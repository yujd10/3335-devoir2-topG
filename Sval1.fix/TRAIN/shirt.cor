Steeb, playing in his home city, allowed himself to become a marketing tool, with little consideration for the traditions of this fine old competition. 
Nike, who did not mind Andre Agassi wearing shocking pink cycling tights underneath his black shorts to complement a black, pink and white <tag "506479">shirt</> at the Masters, sent Steeb out in a similarly garish beach bum costume here: a dark blue and white shirt with vertical pink flashes, and grey denim shorts.

And there was no getting away from it, he could be very charming, for instance always ready to tell her she looked nice, and usually with better timing than just now. 
She thought anyway she probably looked about as nice this evening as she ever would, going to be thirty-two in the autumn, a little tall for her own liking, a little ruddy-cheeked, but with abundant browny-red hair a few people seemed to think was quite attractive, trimmed rather short as it was nowadays and scraped back behind not-too-bad ears.

For his Paris debut in 1944 Montand wore a garish check jacket which prompted a cry of `zazou" (pretty boy) from the gallery.

800072
That wasn't surprising, given the denseness of the throng. 
What was dismaying, however, was the sedateness of the gathering, the low voices, the dark suits and ties (I was conscious of standing out in my baggy white suit and light blue open-neck <tag "506479">shirt</>), and above all the absence of women.

AT THIS time of the year, danger stalks the unwary traveller abroad.

She slept naked only when she had a lover. 
She had learned over the years that when her bedtime hands reached for the <tag "521313">T-shirt</> then the affair was over, and sometimes this happened well before she had even half-conscious stirrings that the fun time was passed and that the long slow tide had turned. 

800091
She spends a long time getting dressed. 
I can watch her this time cos she pulls her trousers and stuff on under her dressing gown,  and hides behind the cupboard door when she puts her <tag "506479">shirt</> on.   

800092
She moved the rickety tin ashtray, with its residue of ash trapped in comers, and began to speak. 
Her companion, a streetwise young man with lank hair and a drab <tag "514748">sweatshirt</> that had started life white, lit a cigarette and blew smoke in her face. 

800093
But the memory lane he points the audience down isn't one that starts in Britain. 
Dragging open a curtain to reveal an advancing line of emaciated near-cadavers in filth-caked concentration camp uniforms, he takes you back to Auschwitz. 
Here, as inmates with red-rimmed eyes and ash-grey faces barter items like a <tag "506479">shirt</> or a spoon for half a bowl of soup, a nightmarish market economy is seen in operation.   

800094
The tiger rugs' fabulous abstracted stripy patterns in rusts, ochre and black have now inspired designers and retailers. 
Sweaters, scarves, <tag "506479">shirts</> and boots are all appearing with the tiger's hallmarks.

I was in a jewellery shop when a black teenager in a torn, dirty 
<tag "521313">T-shirt</> and jeans rang the bell.

Half-way through their innings Notts had made only 69. 
But they had lost no more wickets, and together Tim Robinson, crisp and starched as an evening <tag "506479">shirt</>, and Paul Johnson, a stumpy thumper, were laying the bones of a match-winning stand of 132 in 29 overs.   

800097
Britain and the US are conducting a smear campaign against Iraq, and another Middle East war is `inevitable" unless Washington curbs Israeli aggression, the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussain, said in a Wall Street Journal interview published yesterday. 
THE FBI videotape of the arrest on drugs charges of Washington's Mayor, Marion Barry, was shown to the jury in his trial yesterday and simultaneously broadcast on US television. 
The damning and dramatic black and white film showed Mr Barry standing in a hotel room, in <tag "506479">shirt</> and braces, inhaling deeply on a pipe for smoking crack cocaine.  

800098
The overblown blurb makes much of Jonathan Davies's `defection" to Widnes. 
He `joined a lonely legion of Welshmen when he became the 154th to foresake the sacred red <tag "506540">shirt</> &ellip. to take money offered by rugby league".  

800099
Everybody smiled at the light. 
People strolled through the streets with no particular place to go; the men with their jackets slung over one shoulder, <tag "506678">shirt</> sleeves rolled up, ties stuffed in their trouser pockets while the women swayed and fluttered in their light, bright cotton frocks.

Armani lightweight suits at #400 a throw were in the window of Carl Alberti's in the centre of Bologna, but the young manageress said: `The fans, I think, are more interested in what they drink than what they wear." 
The British Bulldog has now become part of the European football fans" currency, appearing on the T-shirts of Dutch, German and English fans alike, usually growling and spitting. 
But the <tag "521306">shirt</> slogan that has caused more flutters is the `Lock Up Yer Daughters" model, or `Tenete Sotto Chiave Le Vostre Figlie" as Corriere della Sera helpfully translated it. 

800102
Despite his illness his ineffable carnality grabbed one's senses even as the distinction of his clothing grabbed the mind. 
He was wearing a forest-green suit with a shell-pink <tag "506479">shirt</> under a representation of a Merton College, Oxford, soccer team tie in alternate stripes of silver and bright pink.   

800103
His eyes glaze over as he focuses on the photograph of him with his beloved &dash. Illona Staller, better known as Cicciolina, the Italian porn star turned politician who recently made headlines by offering to let Saddam Hussein `rape" her if he freed the hostages being held in the Middle East. 
`She's wearing red plastic boots," I say, trying to seem unaffected. 
Koons takes the photograph in his hand and smiles impishly, looking every bit the boy-next-door in his Reeboks, jeans and button-down <tag "506479">shirt</>.   

800104
There seems little to hide: The Gap began in 1969 as a jeans and record store serving San Francisco's counter-culture and has diversified and succeeded by tracking the changing aspirations and ways of living of its original customers, the baby-boomers. 
At the end of the Eighties, The Gap is an anti-designer panacea, a dealer of great white T-shirts, chino pants, sweatshirts, tracksuits and denims to the recovering fashion junkies of the Nineties. 
Above left: Richard Stepney, 30, partner at mens' hair studio Atlas Associates, London, wears navy and white-striped cotton <tag "521313">T-shirt</>, #8; blue jeans, approximately #24.

The children would be the first to spot us. 
As we approached a village, they would scream `barang, barang" at the tops of their voices and tear off to tell everyone of the strange apparition. 
The women, usually wearing only bras and sarongs, would hastily put on their silk blouses, the men would don <tag "506479">shirts</>, and from somewhere an old person would be produced who could remember a few words of greeting in the foreign language: `Bonjour, messieurs."

`In a minute," said Dora. 
Turning from him she caught sight of herself in the long mirror.

Take a muslin nappy or piece of cloth with you to put over your shoulder. 
I learnt this lesson the hard way: I turned up for a dinner party having remembered everything for the baby, even flowers for the hostess, and then the baby was sick all over my lovely silk skirt! 
If you feel shy about breastfeeding in public, wear a loose jumper or <tag "506479">shirt</> so you can push it up and tuck your baby underneath.

I am left to cope with the children and our home while my husband swans around the country in a fast car. 
Then he comes home for sex and ten clean <tag "506479">shirts</> and he is away again.   

800114
Andreas Whittam-Smith of the Independent exuded an air of forbearance and moral rectitude, as if his definition of `newspaper" was on a higher plane than everyone else's. 
His rigid posture and slightly pained expression may have been due to the fact that he was wearing a hair <tag "521312">shirt</>.   

800115
Brown, who has two previous convictions, and was ordered to pay #959 compensation, admitted six offences including the criminal damage and burglaries at St Birinus School; two burglaries at Didcot Bowls Club; and the Walters (Didcot) garage burglary.

He was clean-shaven with straight blond hair and angular features. 
He wore dark trousers with a light cotton <tag "506479">shirt</>.   

800117
Innocuous would be nearer the mark. 
The activists' message scrawled on a wall near the ground is some way removed from the burning passions normally aroused by football, while the <tag "521313">T-shirts</> are more machismo than menace, and pop songs peppered with heavy breathing are apparently in vogue if not in keeping with pre-match entertainment.   

800118
`Men are very bad at sitting, too fidgety and craggy looking. 
But I do like <tag "506479">shirts</> and ties," she says, and finds herself changing women's clothes endlessly, like a cut-out doll, trying different combinations.   

800119
He designed for others (costumes for Diaghilev and embroidery for Schiaparelli), but he also `designed" himself; his unquenchable desire for fame and his talent for self-publicity made him the most photographed man in Paris. 
There are many photographs of Cocteau in his trademark suit staring with absolute assurance into the camera: Cocteau wearing a thick alpaca coat; Cocteau with a dark wool coat flung over his shoulders; Cocteau in dungarees; Cocteau in a duffel coat with Chanel. 
He was photographed by Man Ray in a sharp, dark suit with a striped <tag "506479">shirt</> and white collar. 

800120
Who the rise was due to I don't know except that I think David probably wouldn't have had the idea to have opened such wonderful offices and created such a great mystique about it which MainMan had. 
Everything looked great from the writing paper to the <tag "521313">T-shirts</> and the stickers &dash. just everything was done well.   

800121
It was the use of `pirate" photographs of herself which  most upset and frustrated Kylie. 
She claimed photographers  who took pictures of her as she walked the streets or  appeared at public events were then making a fortune by  selling their shots to companies ready to churn out posters,  <tag "521313">T-shirts</> and magazines by the million.   

800122
The real Disneyland is ten miles outside the city, but we were told that nobody goes there. 
Instead they're all here, eating Kentuck Fried Chicken in their Union Jack <tag "521313">T-shirts</>. 

800123
The difficulties encountered by the QM Department in supplying the similar khaki uniform authorized for enlisted men are described in Part 1 of this article. 
In practice the troops who fought in Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines wore a mixture of blue and khaki, and during 1898-99 the dark blue pullover <tag "506479">shirt</> and light blue kersey trousers were the most common field dress. 

800124
He was well suited. 
The party still retained something of its pre-war sleekness; elderly gentlemen in Trumper's haircuts, wearing cream silk <tag "506479">shirts</> and Brigade or Old Etonian ties.   

800125
Disputes abound, mostly footling. 
Boris Becker &dash. a critic of the place for its `snobbishness" and inadequate practice facilities &dash. was tut-tutted for wearing a <tag "506479">shirt</> not predominantly white, while a West German junior was playing in a similar one on an outside court.

Henry brushed and spat into the basin, noticing the blood darken the snow-white saliva. 
He would get the poison today. 
Humming to himself, he went back into the bedroom and put on a pair of grey corduroy trousers, a red <tag "506479">shirt</> and a bright turquoise jumper, stained with food. 

800127
They spoke of the need to persist in `the struggle" and they spoke in honour of those who, over the years, had died for the cause. 
Above all they made it resoundingly clear that after 29 years in exile, or underground, or in disguise, the ANC was back to stay. 
Eloquently illustrating the point was the number of stalls around the stadium selling newly designed ANC <tag "521313">T-shirts</>, which everyone seemed to be wearing.   

800128
Others are almost exhilarated. 
`I survived the quake" and `Earthquake 89" <tag "521313">T-shirts</> were on sale within 24 hours.   

800129
It was a sort of club or summat I think. 
When the kettle boils, she pours the water in the sink and puts some cold water in. 
Then she turns her back on me and pulls her <tag "506479">shirt</> over her head and chucks it in the corner.

In each face and figure you could decipher signs of not only one continent, but of several. 
You saw a lightweight cotton <tag "506479">shirt</> from Africa, and from Lithuania &dash. high boots; a leather jacket from United States combined with a fur-lined cap with ear-flaps from Canada.   

800131
`Do come in." 
`Cheers." 
There were stains on his bomber jacket but his <tag "521313">tee-shirt</> and jeans were fairly clean and his hair was not too bad.

Brian Everthorpe takes a chair at the far end of the table, slightly withdrawn as if to mark his difference from the engineers. 
Vic sits at the head of the table, in his <tag "506679">shirtsleeves</>, half a cup of cold coffee at his right hand.   

800133
Tommy Hicks was renamed Steele by a New Zealand entrepeneur called John Kennedy, who offered to make him a star there and then in the coffee bar basement. 
He dressed him in a white suit and silk <tag "506479">shirts</> designed by the tennis designer, Teddy Tinling, and got him a pair of blue suede shoes in honour of the rock number by Carl Perkins &dash. `Do what you want but don't step on my blue suede shoes". 

800134
Only gradually was I learning to adjust; learning to take some pleasure in their twofold existence &dash. .in their own consciousness and between the covers of novels bearing my name, somewhat inaccurately, as author. 
Surkov, in a Yale <tag "521313">T-shirt</>, was sitting alone at a table when I went down to a late breakfast.

RIGHT NOW, Five Thirty are as enthusiastic as ever. 
Tara, with his lumberjack <tag "506479">shirt</> and messy hair than hangs irritatingly over his right eye; Paul with his pudding bowl cut and lightly flared jeans (their sole acknowledgement of prevailing fashion trends) and Phil with his goofy grin and ramshackle cut. 

800136
Shit, hell. 
Dad's <tag "506479">shirts</> won't be dry in time, they're still dripping into the bath."   

800137
Hamnett's design reputation is contradictorily positioned somewhere in the avant garde, even though her work is steeped in nostalgia. 
School uniforms, Sixties starlets and rockers have all been her inspiration, while the slogan <tag "521313">T-shirts</> themselves were less of an invention than a Woodstock revival.   

800138
He wore his suits very tight and his collars very large. 
He clashed striped <tag "506479">shirts</>, check jackets and spotted ties. 

800139
However, some of our Tour players should aim to be better ambassadors.

At least Egypt try to get the ball down and pass to feet.

Mimi didn't know. 
`Well, they'll have to," said Nicholson pulling the necktie from his <tag "506479">shirt</> and flinging it across the back of a chair. 

800144
He entered unobtrusively under the barbed wire between the trees in the outer corner. 
He wore a straw hat and flannels and wide red braces over the neat white <tag "506479">shirt</>.   

800145
A juke box started up. 
We stared at a girl in a too-short red <tag "521313">T-shirt</>, the writhing, glistening flesh in the pit of her back exposed.  

800146
`On my left, ladies and gentlemen, is the casket containing the body of Ambassador Melloy &ellip 
" It was the soft-shoe the&acute.atre noir for prime time television, broken only by the agitated voice of an American security guard wearing a blue <tag "521313">T-shirt</> yelling: `Come on.   

800147
He dabbed at it with a wet face-flannel without much effect, except for creating a damp halo around the original spot. 
It was the only tie he had, though, and he could hardly wear an open-necked <tag "506479">shirt</> with his striped suit.   

800148
He looked sideways at Toby. 
Toby had put on a clean <tag "506479">shirt</> and a jacket but no tie, for his trip to town.   

800149
There was no room to open the door even halfway, but there was a fan, and at 50 baht (about #1.25) per night I was not complaining. 
You can to find cheap accommodation, eat in numerous small restaurants with menus in English, buy tickets to anywhere in Thailand (or anywhere in the world), get your laundry done or deposit luggage.

800150
One of the most celebrated is the 1980 Man in a Polyester Suit. 
It shows a man in a suit and waistcoat from lower lapel to mid-thigh, a tuck of <tag "506479">shirt</> emerging from his fly and casually nearby, his large (black) penis in repose. 

800151
Boxer had professed his hatred for Asians many times, Debbie Baker said, and several times she had seen him deliberately provoke fights with Asians. 
By the time of the trial, Boxer had given up his skinhead appearance, wearing a white shirt, thin dark tie, and narrow-legged jeans. 
Tactically, inevitably, his hair had grown so that only small piece of tattoo was visible above his <tag "521306">shirt</> collar.   

800152
Also, does the disco not have correct insurance cover for theft or damage to peoples' clothes and other possessions? 
On this occasion, I also noticed that a young man who was waiting to get into the disco was wearing a very smart suit with a denim <tag "506479">shirt</> underneath. 

800153
On such occasions, a ban on reaction shots is a small but not unimportant reporting restriction. 
Of the more altruistic objections, the most frequent is that telvisation will encourage both bad behaviour and the yelling of satirical flipperies in the style of Dennis Skinner. 
On the first point, suppose that you are a (probably Opposition) MP who plans to interrupt the Budget or wear a Nicaraguan Solidarity <tag "521313">T-shirt</> on the backbench.  

800154
At which point it was necessary to establish that while there might be a number of indifferent referees at work in the Football League none of them is corruptible. 
Their integrity remains beyond question but the worrying impression is that far too many now fall into the former category. 
IF HE could have been persuaded to pull on a tangerine <tag "506540">shirt</>, even for five minutes, Sir Stanley Matthews would probably have tripled the attendance for Saturday's FA Cup re-match of the famous `Matthews final" between Blackpool and Bolton Wanderers.   

800155
In the first part of the film Brian Kelly is an average skater wearing all the right gear &dash. shorts, T-shirts with skulls and crossbones. 
They all wear Bones Brigade T-shirts (this is surely free advertising &dash. the Bones Brigade is a professional team who tour the world). 
Then to impress a girl he changes, much to the amazement of his friends, into the <tag "506479">shirt</> and tie preppy look.   

800156
Today a film is a spiralling serial event. 
It's the sneak preview magazine article, the trailer, the review, the comic / book / <tag "521313">T-shirt</> / toy of the film, the TV special about the making of the film, the spin-off series, the re-edited video release and finally the sequel, which starts it all off again.   

800157
Over the past year its image has been brilliantly promoted by a series of black and white print and billboard ads in which good-looking arty and sporty achievers are photographed by Herb Ritts, Matthew Rolston and Steven Meisel. 
Hollywood starlets and aspiring beefcake, fashion editors, film-makers and boxers have been shown alongside Miles Davis, Verushka, Kim Basinger and the American elder statesman of fashion design, Geoffrey Beene, all wearing Gap clothes their way. 
That the company has persuaded cult figures to promote the humble Gap pocketed <tag "521313">T-shirt</>, which sells at #8, is an achievement in itself, but despite being showered with advertising awards and press attention, Mickey Drexler, The Gap's president, has a policy of dodging personal publicity and making sure his executives keep their names out of the papers.

There was stabbings there every week." 
In the gents loo, an old guy sits doing the Daily Record crossword while the red-faced clubbers wearing a mixture of sportsgear, the odd Happy Mondays G-Mex <tag "514748">sweatshirt</>, ponchos and flares set to work on their hair with free gel and mousse.   

800159
Robert was there already. 
He was just wearing a <tag "506479">shirt</> and trousers.   

800160
Walking in the opposite direction, down from the Heath, but unseen by Abdus Sattar, were two young men: a skinhead, Anthony Carroll, usually known as Boxer, and his friend Paul Scouller. 
Boxer wore the traditional skinhead uniform: heavy Doctor Martens boots, rolled-up jeans and a <tag "521313">T-shirt</>.   

800161
I was starting to make close friendships, express more anger &dash. in fact I didn't feel empty at all but full, full of plans and ideas and feelings and senses. 
The colours and smells of the market were sharp: the oranges and plantain, the <tag "521313">T-shirts</>, toys and tea towels bright and startling &dash. the smells almost drowned me; and every week I visited her I learned to trust her more, dared to feel more of my feelings, instead of eating them away.   

800162
Not a bad time then to reflect on the debt athletics, and indeed all sports, owes to sponsors at all levels: Thanks Kodak. 
LOCAL radio station Fox FM is helping Abingdon Amblers get in tune for this year's London Marathon on April 22. 
Fox has kitted out Amblers' 16 London Marathon runners with the station's <tag "521313">tee-shirts</> which will no doubt be seen pounding the roads leading up to the big race day.

`How are you getting on, Mr Wilcox?" 
`Mr Wilcox is scandalized by our lax habits," said Robyn. 
`Open-necked <tag "506479">shirts</> and open-ended coffee-breaks."

`I washed them," he said. 
`Pullover and trousers and a <tag "506479">shirt</>.

She doubled the doses of tranquillisers, craving peace from the chaotic jumble of events around her, and without a single conscious thought obtained another prescription from the doctor at Aston Langley. 
She tried to choose a significant object to remember Alex by, but nothing spoke to her and in the end she packed four of his old rugby <tag "506540">shirts</> with her luggage and returned to Kingston.   

800166
The same cannot be said of Tour de France 1990 (C4), which spoils a lot of nice views of French countryside by intruding an unaesthetic snake of bicyclists into the picture at all times, but the coverage included an interesting item about the Caravan Publicitaire, a procession of cars and vans and novelty vehicles which covers the route ahead of the racers and distributes plastic carrier bags and similar tat to the over-excited populace and derives much publicity and goodwill for the commercial sponsors. 
The balance is clearly a delicate one; too far ahead of the race and the masses have not gathered in sufficient numbers, too close and they aren't interested in your tawdry largesse at all, and of course you must never never get in the way of the cyclists, but the cars disguised as Kicker boots or cream cakes were certainly good for a giggle. 
The reporter Gary Imlach conducted a 30-mile-an-hour barter with one participant and acquired four ice cream Mars bars for a Channel Four <tag "521313">T-shirt</>.

It will take a lifetime for companies like Nike and Adidas to realise that their designers have too many coloured pencils. 
Meanwhile, the cash-in merchants are hard at work, creating crap <tag "521313">T-shirts</> with `Old Skool" printed on the front, stealing the logos of the big names of the Seventies like Puma and trying to re-create clothing from old photos.

Ogilvy was addicted to words that the straight-talking huckster-style admen of the day would blink at.

Nevertheless he conveyed it to her now with a sort of wink that her recent or even less recent difficulties would not be raised during the current conversation. 
He was smartly dressed in a <tag "506479">shirt</> of unidentifiable material and a suit of which it would have been possible to say with certainty only that it had not been made in an English-speaking country.

As she stood in the kitchen, clutching a teddy bear, her influence stretched like elastic. 
In the office the boss was chewing lumps off her husband because he had not had Kellogg's for breakfast and his colleagues were recoiling with looks of loathing because his <tag "506479">shirt</> was whiter than theirs.

But she did not sleep. 
Almost immediately, even while she still thought that she might be able to sleep, she felt quietly and insistently the call of her night-dark lover and she runkled up her <tag "521313">T-shirt</> and felt up her own warm soft skin for her left breast.   

800182
She stood up, swaying, and walked painfully to the head of the stairs. 
There below, in front of the fireplace, a woman knelt with newspaper, kindling wood and coal, making up the fire with the skill of much practice. 
She wore jeans and a very clean pink <tag "514748">sweatshirt</> which was not the ideal attire for this dirty job, but Lorcan's masculine blue-and-white apron protected her clothes.  

800184
They were bastions of American pride. 
The attraction of swiping at such corporate goliaths was irresistible to someone who made his name in Europe by taking on the stuffed <tag "506479-x">shirts</> of the City establishment &ellip. in rather the same way he defied social conventions by openly keeping a mistress and family in one country and a wife and children in another.   

800185
The injured Tony Agana's absence left Brian Deane looking like the remaining blade in a pair of shears. 
Dave Bassett's team, in a more literate age, would have worn on their <tag "506479">shirts</> that French military motto `L'audace, toujours l'audace", the most precise summary of their style; ceaseless bombardment followed by the onrush of Deane and Agana through a dazed defence.

Later, caught pressing his <tag "506479">shirts</> on the container ship half-way across the Pacific, he launched into an ocker monologue, about macho ironing techniques and the manliness of the soiling on his laundry.

Some say that inflation has reached 1,000 per cent, while others claim it to be 5,000 per cent. 
This was a real debate in a multi-party parliament, with a full chamber following references to documents to which their attention was directed by the Finance Minister, and laughing appreciatively at an intervention by a burly Solidarity frontbencher previously notorious for wearing only a <tag "521313">T-shirt</> and jeans, now uneasily elegant in a suit and tie.   

800194
Vivienne Westwood's Kings Road shop changed its name yet again to become World's End, and started showing collections. 
The 1980 collection was the pirate look: white frilly <tag "506479">shirts</> and baggy knee length trousers devised for Adam Ant, collected by the V &and. A, and much favoured by those of a New Romantic persuasion.

Apparently, two critics were so `totally hung up on the blackness" that they boycotted Simon's uniquely powerful &dash. and graceful RSC Isabella.

INDEED, THERE is nothing trivial about the impact the Neds have had this year. 
For all the proof you need, look no further than this year's Reading Festival and the amazing response the Neds got for some <tag "521313">T-shirts</> that they had made especially for the occasion.   

800201
The difference is the price. 
Women's bomber jackets are #54.99, washed silk <tag "506479">shirts</> #34.99.   

800202
Or perhaps he was always like this. 
More likely he was just going on showing his disapproval of Desmond's turquoise rally-squad <tag "514748">sweatshirt</>, on-the-forehead hairdo and non-RAF way of talking, having opened the proceedings with a brilliant display of doubt whether the chappie in the doorway had been offering himself as a customer or was just a passing street ruffian.   

800203
Alison ran out and came back with Gildas. 
Gildas, thinner than ever, stood a moment, wrinkling up his face and holding up his drooping hands in a way which Jack called his insect pose. 
Though it was a warm day, he was wearing his old faded high-necked sweater with a frayed <tag "521306">shirt</> collar showing.   

800204
The square rippled with 10,000 red flags bearing the PT (Workers' Party) star emblem and the hammer and sickle.

Manhattan's designers have been playing up their strengths for next spring with collections which were full of vigour if not surprise. 
Ralph Lauren was on peak form with his witty pastiche of French naval style &dash. horizontally striped navy and white <tag "521313">T-shirts</>, pleated red trousers and jackets with rows of gold buttons and stand-up gold braid collars.   

800212
`And haven't we Dollymount?" he said, with further relish, hesitant before throwing in Sandymount and Stillorgan. 
He went on to say that innocent people visited these haunts and never registered their bawdy associations. 
`I believe there's a Carnal Way somewhere," Dr Fitz said, not wanting to be lacking in a reply, and he pulled at the <tag "506678">shirtsleeve</> of Bill the Barrow Boy, who stood nearby.

They were already dressed for the wedding, wearing little bits of borrowed fineries they were afraid he would notice. 
The boy was wearing his blue suit, shining black shoes, white <tag "506479">shirt</> and blue tie and his fair hair was oiled.

The editorial in the New Statesman announced that poison was `well and truly ensconced in the bloodstream of our national life", blamed the low wages paid to employees of supermarkets and demanded swift action. 
The Sun (`GIVE HIM A DOSE OF HIS OWN MEDICINE) led the call for a new, possibly chemically based method of execution for dealing with this kind of pervert. 
An enterprising youth set up a stall in the High Street, selling Poisoner Products (<tag "521313">T-shirts</>, plastic syringes and Poisoner Peppermints &dash. `Suck them and you do feel queer!") before he was moved on by a policeman who had somehow got left out of the house-to-house search.   

800221
Trowark style is large, enveloping and extremely cosy with an almost indestructible quality &dash. one five-year-old jumper seen by The Independent is only just beginning to look `broken in" after years of frequent machine washing and hard wear. 
Only medium and large sizes are made in these real men's jumpers, but the large linen <tag "506479">shirt</> makes a wonderful tunic for a woman of average size and will probably keep her knees nice and warm.

On stage he wore a white sailor's outfit &dash. baggy trousers, <tag "506479">shirt</> and a {typo bad="smakeskin",good="snakeskin"} jacket &dash. and a sailor's hat, an outfit that had been designed by Natasha Kornilof.

THIS week thousands of families all over Britain will spend frantic Saturdays and frenzied Sundays trying to organise their summer holidays. 
They will be the families who do not plan their rest and recreation with the passionate intensity which is now fashionable &dash. the sort of people who, until a year or two ago, thought of leisure wear as <tag "506479">shirts</> with frayed collars and trousers too old to be worn at work.

`Though you must subordinate the managerial [to the pastoral and spiritual functions of the Church]," he argues, `you can't be unrealistic about it." 
His episcopal purple <tag "506479">shirt</> and pinstripe suit underline the point. 

800231
A bumpy pitch made control difficult but that was still not a good enough excuse for the number of times United gave the ball away. 
Striker John Durnin was having a particularly bad time in holding the ball up and then finding someone in the same coloured <tag "506540">shirt</> as his own.   

800232
The invitation had insisted `gentlemen will wear ties". 
I have one tie but it looks stupid with a <tag "521313">tee-shirt</> and leather jacket.   

800233
Now he is back, as bouncy as ever, part of manager Alex Ferguson's youth coaching team, working with Eric Harrison and Brian Kidd to produce United's next installment in the generation game. 
Stiles, the man whose biting tackle and toothless grin made him a World Cup legend back in 1966, did not perhaps have the silky skills to place him alongside the all-time greats of Sir Matt Busby's Soccer Academy. 
But no-one ever wore the red <tag "506540">shirt</> with greater pride and passion.

With much better weather now promised, a colourful second week looms. 
Not too colourful in the shirt department, warns the All England Club, which is having increasing difficulty enforcing the `predominantly white" rule as designs become ever more grotesque.

Caldecott saw his responsibility, at a time when Penguin had ceased to be synonymous with paperback, as to ensure that Lane's mighty bird remained in business by being competitive with Pan, Corgi and Fontana . 
This meant, to some degree, that the `orange" list became more `popular" (but nothing like as `down-market" as it was to plunge in later years). 
In a memoir of his 35 years in publishing (before joining Penguin Caldecott, who had come from Cape Town to work for Shell, was employed by Phoenix House and Readers Union), he wrote of the Sixties, This was the period of protest, satire, and the youth/underground/pop culture of Oz and IT, of mini-skirts and flowered <tag "506479">shirts</>, of illustrated covers on Penguins and of rumoured (but mainly rumoured) sexual permissiveness &ellip

`I guess he knew that if he didn't win Sweden would have a good chance with Stefan playing in the last match," Wilander said. 
Edberg, in the event, ended the tie and avoided too much eye strain by beating Steeb, who again sported a garish blue, white and pink <tag "506479">shirt</> and grey denim shorts, 6-2, 6-4 in the `dead" rubber to make the score a respectable 3-2 in Sweden's seventh consecutive final.   

800246
How could I have gone off after she had spent five solid minutes observing with wonder the way my proverbials moved up and down ceaselessly like an oil-well pump as I lay otherwise motionless sprawled on the bed? 
Her sigh meant, `And after all that, here I am in this apartment with a balcony, engaged, having just had a shower and wearing a yellow <tag "506479">shirt</> that I like, with the living room starting to look all right, and what a close call it all was!   

800247
Only Rugby Union holds out against the commercial tide despite widespread speculation about covert payments to players. 
Cricket, The game of the British amateur par excellence, is now sponsored by tobacco firms and insurance companies whilst footballers advertise everything from double-glazing to Guinness on their <tag "506479">shirts</>.   

800248
But then I thought this might not be understood by many people, and also, by the time it got to the Augean Bulls and the Birds of Stymphalus, it would be a little recondite for people like Terry Coleman." 
Quite right; but I'd had a vague recollection, and looked it up, and although the <tag "506479">shirt</> of the centaur Nessus, saturated as it was in his poisoned blood, had caused Hercules no end of pain &ellip

One more caress and it dimmed or went out.)

All six Oxford entries made it to the final list of 50 in categories for children's, men's and women's wear. 
In the final selection, the cotton designs of Chinese student Yi Ying Hu impressed celebrity judges including Carol Decker, the lead singer of pop group T'Pau, to take the #500 second prize in the women's wear section. 
Miss Hu, 39, of Sunningwell Road, Oxford, made a Jacobean patterned quilted jacket, <tag "506479">shirt</>, jodphurs and peak hat all in natural Indian cotton.   

800252
That the company has persuaded cult figures to promote the humble Gap pocketed T-shirt, which sells at #8, is an achievement in itself, but despite being showered with advertising awards and press attention, Mickey Drexler, The Gap's president, has a policy of dodging personal publicity and making sure his executives keep their names out of the papers. 
There seems little to hide: The Gap began in 1969 as a jeans and record store serving San Francisco's counter-culture and has diversified and succeeded by tracking the changing aspirations and ways of living of its original customers, the baby-boomers. 
At the end of the Eighties, The Gap is an anti-designer panacea, a dealer of great white <tag "521313">T-shirts</>, chino pants, sweatshirts, tracksuits and denims to the recovering fashion junkies of the Nineties.

First results are expected today in Tokyo municipal elections in which a bad result is anticipated for Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party and possibly the consequent resignation of the Prime Minister, Mr Sosuke Uno. 
Two major Washington dry-cleaning associations have agreed to urge their members not to charge more to launder a woman's <tag "506479">shirt</> than a man's, after three law students investigated `sex-based pricing discrimination" for a study project.-Washington Post.

In St Thomas, my tum still felt funny, so I got the name of a local doctor and turned up at his surgery in a shopping mall. 
He was wearing a lurid Hawaiian style <tag "506479">shirt</> and had tattoos on his arm.   

800255
A spreading moustache and a scarlet brass-buttoned waistcoat went with them a treat. 
Earlier there had been a tremendous clashing of carving-knife and steel as the fellow strode up and down the narrow aisle between the tables and a great hollow clopping noise of spoon in jug while he mixed a dressing or a sauce. 
It must have been he who had painted the bottom third of the front window dark green, furniture-van green, and had covered the walls with light framed photographs of unidentifiable scenes of town and country, a kind of boat-race with the crews in <tag "506679">shirt-sleeves</>, two glum middle-aged women by a sundial in a formal garden, a crowd of people, some on bicycles, leaving a factory, a toothy buffoon wearing a battered tweed hat and brandishing what might have been an authentic shepherd's crook.   

800256
The Camp Fire Girls filed out; I hovered, but I was too aware of a museum staff person waiting outside to try to touch TAM's knee. 
And bicycling home I found that already TAM'S knee, her nude immobile physical self, was becoming less interesting than the idea of the real woman who had been paid to do TAM'S voice. 
Even years later I would think of this unknown woman in the recording studio with the script in front of her, leaning very close to the microphone so that every intimate palatal event that accompanied her words was recorded, reading about her innocent spleen or thyroid or skeletal system, and yet thinking as she took her professional breaths at each set of dot-dot-dots that the moment when she would have to say, `And these are my breasts," was coming ever closer: Would she bring out the sentence with the relaxed, full-lipped, mature aplomb that she as a trained and highly paid voice was expected to have, when reading these words was in the world of sound equivalent to standing up in the thickly carpeted room and letting her <tag "506479">shirt</> fall open and holding her arms apart for the instantly tit-maddened audio technicians beyond the glass?   

800257
`Who's first?" 
`Me," says a pretty, dark-haired girl wearing an outsize man's <tag "506479">shirt</> like an artist's smock over her jeans and sweater.   

800258
Advising them tried her patience, but on this occasion restored her enfeebled sense of purpose. 
`I'm wasting my time on this Santiago business," she told Claude, who sat on the steps a few yards away, the glow from the house highlighting his white <tag "506479">shirt</> and the shine on his forehead where the hair was receding.   

800259
She transferred her attention to the boy. 
The boy sat in an attitude of very slightly self-conscious grace, one long leg stretched out and almost touching Dora's. 
He wore dark grey flannels and a white open-necked <tag "506479">shirt</>.

A gesture of quality outstanding even amid Arsenal's quantity. 
Wimbledon &ellip.1 Liverpool &ellip.2 PESTAKILL, The Blue Light Fly Killer, are the people who put the <tag "506540">shirt</> on defender John Scales's back, but it was their expertise in bug control as well as kit sponsorship that Wimbledon could have done with against Liverpool.

A Complete Record of the North American Soccer League ( #17.95) is a must for those who sentimentalise the Seventies footballer with mop-top and sideburns, it tells the story of the illusory success of Pele, Beckenbauer, Best et al, and the vain struggle to build on it of home-grown journeymen like Joe Fink, Siggy Stritzl and Shep Messing (who, it transpires, appeared nude as a centrefold in Viva). 
Everything you ever wanted to know (and rather more) about Team Hawaii, New England Tea Men, and Colorado Caribous with their camp, fringed <tag "506479?">shirts</>, though tantalisingly little on a remarkably named San Diego Sockers midfielder, Julie Veee.

There were forms to complete in duplicate, and questions that required the declaration of every penny in your pocket and of the pocket itself.

These were also the times when `big bellied women" were carted and dumped in neighbouring parishes, forcibly if necessary, to avoid the expense of an extra child on the parish. 
The records show that workhouse inmates were fed mutton and turnip broth for a week at a time and that clothing was a big item of expenditure: tailoring, shoe leather, thread, <tag "521306">shirt</> buttons, starch, washing and ironing.   

800264
He pulled off his jacket and folded it up beside him. 
Marcus was in <tag "506679">shirt</> sleeves, looking rather more dandyish in a clean shirt, indeed a new, shirt, evidently bought for him by Irina.

After Eton and Balliol, Oxford (where he shared rooms with Lord `Grey" Gowrie) he went into the City. 
A monogrammed `C" on his striped <tag "506479">shirt</> is the only thing that marks him out from a thousand other affluent middle-aged men within a hundred yards of his office above the Thames.

They stayed until their tiredness meant their ritual wailing turned to real tears of grief. 
At the funeral, some draped their husband's <tag "506479">shirt</> around their shoulders.   

800267
I'll think of the look I want &dash. at the moment I like to look `French'; you know, sophisticated and Parisian &dash. so I'll lay everything out on the bed, plan what shoes, what make-up, hairstyle, earrings, the lot. 
Even if it's just a casual look &dash. say, jeans, a <tag "521313">T-shirt</> and a sweater &dash. then generally I've thought it through: which lipstick would look best, some subtle jewellery.   

800268
It was quite amazing. 
David was a character known as Cloud I think. 
I dressed him in this huge pink <tag "506479">shirt</> with maroon spots on, with a big maroon and pink ruff and {typo bad="litle",good="little"} knee britches in grey with red velvet stripes on them.  

800269
She had decided right then that she was working on her last series of `Heritage". 
They were dressed alike in jeans and chequered <tag "506479">shirts</>.  

800270
After withdrawing a small amount, and confirming that the cheque for #10,000 had not arrived, he went to a cafe&acute. a few yards away, a French-styled Do&circ.me with walls made of doors that opened on to the sunny pavement. 
In the tiny basin in the men's lavatory he washed his face and hands, then sat in <tag "506679">shirtsleeves</> in a shady corner of the bar, his dirty jacket folded beside him and the hat in his bag.   

800271
They reject the now proletarian matt black designer house and car for the rustic-elite of a rambling country house and horses. 
But take a closer look and the contrivedly worn in <tag "521313">T-shirt</> and track pants will have expensive labels and a Rolex might well lurk beneath the frayed cuff of a carefully distressed sweatshirt.   

800272
Hats are gone, replaced by hoods attached to jackets and trimmed with fur, always fake. 
Legs are skinny and taper neatly into boots, unimpeded by bulky socks: the latest models are lighter, with padding only at pressure points. 
Polo-neck sweaters with busy patterns are fun, but more practical under ski suits are regular sweat <tag "514748">shirts</> with hoods. 

800273
Still, the Whitehaven supporters can draw comfort from the fact that their fate is shared by an altogether less established operation. 
The dwindling numbers in the City have done for <tag "506479-p">Shirt</> Rack, the niche retailer. 

800274
Bowood was to become less of a family seat, and more of a leisure complex. 
From a single ice-cream kiosk in the early seventies, the house has spawned a restaurant, museum, gift-shop, appalling wax-works, adventure playground, garden centre and pick-your-own fruit farm. 
`Please wear your <tag "506479">shirt</> in the house", the brown and white notices request. 

800275
When Fiona heard that she felt better again, and sat down in her dressing-gown in front of the TV with a Marlboro and, not bothering to go back to the Jacobean tumbler she had been drinking out of, punished the White Nun out of her tea-mug until it was time to dress. 
By then she was feeling more or less up to things and found it almost fun to assemble the fairly new black Dorothy Perkins suit (Harry's Christmas present), diamond pattern tights, white shirt and suede stilettos. 
The <tag "506479">shirt</>, however, though clean had been lying in a ball on the bed and elsewhere and would need an iron, and the stilettos would make for dodgy walking by the end of her sort of evening. 

800276
`I haven't any pyjamas," said Dora, `they were in the suitcase." 
`You can have one of my <tag "506479">shirts</>," said Paul.   

800277
After that she began to tell them a little about her life in Scotland, particularly her life with the Rosenblooms. 
`Sometimes at the weekend Mr Rosenbloom would come and ask me to iron his shirts. 
He had hundreds of <tag "506479">shirts</> and why he ever wanted me to iron them I'll never know.   

800278
Many of these images are by now familiar, from reproduction of Spender's famous work for Picture Post, or the recent Farson collections, Sacred Monsters and Soho in the Fifties. 
Washing hanging out to dry in Bolton reminds of the women's work while men went to the mills: pillows billow up against ominous banks of clouds, inflated like puffed wheat; vests, <tag "506479">shirts</> and drawers hang desultorily between back-to-backs, while the proudly-lettered tower of Park Mill glowers in the background. 

800279
The term `Managing Director" had suggested to her imagination some figure more grand and gross, with plump, flushed cheeks and wings of silver hair, a rotund torso sheathed in expensively tailored suiting, a gold tiepin and cufflinks, and a cigar wedged between manicured fingers. 
This man was stocky and wiry, like a short-legged terrier, his face was pale and drawn, with two vertical worry-lines scored into the brow above the nose, and the hank of dark, flat hair that fell forward across his brow had clearly never had the attention of an expert barber. 
He was in <tag "506679">shirtsleeves</>, and the shirt did not fit him very well, the buttoned cuffs hanging down over his wrists, like a schoolboy's whose clothes had been purchased with a view to his `growing into" them.   

800280
7 Don't take too many clothes during the season. 
A few sports <tag "506540">shirts</> and a sweater will do; and they'll probably not even have been unpacked when you get home.   

800281
For #200, I expect to be able to buy something that's good-looking and well-designed. 
I've settled now for a sort of uniform during the day of a skirt, silk <tag "506479">shirt</> and a jacket, with a three-quarter length cashmere coat over it in winter.   

800282
With her parents' move to the Isle of Aran, Jakki had next to no money for food after she'd paid her rent. 
`I used to run competitions offering a free <tag "521313">T-shirt</> to the first person who arrived at the station with a burger and chips. 

800283
Freedom: 
the <tag "506479">shirt</> unbuttoned before execution.   

800285
The club's meagre belongings are housed in those three austere, portable sheds while the shunting back and forth to their borrowed stadium is carried out by means of the trusty van. 
On match days kit-man Kendall packs all the gear &dash. literally hundreds of items &dash. into the transit for transport to the ground. 
The paraphernalia of football is all there &ellip. boots, footballs, <tag "506540">shirts</>, shorts, shin-pads, laces, tie-ups, medical and treatment kit, buckets, sponges, ice for the treatment room (and the director's drinks!), goalkeepers' gloves, even a telephone.   

800286
Without referring to his previous intention to read and watch TV with his mum, he said he would see her at Linda's about half-six. 
When Fiona heard that she felt better again, and sat down in her dressing-gown in front of the TV with a Marlboro and, not bothering to go back to the Jacobean tumbler she had been drinking out of, punished the White Nun out of her tea-mug until it was time to dress. 
By then she was feeling more or less up to things and found it almost fun to assemble the fairly new black Dorothy Perkins suit (Harry's Christmas present), diamond pattern tights, white <tag "506479">shirt</> and suede stilettos. 

800287
The autumn edition of its news sheet, The Cellarman, records the increasing popularity of Burton Ale: `Drinkers rate the product very highly and significantly ahead of Directors and Flowers. 
This is also the case among non-drinkers, who recognise that the product has a distinctive taste and flavour." 
For those watching in black and white, the barman is the one in the green <tag "506479">shirt</>. 

800288
James Alexander, 24, of Saxton Road, Abingdon, admitted four shoplifting offences, and three of failing to surrender to custody, when he appeared before Oxford city magistrates yesterday. 
He admitted taking clothes including a jumper, <tag "506479">shirt</> and T-shirt, and three bottles of wine, from shops in Oxford during a shoplifting spree on April 21 last year. 

800289
THE TANKS creep forward, single file. 
Then a man in a white <tag "506479">shirt</> steps in front of them.   

800290
Children's clothes are becoming more fashionable but often quite expensive. 
Kaz has brightly coloured clothes for children aged four to fourteen including coloured denim, burmudas and sweatshirts. 
Many feature pictures of children's favourite characters, including the latest craze Teenage Mutant Hero Turtle, with pictures emblazoned on <tag "521313">t-shirts</>, jeans and sweatshirts.   

800291
`When Peter Casson had his day he was the biggest there was and, of course, what he can't accept is other people coming up. 
At the end of my show there's a bump and grind strip-tease and men take their <tag "506479">shirts</> off and undo their trousers.   

800292
American football is notoriously violent. 
Players in the virtually invincible Yale side around the turn of the century would dip their <tag "506540">shirts</> in blood from an abattoir before a match.   

800293
Are the soldiers Ottoman or Wehrmacht? 
Another old print shows a litter of bodies, young men in white <tag "506540">shirts</>, their stomachs already swelling in the heat, lying spread-eagled beside an orchard.   

800294
Turning from him she caught sight of herself in the long mirror. 
She was barefoot and wearing only Paul's shirt, with sleeves rolled up and well open at the neck. 
The <tag "506479">shirt</> just reached to her thigh, revealing the whole length of her long solid legs.   

800295
The man, believed to be Scottish, was given a lift by a lorry driver at Baynards Green roundabout on the A41 on June 13 &dash. the day Mr Gomm's body was found by the road at Hampton Gay. 
The hitch-hiker's <tag "506479">shirt</> was stained with blood at the front, there was blood on his right hand and he had grazed knuckles, a black right eye and swollen cheek. 

800296
Buddhism and the memory of Genghis Khan, long suppressed by the ruling regime, are experiencing a reawakening, and ownership of private property is to follow soon after the elections. 
The deputy executive secretary of South Gobi aimak, an unassuming character in a <tag "521313">T-shirt</>, typified the ebullient mood of this country nearly the size of Western Europe which has long been overshadowed by the Soviet Union and China.   

800297
Hanns Ebensten, who met John when he was about fourteen and quickly became his best friend, first heard of him from one of John's fellow pupils, Inge May, who with her mother was a lodger at the Ebensten home (they were all German refugees). 
Inge told fascinating stories about this boy who refused to wear the stuffy school uniform but came to classes in a grubby khaki <tag "506479">shirt</> and shorts, would not sit properly on his chair but cross-legged on it, yawned during lessons and often stayed away from school altogether.   

800298
The thing about Mr Healey's delightful book is not only the bloody poetry but the classical allusions. 
After five years as Chancellor of the Exchequer, and after the lost election of 1979, he says he found himself wearing this <tag "506479-p">Shirt</> of Nessus.   

800299
Although his clothes were casual they were not worn carelessly. 
Gower visualized the man shopping, the recognition of the staff in the expensive boutique he frequented, the swift decision about the trousers and <tag "506479">shirt</> and the long time selecting precisely the right leather belt.   

800300
THE AUDIENCE gave no clues as to what lay ahead. 
While 10,000 Maniacs may be an apt epithet for those passing through the ever-changing line-up of his favourite group, the chap in the Fairport Convention re-union <tag "521313">T-shirt</> would have been disappointed if he was expecting cosy folk rock.   

800301
Continentals &dash. and by and large the Celts, as you will no doubt agree &dash. are as a rule unable to control themselves in moments of strong emotion, and are thus unable to maintain a professional demeanour other than in the least challenging of situations. 
If I may return to my earlier metaphor &dash. you will excuse my putting it so coarsely &dash. they are like a man who will, at the slightest provocation, tear off his suit and his <tag "506479">shirt</> and run about screaming. 

800302
It can be horrible if you have a huge bust. 
I'd never wear anything clingy; I might wear a camisole, like this, but I'd put a <tag "506479">shirt</> over it before I went out. 

800303
`Made in Hong Kong."" 
`Marjorie buys my <tag "506479">shirts</>."  

800304
They had too much money. 
They were no longer wearing string vests, they were wearing Lacoste polo <tag "506479">shirts</> with an alligator emblem on the pocket or `Cisco Kid" shirts with diagonal zippers.   

800306
The Times' office manager persuaded David to change before the meal. 
More recently, he turned up to one of President Bush's inauguration ball in a leather jacket, with a white <tag "506479">shirt</> open to the waist.   

800307
Salesmen, too, wear a `uniform". 
White <tag "506479">shirt</>, restrained colour or company tie, grey jacket and trousers and smart shoes.   

800308
`You should sleep on it," he says. 
`I don't want to sleep on it," she says, seizing his hand and shaking it. 
There is a knock on the door and Marion Russell appears at the threshold, wearing an oversized T- <tag "521313">shirt</> with ONLY CONNECT printed on it in big letters.   

800309
Not surprisingly, they failed, with the first outbreak of Gorbymania, to see the fashion asset in the political imagery all around them. 
It was left to Western businessmen to manufacture CCCP <tag "521313">T-shirts</> which ended up on the Soviet black market, an acute case of carrying coals to Newcastle.   

800310
The racquet was then swiftly knocked down to a gnarled old pro for #18 without the boy making another bid. 
`Do you know anything about disc cameras?" asks one of the punters, his vest showing through his <tag "506479">shirt</> and his sweat showing through both; `I bought a whole load of them and I can't find anywhere to put the batteries in."   

800311
The two women passed in the doorway and exchanged glances of pure gratitude. 
In her room Phoebe pulled on her jeans and a <tag "506479">shirt</>, and snatched up a thick pullover and the bottom half of her track suit for Maggie.   

800312
Well, she was not going to go spreading the word about this one, and he could already see the approach of the bonus whereby he would henceforth be able to hate De&acute.sire&acute.e with a clearer conscience than before. 
Howard and Charles were up at the other end among the gladiators, getting everything right, not overdoing the style with touches of cashmere and real cotton <tag "506479">shirts</>, not wanting to talk about the way they had got Fiona and the others up to the hospital, saying they simply happened to be around and did what anyone else would have done, accepting drinks but scrupulously buying back, working hard at pretending nothing had really happened at all.   

800313
THREE WORDS sum up the beat of Broadway this summer: `Eat my shorts!" 
As New York swelters through one of its hottest in recent years, with the thermometer hitting the nineties and humidity levels rising to match, you see them on <tag "521313">T-shirts</>, posters and bumper-stickers. 

800314
This sad memory helped keep me in the running. 
At forty-five seconds Art waved good-bye and put his head on his forearms, and I followed his example: the idea (my idea, in fact &dash. Art Glasheen stole it from me!) was that even the act of holding your head upright used oxygen you needed for the two-minute feat and that if you lay on the desk with every muscle relaxed, looking only at the stripes of your <tag "506678">shirtsleeve</> and allowing them to unfocus and split and then slidingly superimpose themselves on each other in false overlayments, you would survive longer, since the focusing was distracting and the corneal muscles involved were too tiny to demand any oxygen themselves. 

800315
His dark curly hair, though deeply recessed at the temples, had the same effect. 
In the jacket he wore, a kind of mauve blazer with heavy nickel buttons, and the well-chosen <tag "506479">shirt</> and pink tie, he looked to Clare quite like someone to be reckoned with, almost of some consequence, with actual opinions and beliefs.   

800316
Sharp dressing is history as today's smarter and wiser girl goes for the new soft option. 
Treading softly means slipping into comfy jackets, oversized <tag "506479">shirts</>, wide-legged pants and sweeping chiffon skirts.   

800317
If they win, then the race becomes wide open again. 
APART from one minor detail &dash. the colour of the <tag "506540">shirts</> &dash. the scenario for this afternoon's second Test at Elland Road is similar to that for the first.   

800318
`Bullshit." 
He took off his jacket, opened his <tag "506479">shirt</>, and moved closer to her on the bed.   

800319
But unemployment is expected to start rising again, and ministers are aware that that in itself will dent the Government's political image. 
The statement is also likely to underline the prospect of a <tag "521312-a">hairshirt</> Budget next March, intended to ensure that the worst austerity effects of the Government's anti-inflation battle are over and done with at least a year before the next election.  

800320
His face looked odd, the upper part brown, the lower part white. 
He was dressed in a crumpled brown suit with a brown <tag "506479">shirt</> and tie.   

800321
He was, and continued to do so through many ensuing years of a chequered relationship which was conducted, in true Hollywood style, with the keyhole attention of the world's media. 
They saw a great deal of each other during those months of filming Chinatown and it was apparent to Nicholson's closest friends that he was falling in love with the stylish, sophisticated lady who actually appeared his exact opposite in the way she dressed &dash. compared to his favourite mode of crumpled slacks and <tag "514748">sweatshirt</> &dash. and in her aloofness, which could be taken for snobbishness by those who did not know her.   

800322
My friends were chatting to Sean Murphy, his beady eyes and Guinness-fringed lips at a level with Rozanov's chest. 
A green <tag "506479">shirt</> beer-bulged over a low-slung belt.   

800323
The appalling bigotry remains; witness the broadcast interviews with supporters after Rangers" announcement on Monday. 
Indeed on Wednesday, at Belfast's Orange procession, a delegation from Glasgow marched in <tag "521313">T-shirts</> proclaiming `NO MOre Rangers", the capital letters spelling a sombre warning. 

800325
`Who needs Freud when there's Deirdre?" I saw Victor threading an uncertain path through the dining room. 
So he had worn scruffy jeans and a Texas University <tag "521313">T-shirt</> to his Downing Street breakfast.   

800326
Violence and shrine-making are two things I can do without. 
If one wanted to be portentous, there was and is a hint of surrogate fascism about the entire international cult of the game: organised violence, tribal and racial hatreds wilfully stimulated, mad devotion to sawdust heroes, even coloured <tag "506540">shirts</>.   

800327
She is wearing vest, pants, tights. 
`Sorry," he says, struggling out of his jacket, wrenching at his tie, tearing off his shirt. 
She picks the <tag "506479">shirt</> up from the floor and searches for its label.   

800328
Never send any cash. best cannot take responsibility for price changes. 
Children will cut a dash in these <tag "514748">sweatshirts</> made in 65% cotton, 35% polyester.  

800329
Launched upon an unsuspecting world by the Frankfurt left-wing satirical magazine Titanic, Genschman, who looks more like Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the pudgy Foreign Minister, than Michael Keaton's recent big screen Batman, has suddenly become a cult figure in West Germany. 
The Foreign Ministry and Titanic are being inundated by thousands of requests for Genschman <tag "521313">T-shirts</>, baseball caps, stickers, buttons and posters and demands to join his fan club.   

800330
Rita's winning story, Streets Ahead, features Carol Graham as the central character. 
`Her life is measured out in easy units; the number of stairs she sweeps; the number of <tag "506479">shirts</> she irons; the number of hours she works to add to the family income.   

800331
Casual clothes, too, are very similar for this type of person. 
Even the President of the United States wears an open neck <tag "506479">shirt</> and a woolley when he relaxes.   

800332
Repercussions, however, could sour relations between the Irish FA and the squad; the players feel Opel have taken a rather cavalier attitude toward the potential income of their World Cup pool. 
Sponsor problems on a different plane for Millwall, who thought they had found a lucrative deal for some corporate name-plus-logo on their <tag "506540">shirts</>.   

800333
Apart from the obvious mistake made by Y concerning a certain undercarriage selection, a further three errors surrounded the air miss itself. 
Can you spot them and to which pilot they apply? 
There's a superb FLYER <tag "514748">sweatshirt</> for the winner among the best entries sent in.  

800334
Unlike the others, he was freshly shaven and his swift-moving brown eyes were alert. 
He wore an expensive check sports jacket, a spotless white <tag "506479">shirt</>, blue tie with a regimental tie clip sporting the symbol of the airborne forces.   

800335
She stood for a moment before her tiny, packed closet. 
The lighter clothes were narrow bands of color randomly distributed in the woollier press of darker skirts and coats, forming a pattern like a spectrograph. 
She took hold of the sleeve of a striped <tag "506479">shirt</>, pulled it free, and held it here and there, against a number of dark masses, shaking her head. 

800336
He strides through the kitchen, where Marjorie is listlessly loading his soiled breakfast things in to the dishwasher, and runs up the stairs. 
Back in the en suite bathroom, he briskly cleans his teeth and brushes his hair. 
He goes into the bedroom and puts on a clean white <tag "506479">shirt</> and a suit.   

800337
An instant crowd formed, mostly children. 
Two or three pairs of hands roamed sensuously over the alloy frame, tentatively flexing the brakes and fiddling with the gear shift. 
`How much you pay for this?" asked a lad in a Michael Jackson <tag "521313">T-shirt</>, hopefully. 

800338
They will give you your tickets." 
I am beyond thought. 
My <tag "506479">shirt</> is soaked through, my head is spinning.  

800339
As far as looks are concerned, a lot of people are swayed by the media, it's so powerful. 
My niece is only little, but already she is susceptible to it, wearing <tag "521313">T-shirts</> and baseball caps.   

800340
They were standing in water that stretched almost from the mainland to the island. 
Roger suddenly began to struggle out of his wet <tag "506479">shirt</>.  

800341
Due to popular demand, here is another chance to look great in our exclusive Clothes Show casual gear. 
Comfortable and stylish, the collection includes T-shirts, sweatshirts (with or without hoods), jogging bottoms and baseball caps. 
They're made from a hardwearing cotton/polyester mix (black and white <tag "521313">T-shirts</> are all cotton) and come in black, white or grey.   

800342
Looking like a scholarly Foreign Office man he took the hard-selling American advertising world of those days aback by the very stealth of his approach. 
He dramatized the product, by imagining and scripting two human brand images of conspicuously unAmerican snob appeal: Commander Whitehead of Schweppes and `The Man In The Hathaway <tag "506479">Shirt</>". 

800343
It was eerie. 
He was wearing a black dress suit and a cream <tag "506479">shirt</> with frills that reached all the way down the front, like jonquils. 

800344
He stood wheezing contentedly in the flat evening sun. 
In his brown canvas boots, faded blue trousers, checked <tag "506479">shirt</> and frayed cap, one might have mistaken him for a man of no consequence instead of a senior member of local government.   

800345
In the next two years Elvis and the Colonel between them grossed a hundred million dollars. 
Elvis made four box office hit films in quick succession, and the inventive Colonel sold franchises for Presley <tag "521313">T-shirts</>, Presley jeans, badges and diaries, even lipsticks (`Hound Dog Orange") and toilet paper.   

800346
Mr Hegenbart, 53, is a burly man who began his working life as a locksmith, later completing a thesis on the relationship between science and ideology. 
Sitting <tag "521289">shirtsleeved</> in his modest flat, a little south of the city centre, he repeatedly stressed the need for fundamental reform of the Communist Party.   

800347
And therein lies the problem, for although Matt Groening's characters were copyrighted this year, they have already been hijacked. 
Much to Twentieth Century-Fox's consternation, authorised Bart Simpson <tag "521313">T-shirts</> (around $15) are now trailing a poor second behind unauthorised rip-offs on which the character features in all manner of contexts.   

800348
Ask for white and you'll be offered a chardonnay or sauvignon. 
Another thing the Grossmans have got right is the staff, a handsome, efficient bunch turned out in classic cotton men's <tag "506479">shirts</> of Brooks Brothers blue.   

800349
It was not a strong gust, but it was fiercely hot, and he was  severely burned all over his back and legs. 
He was wearing a <tag "506479">shirt</> and  trousers at the time; these were unmarked. 

800350
`We are delighted that our association with Brother has now been extended to at least six years and are proud that such a prestigious multi-national company have chosen to support us," said City chairman Peter Swales. 
Manchester City's players will continue to wear the Brother name on their <tag "506479">shirts</> for all matches.   

800351
and then the next day things got bad again because Parkinson was going to go in room number two to sort out his slides 
and Benguiat had been in there and evidently he had just decided to tuck his shirt in and loosen his trousers 
and while he was tucking his <tag "506479">shirt</> in Parkinson came in and {inaudible seconds=1} says aha, caught you with your pants down, 

800353
Armani lightweight suits at #400 a throw were in the window of Carl Alberti's in the centre of Bologna, but the young manageress said: `The fans, I think, are more interested in what they drink than what they wear." 
The British Bulldog has now become part of the European football fans" currency, appearing on the <tag "521313">T-shirts</> of Dutch, German and English fans alike, usually growling and spitting. 

800354
Still, if rude mechanicals did end up talking like the bard Moynihan himself, who could blame them? 
He's reet infectious, like, and often hilarious, above all in describing trips by his own club, Battersea Park AFC, to the Bronte Country and Normandy, where the tale concerns a misapprehension that Danny Blanchflower is to appear as the visitors' secret weapon: `When Battersea did call on their only substitute, a bespectacled economist, the crowd howled with disbelief. 
`He was wearing the correct No. 12 <tag "506540">shirt</>, but why on earth was he wearing cavalry twill trousers and white gym shoes? 

800355
They are now seeking to diminish his symbolic importance and to play down the perception that he is the leader of `the oppressed". 
The slogan `Long live Nelson Mandela" has all but vanished from the <tag "521313">T-shirts</>, the banners and the rhetoric at anti-apartheid rallies. 

800356
Contemptuous of his puttering colleagues, he wants to give his career a boost by playing music that will appeal to city whites. 
Lest we think this is a sell-out, though, he rips his <tag "506479">shirt</> open to reveal the scar he received as a child from the hands of the men who gang-raped his mother and later hanged and burnt his father.   

800358
I've never gone out in a monkey suit before in my life and after tonight I'm never doing it again." 
Jim Kelly ran his finger around the collar of his white dress <tag "506479">shirt</> to loosen it. 

800359

Now, what's happening in organic chemistry at the moment? 
Well, you're sitting looking very smart here in a suit, which I suspect is made out of organic fibres and the tie, which I suspect is made out or artificial organic fibres, and the <tag "506479">shirt</> looks remarkably artificial too.

After that, respect returned in the form of sufficient money for decent food and acceptable wine, for clothes that fit, making his woman look pretty again, and most important, for the doctors who made his woman feel better. 
The suit and <tag "506479">shirt</> he wore today had been dug out of a closet.

`Let's get a rowboat and go up to Byron's Pool," Bazza pulled a crumpled #5 note from his back pocket and hired a skiff without waiting for argument. 
Daniel took off his <tag "521313">T-shirt</>, lowered the oars into the water and pulled them swiftly upstream between the reedy banks of Grantchester meadows.

Marlon Brando became a star to underwear manufacturers when he greatly boosted their sales by appearing in a vest in the film `A Streetcar Named Desire". 
Clark Gable, on the other hand, caused vest sales to drop drastically when he took off his <tag "506479">shirt</> in `It Happened One Night", to reveal a completely bare torso.  

800367
Thus while Deryck Fox can celebrate his first call-up since 1986, it is only with the knowledge that he will be discarded if Gregory is passed fit. 
Those waiting to see whether Edwards or Tony Myler gets the stand-off <tag "506540">shirt</> must likewise wait a little longer, and Reilly has also prevaricated over the choice between Alan Tait and Steve Hampson at full-back, though neither player is injured.

The boy was curled against him, his legs drawn up, his hands touchingly folded, his head lying now between Michael's shoulder and the back of the seat. 
The white laundered shirt hung open almost to his waist. 
As Michael looked at him, and then returned his gaze to the road, he had a very distinct impulse to thrust his hand into the front of Toby's <tag "506479">shirt</>.

" From make-up they went to hairdressing, where an overweight blonde woman spent half an hour spraying and fingering Martha's traumatised frizz until it relaxed contentedly against her scalp in tight, gleaming curls like the fleece of a pampered lamb.

Torquay United have completed the #60,000 signing of the Dundee utility player Wes Saunders. 
THE young lad in the Manchester United supporters" shop asked yesterday: `Are there new goalies" shirts next season too?" 
`It's not new <tag "506540">shirts</> they want," said his dad, `it's a new goalie.

`The guard was formed to take part in a village carnival and I was press ganged into taking part," said Stuart. 
The members of the guard make all their own armour and equipment, including chain mail <tag "506479">shirts</> and helmets, using the same materials and methods as the Romans. 

800373
but perhaps it loses something in translation. 
The Irish fans who arrived in a crocodile for the West Germany-Holland game marching through Sieg Heiling Germans and sweetly singing `She wheeled her wheelbarrow through streets broad and narrow" also showed a bit of style, even if their green <tag "521313">T-shirts</> in man-made fibre might not have won many fashion plaudits.   

800374
The back door closed with a slam, and Frankie guessed that Nanny had left the house. 
He wondered why she had turned against him after cooking him such a nice meal and being so kind to him while Smallfry was away. 
Taking the oddly shaped metal comb from the pocket of his <tag "506479">shirt</>, he ran it through the short oily hair on top of his head.   

800376
Her legs were so skinny that they filled you with fear for her on windy days. 
Her shoulder-blades were like wings, trapped under her <tag "506479?">shirts</>, mobile, fluent, fighting their restraint.

He ran back and saw it about to be driven off by the thief. 
The owner jumped into the car and yanked on the handbrake to stop the car while the driver leapt out and ran off. 
He is around 20, with short fair hair, black shorts and a white T <tag "521313">shirt</>.   

800379
He could feel the hotness of inflamed flesh and the steady throbbing of a dozen tooth-sized bruises. 
His father's smell seemed to be impregnated in the large cotton <tag "506479">shirt</> that covered him from neck to calf.   

800380
The kicks had left it dark and puffy and it throbbed without pause. 
Only in the relative security of the shed did he dare strip off the jacket and <tag "506479">shirt</> and examine it. 

800381
The well-rigged facades are here rendered as ultimate gawdiness, a mockery of artifice rather than an example of it. 
The play, a metropolitan satire upon jaded sexual manners, reliant upon Jonsonian humours and borrowed characters from Wycherley, arranges a complex array of intrigues, disguises and masking. 
It exudes a mood of sexual langour and satiety, the young men changing girls as regularly as their <tag "506479">shirts</>, the girls as enthusiastically astride the sexual merry-go-round as the various men are them. 

800382
The tank stops, the gun turns away.

Alright, what you didn't see, and I've talked to the man who made the video, and he tells me that in fact &dash. as played in slow motion, it does definitely show that Martin Foyle as the ball was going goalward, got the final touch to the ball and did put it into the net, no doubt that in fact it was Foyle's goal. 
So Foyle retains the number four <tag "506540">shirt</> for next week?

There was always a Full Supporting programme; and we thrilled to The March of Time (I am actually singing the theme music as I write), with a long queue of people going right round the world. 
I was always put in mind of Mrs Dooley's observation that if every Chinaman ordered an extra half inch to the tail of his <tag "506479">shirt</>, it would keep the mills of Lancashire in work for a long time.

Eventually his struggle for civil liberties led him into the CCF.

Try putting a little badge on the front of a top and placing it face down. 
The badge is secret &dash. and no-one should know that it's hiding on the front until she gets the <tag "521313">T-shirt</> or jumper on.

On his right arm were tattoos of a bird and a face, or skull. 
He was wearing a blue V-neck jumper with a red, blue and green pattern across the chest and a pale blue <tag "506479">shirt</>. 

800391
He dressed with great care. 
He had refused to buy any new clothes for the wedding but the brown suit had been brushed and pressed. 
The white <tag "506479">shirt</> was starched and the shoes shone.

Fast guys tire, a basketball coach once said of his own high-rise team, but big guys don't shrink. 
Millwall &ellip.0 Norwich City &ellip.1 GRAFFITI displaying the legend `lesbians ignite"; <tag "521313">T-shirts</> bearing the sinister slogan `These colours do not run"; and simulated sex over the Tannoy gave every indication that Millwall was still a Den of iniquity.   

800393
This seemed an unfair judgement. 
He gave Daniel far more respect than Colin had ever done, walked around the set in a concentrated daze talking to himself, and made the costume designer angry by rejecting thirty-six <tag "506479">shirts</> as unsuitable for his character.   

800394
You might not buy a car off Big Jack, or invest your life savings in Paul McGrath, but such is the wave of World Cup euphoria from Cork to Donegal that both these organisations have been anxious to promote their product with pictures of the lads. 
But the sudden appearance around the country of 101 advertising hoardings depicting the squad wearing <tag "521313">T-shirts</> bearing the building society's name and logo contravened the deal GM thought they had struck They thought the Ir #125,000 paid in the name of Opel to the Irish FA gave them exclusive rights &dash. vorsprung durch punts, as they say in Dublin, turning the Irish Permanent campaign temporary with an injunction.

The British Bulldog has now become part of the European football fans" currency, appearing on the T-shirts of Dutch, German and English fans alike, usually growling and spitting. 
But the shirt slogan that has caused more flutters is the `Lock Up Yer Daughters" model, or `Tenete Sotto Chiave Le Vostre Figlie" as Corriere della Sera helpfully translated it. 
The favourite Dutch <tag "521313">T-shirt</> shows a Dutchman holding up the leaning tower of Pisa and saying: `Don't worry, we're coming."

It is fixed in our minds, we shall always see this scene before us. 
Some people will remember the contours of the tank more clearly; for others it will be the man in the white <tag "506479">shirt</>.

First ideas were always the best. 
He removed his jacket, trousers, <tag "506479">shirt</>, tie and underclothes and studied himself in the mirror.

Maybe he ran away in horror". 
Despite the fact that Hopkins (a baker's son from Port Talbot) was playing a choirmaster Welsher than leeks, called Dafydd Ap Llewellyn, the actor at first had problems finding a `way in" to his character. 
`I knew he was a raging fanatic, so I found a greatcoat that was too small with a button missing, the worst ties I could find, a green <tag "506479">shirt</> and a pair of suede shoes stained with Copydex.

ADAM Michnik, one of Solidarity's top advisers, spoke highly of President Mikhail Gorbachev here yesterday but laughed off speculation that he was due to meet the Soviet leader on his visit. 
On his first visit to the Soviet Union, to address an East-West seminar, the long-time Solidarity activist was given a nervous reception by the Institute of International Relations, which is connected with the Soviet Foreign Ministry. 
Although Mr Michnik, in open-neck <tag "506479">shirt</> and jeans, is a member of the Polish Parliament, there was no sign that the Soviet organisers of the seminar had been told he was a VIP who might meet Mr Gorbachev. 

800400
Loads of Russians were there walking about like English people do. 
Some were licking ice-creams, some were talking and laughing and some were sunbathing in their underwear with rouble notes on their noses to prevent sunburn. 
Indeed, such was the heat that I was forced to go back to the hotel and take off my balaclava, mother's fur hat, mittens, big overcoat, four sweaters, <tag "506479">shirt</> and two T-shirts.   

800401
It once belonged to a Canadian lumberjack who had a sweat or, more politely, a perspiration problem, at least so my mother maintains. 
The smell doesn't bother me as I am used to it, although other people have complained. 
Under the <tag "506479">shirt</> I wear an `I love Cliff Richard" T- shirt.

If Soviet factories are struggling to meet Western standards, the Soviet leader has had no such problems. 
Mikhail Gorbachev T-shirts were selling in their thousands in Italy during his recent visit to the country. 
Top British designer Katharine Hamnett produced `I Love Gorby" <tag "506479">shirts</> for her March catwalk show, and Cimarron, a Spanish company launching in the UK in January, has splashed Gorbachev's face across its winter collection.

He grew up in south London, at the Elephant &and. Castle, in a house largely given over to his father's second-hand furniture business. 
Many ornate pieces found a temporary home in the family living room, and the temporariness often had an echo in Blundy's adult life (that and his father's constant instruction: `Boy, tuck your <tag "506479">shirt</> in").

Later Ben Shermans followed other makers (Brutus, Jaytex) &and. moved the second button up to almost between the collar point buttons.

And will the sartorially-conscious supporter have to pay for a new wardrobe in which to battle the carabinieri? 
The present England <tag "506540">shirt</> costs about #24.99 for a full-sized fan, but the little number that saw us through (and its red going-away alternative) is beginning to reek from all those coach trips, nights spent in railway stations and sweaty terrace pens. 

800406
For this was a familiar story, United with 70 per cent of the play, creating openings but unable to score. 
Not that Spurs did not deserve this victory, for all that they needed only red <tag "506540">shirts</> to look like Arsenal: offside tactics, packed defence, playing for the breakaway.

It was his inspiration to claim that `At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise in this new Rolls Royce comes from the electric clock."

From long experience he knew the hangover would pass before it was time for him to stalk on stage and rebuke Hamlet for grieving overmuch for his father. 
Halfway through dressing, wearing his <tag "506479">shirt</> and underpants, he looked for Moda in the workroom, where he assumed she would have thrown it on their pile of magazines; he wanted to gaze at Bella Kropotkin again, but he couldn't find the magazine.   

800409
'And did you buy a car?" he asks. 
`No, sir] I bought a <tag "521313">T-shirt</>." 

800410
It is unfair, though, to compare their style with Wimbledon's for they are considerably more positive, Wilf Rostron and Bradshaw having fitted in smoothly. 
Barnsley, despite their concession to modernity in a garish <tag "506479">shirt</>, tried to play their customary stylish football, but found it difficult to advance against a side that can drop mortar bombs into the rear with accuracy and operate the offside trap with the efficiency of a time lock.

Several thousand people, including many wearing the blue <tag "506479">shirts</> of the official Free German Youth, were waiting to see Mr Gorbachev on his first `meet-the-people" detour of the day.   

800414
Claude Campbell was another surprise. 
She had expected to see him as urbane as ever &dash. urbane for Jamaica, at least, a tacky gold watch, one of his silk ties and the sharp, lightweight suit that was practically a uniform for young Caribbean lawyers; instead he wore washed-out jeans and a sports <tag "506540">shirt</>, and his hair, which had begun to recede prematurely at his temples, was cropped very short.   

800415
Exhausted, he sat down on one of the steps leading from the bathroom and leaned his brow against the cool wall. 
He had returned his father's <tag "506479">shirt</> and now wore his own vest, washed in the tin bath and dried over the kitchen pipes.

`Toby has been introduced already." 
Dora continued to look at Mrs Mark, noticing how her rosy face, devoid of make-up, contrived to be shiny and downy at the same time, and how exceedingly long her plait of fair hair must be when it was unrolled. 
Mrs Mark wore a blue open-necked <tag "506479">shirt</> and a brown cotton skirt above shaggy bare legs and canvas slippers.   

800418
`Gotcha." 
Standing in a speedboat beyond the reef, struggling to support his camera with its long lens, Keith Cowley fired shot after shot. 
His lurid Hawaiian <tag "506479">shirt</>, wet with spray, flapped damply in the wind.   

800419
Rose and myself are away for the day." 
`When do you think you'll be back, Daddy?" Rose had left out his brown suit and <tag "506479">shirt</> and tie and socks and he had started to dress.   

800420
He eyed the airline labels which she had not bothered to remove from her bags. 
`I'm a model, I travel all the time," she informed him, pressing a ten pound note into his hand with a gracious expression. 
Dressed for moving in grey sweatpants and a <tag "521313">T-shirt</>, she knew she did not look like anyone's idea of an international model, but money always talked to this type.   

800421
A combination of poor timing by Bath and disruption gave Moseley the first half line-outs by 17 to 10, and the kicking of Carl Arntzen kept them driving into Bath territory. 
In contrast, Bath were firing only in fits and starts in the forwards, though the industrious Victor Ubogu countered a first-blood try by Paul Daniell and Simon Halliday pounced on a gift of a fly hack by Chris Barbor to turn Bath round in front. 
In the perfect conditions they won the line-outs 15 to 9, Richard Hill put in some telling, if occasionally self-indulgent, sniping runs, and Halliday's unstoppable second try on the crash ball showed how much he wants his England <tag "506540">shirt</> back.   

800422
We decided to grab a taxi, and drove through darkening streets crowded with Saturday afternoon shoppers. 
And not shoppers alone: turning a corner, we were confronted by a mob of young men in Union Jack <tag "506479">shirts</>, their heads shaven.

One shop in Liverpool has discounted Adidas trainers in kids' size two on display but not for sale.

It's nothing to do with the thing you are looking for." 
Ludens, amazed at his own emotion, found he was kneeling on one knee. 
He stood up and shook himself, like a dog emerging He dragged at his <tag "506479">shirt</> and ruffled his hair and stamped his feet an swung his arms about. 

800425
I'm not sure one's available until tomorrow morning." 
`Sure there is, babe," interrupted the young man with small gold wings pinned crookedly on his white <tag "506479">shirt</>.

He showed me, a TV spectator sitting in an armchair who could not and dared not follow his example that, yes, there is a choice.

Piss off, Buddy. 
HAVING TRAVELLED over 150 miles each way to see Nirvana at the London Astoria last Wednesday, I was interested to see what the event would be like regarding `crusties", <tag "521313-a">T-shirt</> prices and security at the `notorious" Astoria.

Now the handful of survivors have been made an offer they cannot refuse: a last chance to surrender and march out, still beneath the banner of Modernism, straight into the arms of the museum culture &dash. not as prisoners, but as co-belligerents. 
Nowhere is the siren song of conservation more difficult to resist than when it combines a sentimental appeal to make a restoration project out of every down-at-heel relic, with the coded suggestion that it might even be a retail money-spinner in its own right if properly marketed by a curator and a press officer with a gift shop and a <tag "521313-a">T-shirt</> designer on hand.

Her severely bobbed black hair fell to her sharp jaw; scarlet lipstick gave her thin mouth the look of a crayon line in her pale face. 
At the back of the studio the photographer's two assistants busied themselves loading magazines and polishing invisible specks of dust off the lenses that fitted into the foam recesses of two silver camera cases.

Yet you also sense that he has acquired a more peaceable objectivity &dash. using the distance between himself and his company to create an increasingly transparent, increasingly classical form of dance. 
THE PALM NUT rolled into the dust next to a Coca-Cola can and a small round of applause went up for the white election official. 
In his white <tag "506479">shirt</>, neatly-ironed blue shorts and long socks, he could have been on a bowling green in Cape Town.

On the small landing at the top of the main staircase he stopped to examine his reflection in the mirror. 
Light from the bathroom filled the area with pale shadows and gave the damaged patches in the mirror an eerie silvery glow. 
Dressed in his father's <tag "506479">shirt</>, his mop of black hair savagely pruned and his skin scrubbed and glowing, he looked like a thin bewildered stranger trapped within the glass.

William Roberti, Brooks' president, speaking before last month's reopening of the refurbished New York store, said: `We will certainly have a store in the UK, but there's no definite date yet."

He insisted that members of the staff wear dinner jackets at meetings of the students' Political Economy Club. 
But one sloppy spring evening he appeared with the regulation jacket and stiff <tag "521306">shirt</> front, a black tie (not in a bow but simply hanging down at each end), and a pair of loud check grey trousers turned up at the ends to keep them out of the slush.

Where violence gave us a crucial yardstick in section 4, `harassment, alarm or distress" (any one of them being enough) gives the police open-ended room for manoeuvre in section 5.

Downing keeps a record of the goals he has scored for Old Bootleians, and the captain's log stands at more than 1,300, despite several seasons pressed into service as a centre-half. 
A local newspaper trumpeted `Downing Streak" after one scoring burst. 
The headline writer would have dearly wished he had been a No. 10, but if their <tag "506540">shirts</> had numbers Downing would have sewn up the No. 9 one long ago.

Bookham was at its best; a mass of green, very pleasing to one `that has been long in city pent" &ellip 
I opened the gate of Kirk's garden almost with stealth, and went on past the house to the vegetable garden and the little wild orchard with the pond where I had sat so often on hot Sunday afternoons, and there among the cabbages in his <tag "506479">shirt</> and Sunday trousers, sure enough, was the old man, still digging and smoking his horrible pipe &ellip   

800444
Cords, white or beige, were worn early on in small numbers but in mid'71 black / bottle green / navy straight leg Levi cords caught on in a big way. 
With or without turn-ups &dash. but short nevertheless &dash. worn with black shoes, black socks, patterned polo <tag "506479">shirts</>.   

800445
Were there no clues to what was really happening? 
Even our 12-year-old boy is there in the clippings in his Mickey Mouse <tag "506479">shirt</> with his cup of tea and his Kalashnikov rifle, scampering across page one on 25 September 1976, behind that barricade of old doors, travelling with us to page four, column three, into that grassy interior.   

800446
But not the immaculate Howard that Newman was accustomed to seeing. 
Tall, in his fifties, his plump reddish face was disfigured with a stubble of unshaven hair. 
His tie was badly knotted, his <tag "506479">shirt</> had a crumpled look &dash. everything about him suggested a man hastily summoned out of bed. 

800447
Nowhere have I seen voters displaying their allegiances as they come to the polls. 
The only political activity I have seen has been a small boy hanging flags of the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance party on the thorn bushes, apparently many miles from human habitation. 
Under the UN rules governing the election, no political activity may take place within 500 yards of the polling booths but voters, apparently by self-denying ordinance, are not wearing their party's <tag "521313">T-shirts</> or colours, so there have been none of the clashes that some predicted.   

800448
The upper rooms were silent when he finally went to his own room, but before getting into bed he pushed his wedge of broken chair-leg under the door to keep the Bogeyman out. 
HE WAS NOT ALLOWED to go to school again until Thursday morning, by which time the missing button had been replaced on the collar of his <tag "506479">shirt</> and he was wearing a pair of smart new shoes of polished black leather and knee-length grey socks with a dark red band around their tops.

As expected, many people were willing to support my sponsored `push" and I soon filled both sides of my sponsorship form. 
On collecting my <tag "521313">T-shirt</> and participant's instructions a few days before the event, I was rather alarmed to discover that we were expected to meet at Alexander Stadium at 7.45 a.m. on the Sunday morning, a time that I didn't really know existed even before my maternity leave!   

800451
How we feel about ourselves and about becoming a woman &dash. our self-image &dash. is significantly shaped by all these conflicting influences. 
The day Vonetta came to my flat to talk to me, she was wearing jeans, a white camisole top, and a <tag "506479">shirt</> tied at the waist.   

800452
This is what you did. 
Button up <tag "506479">shirt</> &and. secure tie &and. put a tiepin just above where jacket or waistcoat lapels meet. 

800453
He fell headlong into a fresh plan. 
He booked himself into the hotel, bought a <tag "506479">shirt</>, underwear and socks at a shop a few doors away and took a shower.   

800454
Therefore, I binned it. 
On Thursday there was an offer of <tag "521313">T-shirts</> from a company called Monsters Of Leadership. 

800455
The clothes were off the racks, but they were expensive racks, and after he had shown a roll of hundred-dollar bills, the purple-lipped clerk was extremely cooperative. 
A midsized suitcase of burnished leather soon held casual apparel, and Prefontaine discarded his worn-out suit, <tag "506479">shirt</> and shoes for a new outfit.   

800456
Freshers were obliged to run a gauntlet of computer software, insurance and Student Railcard salesmen and a host of banks seeking their overdrafts, before reaching the union societies' billeted in the sports hall.

Embroidered silks, old gold Fortuny-look-alike pleated scarves can change the look for evening, along with old lace, rich patterned textiles, ropes of jet or amber beads: the basic line is simple enough to take elaborate additions. 
For this silhouette has all the necessary attributes to take over the next decade &dash. it is practical, it is versatile: like its wearer, it works.

As the music powered into focus, it suddenly seemed much more than a mere backdrop for Morrissey's lyrical diatribes. 
Morrissey himself, attired in a rippled white <tag "506479">shirt</> and trilby hat, acted out the totally ridiculous spectacle which, somehow, absurdly fitted into the field of pop music.   

800461
`They were a bit of a piss-take," says John, `of the rock stars backstage at Reading with their shades and leather trousers, being really crass and pathetic. 
We just thought the <tag "521313">T-shirts</> were funny, and we had them done because we were absolutely shitting ourselves about playing." 

800462
We don't recommend you hire them. 
If you insist on doing so, wear tough full length trousers and <tag "506479">shirt</> to minimise gravel rash, and make sure your chosen insurance allows treatment for low cc scooter hire injuries &dash. ours does.

Alex McDougall, aged 21, another Trinity Hall student, wearing a blood-stained white dress <tag "506479">shirt</> which had been used to bandage another guest's foot, said: `There was glass everywhere and people screaming."

800466
`At first, we were a gimmick." 
Nothing in the association's work suggests gimmickry, except perhaps for the tea towels and <tag "514748">sweatshirts</> they tried to merchandise; it was not a success, and an organisation devoted in part to alleviating the many forms of hardship that can befall equestrian sportswomen has just #2,885 in the bank.   

800467
IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING when she called him downstairs. 
By then he was standing behind the blackout blanket in his room, a comic spread out on the window-ledge where remnants of fading sunshine fell in brassy yellow stains. 
Because the room was so cold he had pulled on his bomber jacket over his father's <tag "506479">shirt</>.   

800468
Another sort of parody-pastiche, of the `blaxploitation" pictures of the Seventies, I'm Gonna Git You Sucka (15) is built on the Airplane! model of scattershot comedy and self-reflexive jokes about film. 
John Vernon as the villain takes time out to justify why he, a respected actor, is doing a cameo in a low-rent exploitation movie; a nightclub chanteuse belting out a lousy soul version of When the Saints Come Marching In is there, someone glumly explains, because she is the director's sister (she is); a nubile girl flits by in a <tag "521313">T-shirt</> labelled `another model turned actress".   

800469
The first smile came on the faces of the criminals when I told them that I had begun by committing juvenile crimes for which I should have been sent to prison if the police had caught me &ellip

800470
The Empire crumbled. 
We had been warned often enough about The Yellow Peril, and now there was an uneasy feeling that they would want, when their junks and battleships sailed into the mouth of the Thames, much more than an extra inch on the tails of their <tag "506479">shirts</>.   

800471
Designer separates which do not date and are eminently wearable. 
The rural past provides inspiration for a lot of his clothes; a tweed jacket, drill jodhpurs and a white <tag "506479">shirt</> are very Ralph Lauren.

The 39-year-old man was drinking in the Hawk and Partridge, Bloxham, on Saturday night, when he was attacked. 
One of his assailants is about 22, 5ft 9 ins to 6ft tall, with spikey mousey hair and was wearing a white roll necked <tag "506479">shirt</> and grey jacket.   

800475
Suzie was up to her ears in Badedas at her own apartment when she heard a squeal of tyres outside. 
From the front window she saw a tasteful dark blue Mercedes parked casually across two-thirds of the pavement and a slim young woman in riding breeches and a Gucci <tag "506479">shirt</> leaning impatiently on her door-bell. 

800476
Toby was certain of being awake. 
He was amazed when people said that youth was wonderful, only one didn't realise it at the time. 
Toby did realise it at the time, was realising it now as he paced along close to the water, his <tag "506479">shirt</> wet with perspiration, feeling already the cool emanations from the lake.   

800477
The last race was another pursuit and as the wind freshened, exciting racing produced a Laser benefit with Will Gulliver and Dave Johnson being first and second.

The limping man continued down the gangway, peering ahead through the maze of strollers as if he were looking for a specific location in a hectic, crowded, unfamiliar part of town. 
He was dressed casually but neatly in a jacket and sport <tag "506479">shirt</> as though the oppressive heat had no effect on him and the jacket was somehow a requirement.   

800479
The event in Oxford's Radcliffe Square was attended by members of the student union lesbian and gay rights committee and authors Martin Sherman and Simon Watney. 
Posters, <tag "521313">T-shirts</>, buttons and a petition are to be distributed throughout the city.   

800480
But it worked. 
Eyepatches became the rage at fancy-dress parties. 
And Hathaway, `a small company of dedicated craftsmen in the little town of Waterville, Maine," said their advertisements, `who have been at it, man and boy, for 114 years", sold out their stock of <tag "506479">shirts</> within a week of the first eyepatch appearing in The New Yorker.

To be sure of getting a decent chunk of wall &dash. pieces with evidence of graffiti are the most desirable, although there was also keen interest in the concrete foundations &dash. you need to take a hammer. 
The West Berlin souvenir stalls have not been slow to cash in on events: less than a fortnight after the Wall began to crumble, celebratory <tag "521313">T-shirts</> are on sale from #4 each.   

800486
She looked as if she might explode at any moment. 
Smallfry was smiling sweetly as she reached for Frankie's sleeve and eased him in the direction of the door. 
Beneath the fabric of his borrowed <tag "506479">shirt</>, her fingers trapped and twisted his skin in a burning pinch that told him she intended to deal with him later. 

800487
He was buried under subversive literature between the Gardening Society (whose president sat framed by snaps of himself communing with plants) and the Women's Group, unhappily eyeing the occupant of the Rocky Horror Society stand, who, dressed in regulation suspenders and holed stockings, was doing roaring business. 
Dressing up was a constant theme: soldiers in the outdoor adventurists' room (which also housed the Scout and Guide Association), men in deer-stalkers behind the Sherlock Holmes counter and countless Arthurian knights, Gilbert and Sullivan pirates and American footballers. 
Two men with cans of Guinness strapped to their baseball caps wore yellow <tag "521313">T-shirts</> emblazoned with the logo of the Leprechaun Society.   

800488
Dora shivered. 
She was undressed now and had pulled Paul's <tag "506479">shirt</> over her head.   

800489
Down the corridor is James Elles (Oxford and Bucks). 
He too wears the obligatory striped <tag "506479">shirt</> of the Euro-MP, and a concerned air.   

800490
He got rid of the clasp-knife that he used to boast he could open quicker than a flick-knife. 
He got rid of the stone-washed jeans, blue and white striped <tag "521313">T-shirt</> and blue sneakers that he was seen wearing on the journey to Scotland.   

800491
Like U2 before them, the Flowers chose to remain in Dublin, homeboys and heroes to a younger generation who seem to have adopted their outre nouveau hippy image. 
Long flowing locks and pony tails spouted out under broad brimmed gypsy hats, colourful patterned <tag "506479">shirts</> billowed out under velvet waistcoats as baggy strides and the occasional Mexican poncho began to displace the ubiquitous utilitarian uniform of black denim and DMs.   

800493
But how to deal with it and encourage loyalty, impose discipline upon the people of the future notional Christian state? 
On 16 December 1936, the French-language Lebanese newspaper L'Orient did a most unusual thing; it abandoned its normal, sober typographical layout and printed instead across the top of its front page a seven-column photograph of hundreds of young men in well-creased <tag "506540">shirts</> and trousers standing in lines across a field in the rural Beirut suburb of Ein al-Rumaneh.   

800494
OK, maybe it seems harsh, but I don't think I'm the only one who gets slightly bugged by dropouts trying to make me feel like I'm insensitive and uncaring if I don't pay for their drink. 
The inside was crusty-free and the T-shirts were #7, which seems quite reasonable. 
My Nirvana <tag "506479">shirt</> seems to be well enough made.   

800495
I decide to give the outfit a trial run on Anglia TV's Crossquestion.

Phoebe's new lover will take her away to his own house, high and white, where she will be waited on by servants, all immaculately uniformed and universally charming, who will cater to her every whim and bring her breakfast in bed. 
Phoebe's lover will encourage her not to sleep in a faded <tag "521313">T-shirt</> but to splash out on a silk neglige&acute.e, afroth with Belgian lace and pink ribbons, such as she has never dared to buy.

Still, the Whitehaven supporters can draw comfort from the fact that their fate is shared by an altogether less established operation. 
The dwindling numbers in the City have done for Shirt Rack, the niche retailer. 
According to Philip Monjack, the receiver, there were problems with the `supply and quality of <tag "506479">shirts</> made overseas".

For some months we did all right. 
He cooked and I told him what it was all about, and then on Christmas Day, Mrs Mouse turned up suddenly with a lot of daft presents &dash. paint for Palakuki, <tag "506479">shirts</>, suits and so forth for me &dash. and then she burst into tears and cried: `I want a friend, I want a friend."

My grandfather wore it at Epsom and won half-a-crown on a horse (whatever half-a-crown is). 
My <tag "506479">shirt</> is proudly, indeed unashamedly, from a CND rummage sale. 

800507
Kylie has never disguised her contempt at being sniped at  by critics who dismiss her talents as an actress and as a  singer. 
She still resents being called `The Singing Budgie", the `I  Hate Kylie Minogue" <tag "521313">T-shirts</> and Melbourne radio stations who  played a song called `I Should Be So Yucky." 

800508

Her forearms and much of her long legs were bare, visible, pale as her face. 
Jack, burly, untidy beside her, even taller, was wearing white trousers, a little smudged, and an apple-green <tag "506479">shirt</> carelessly undone. 

800511
`She likes it," I would say, but I didn't do it very often. 
After I had cut down my time at work to two days a week and had really bonded with the Bug, I grew bold one afternoon, stunned at the perfect love-inspiring beauty of her round glowing face as she lay on the changing table studying a small superball she held in her hands, after I had wiped her captivating little coffee bean of a pudendum and put on a new diaper, the air filled with the fresh sound of crinkly plastic as she kicked experimentally, and after I had rolled up the old gel-puffed diaper into a tight hoagie and secured it with its own adhesive tabs: I bent low toward her face, filling her vision with a pretend-amazed expression, and deliberately tasted, or rather touched my tongue tip to the perimeter of, one of her nostril openings. 
She pushed me away uninterestedly, staring in complete concentration at the swirling blue and red injections in the amber-colored superball (originally a stocking-stuffer from me to Patty, but like many of the toys we had once given to each other, now finding a secondary life as a Bug-diversion), but for me the sensation marked a new stage of love for her, as when a cat touches your hand with its nose and jumps back at the static and yet is willing to try to sniff you again, or when one time in college Patty got out of my dorm bed with only a dark blue <tag "521313">T-shirt</> on and discovered a dime stuck to her bottom, because we had been sleeping all night in change that had poured at some stage of arousal from my pants pockets the night before, and said sleepily, without puzzlement, `Dime on my bottom," and put it on my desk, and I had used it as a bookmark for several years after that, erasing a stripe in it to single it out. 

800512
He was aware of Marcus watching the work of transformation. 
Avoiding Marcus's eye, Ludens saw his own face, his dark hair unkempt, his <tag "506479">shirt</> awry, his lips patted in a grimace of nervous solicitude. 

800513
It only seemed to function in close proximity to his wife. 
Maybe Elinor, who had always seemed to know where his tie, socks, <tag "506479">shirt</> or clean trousers were located, had begun to usurp other functions of his brain. 

800514
More commonly, the originally blonde Bart is recast and recoloured as a black dude. 
Without moving from Times Square last week, for just $4.99 we were able to buy a `Black Bart" <tag "521313">T-shirt</>.   

800515
He wondered if perhaps he was dreaming and whether, when he applied his eye to the spyhole, he would see Robyn Penrose, with the robes of a classical goddess slipping from her marbly limbs, glaring indignantly back at him. 
What he actually saw, by the dim illumination of the security light, was Brian Everthorpe copulating with Shirley on the reception lobby sofa. 
He couldn't see Everthorpe's face, and the broad bum going up and down like a piston under his <tag "521306">shirt</> tails between Shirley's splayed legs could have belonged to anyone, but he recognized the sideboards and the bald spot on the top of his head.   

800516
Mr Cochrane borrowed #8,000 as the first instalment on a refurbished Canon copier, the full price of which was #18,000, including VAT. 
Canon gave him some of the special paper, which improved the quality of <tag "521313">T-shirts</> to such an extent that he moved premises and raised his rent from #200 a quarter to #480 a month.   

800517
Throughout the past year, photographic spreads in fashion magazines have lavished adoring attention on the models themselves, some with little thought to promoting what they are wearing. 
Sometimes they pose in their own clothes &dash. usually jeans and <tag "521313">T-shirts</> &dash. looking `natural", putting over the subliminal message that relaxed individuality matters more than an unhealthy obsession with fashion.   

800518
They see themselves as missionary shock troops, unashamedly harnessing showbiz to the salvation message. 
`God Made You To Win" is the message on their <tag "521313">T-shirts</>.   

800519
But lack of expertise and a thawing rink meant that they were forced to subdue their `toilettes" until they were more proficient in the sport." 
As the life advances, Tennant does less and less and the story is memorable chiefly for a series of superb visual entrances by its subject: 1929, fancy-dress in Palermo; Stephen describes the outfit himself: ` &ellip. black trousers that seem glued to every fissure and ripple of thigh and bottom and an ineffably limp <tag "506479">shirt</> of creamy stain like ultra, ultra Devonshire cream mixed with mother-of-pearl." 

800520
She had never seen a more villainous looking individual in her life. 
He wore a cloth cap, dirty old moleskin jacket and leggings and a collarless <tag "506479">shirt</>.

800522
Marcus said, `Don't worry, I will come back, I have to rest now." 
After that he turned away from the bed, picked up his jacket which Irina had dropped on the floor, began to put it on, then realising he had no <tag "506479">shirt</> on, dropped the jacket, found the shirt and put that on.

Loosen tie &and. undo top button of <tag "506479">shirt</> so that shirt collar bows out and tie arches forward like a cup handle.   

800525
BRITAIN won the first of their two internationals against Belgium 2-1 at Nottingham last night, exacting revenge for the 6-5 defeat in the World Championship in Belgium in March. 
It was perhaps fitting that the first goal went to Tony Hand of Murrayfield Racers rather than one of the reclassified Canadian imports now eligible for a British <tag "506540">shirt</>.   

800526
Richard Bray, the English national champion who played well in the England trial without displacing any of the current team, dominated the match against John Ellis, the Welsh champion, with a flair that even his philistine delivery failed to disguise. 
With his bowl beginning its journey to the jack from the area of his <tag "521306">shirt</> cuff, the coalman from Penwithick edged ahead to lead 12-7 and then opened a 12-shot gap with a mid-match spurt on the way to a 25-13 victory.   

800527
