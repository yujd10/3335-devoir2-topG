He was disconcerted when I pointed out to him that King George VI had done precisely this with nine bills in 1939. 
My faith in the Department of Justice was somewhat <tag "504412">shaken</>.

He invited her to dinner the next day, which surprised her. 
She could not guess that he was almost <tag "504355">shaking</> as he put down the telephone. 

800003
This was met by the loudest burst of approval yet, followed by warm and sustained applause. 
I could see Mr Lewis smiling at his wine glass and <tag "504336">shaking</> his head wearily.   

800004
It must be said that a kind of basic decency in Jean Hastie does make itself discernible here. 
Worried, no doubt, by the kind of translucent quality Eliza seemed to project that evening (`She was like &dash. I can't describe it &dash. something like the sky at home before a storm," Jean told Robina Sandel) the Scots solicitor decided against pressing her case any further. 
Suggestions that a London conveyancing firm would be more suitable than herself for the drawing up of a lease brought only a violent <tag "516365">shake</> of the head and something very like tears forming in exquisitely made-up eyes.   

800005
I remember taking the train and sleeping in the glass house and that, so I tell her that's what I did. 
Then she asks me how come I got nowhere to go, but I can't figure that one out so I pretend I'm real interested in this silvery seashell she's got. 
She don't ask me again, instead she just sits on her bed and <tag "504338">shakes</> a little bottle and then she starts painting her toenails.   

800006
`Indeed not," Henry would reply. 
And the two men would <tag "504336">shake</> their heads over the inconsistent, bloody-minded civilians who swarmed through a general practitioner's surgery, deliberately misleading qualified men about the nature of their fatal diseases.   

800007
He had clearly been at the wine-box. 
He did not turn on the light but stood in the shadows, his mane of white hair <tag "504338">shaking</> this way and that.   

800008
He never, to my recollection, used a note. 
His knowledge was encyclopaedic, and he had an unsurpassed gift for opening our minds, awakening our critical faculties, <tag "504537">shaking</> us up.   

800009
All the dark elitist mutterings about `Mickey Mouse" racing with only the bookmakers benefiting, will doubtless continue, but all-weather racing is a necessary extension of our sport that deserves to succeed. 
Principally it offers extra opportunities for those lower down the scale and that can hardly be a bad thing in an industry where there is such a yawning gap between top and bottom. 
BETTING on the Cesarewitch next Saturday is likely to be <tag "504537">shaken</> up today by the news that Ray Cochrane has been booked to ride Guy Harwood's Royal Vote -three days after Harwood said the colt was a doubtful runner.   

800010
Suddenly a hand bell rang sharply and clearly from the other side. 
It rang urgently and vigorously <tag "504338">shaken</> for nearly a minute.   

800011
LOOKS thrilled to bits, doesn't he? 
Maybe Crystal Palace's Lifeline winner had no need of #1,000, or there's something unpleasant in that <tag "516772">handshake</>.   

800012
Then the horns started honking, and Naples at New Year became uproariously noisy as you might expect, though no endearing folkloristic tradition was otherwise in evidence. 
Anyway, we were too thoroughly <tag "516551">shaken</> to investigate and retired to bed.   

800013
`I feel this was meant for us. 
I should like to <tag "504537">shake</> everybody up a bit.   

800014
As party chairman, he now has to sell the policies to a deeply sceptical electorate. 
Until yesterday, Mrs Thatcher's advisers decreed that he should be forced to implement his greatest legislative triumph &dash. the Education Reform Act, the biggest <tag "516391">shake-up</> in state education for 44 years.   

800015
Moments later the paring was forgotten as Randolph Scott, flanked by a posse of brave volunteer deputies, galloped across the screen in search of the notorious Bodine Brothers from Kentucky. 
Frankie woke with a star. 
Someone was <tag "504338">shaking</> him by the shoulder as the band played `God Save the King" and everyone else in the cinema stood to attention.   

800016
They continued for some time; and then there was a subsiding sound as of a great bird settling into its nest. 
Silence followed, and was ended at last by a single soprano voice breaking into a plain song chant. 
Toby was <tag "516551">shaken</>.   

800017
`Good to see you, old boy. it's been two or three years now, hasn't it?" 
`More like four, Steve," replied Alex, <tag "504337">shaking</> hands. 

800018
Either you argue or I'm going home, understand?" 
They laughed, feeling each other's guts <tag "504355">shake</> companionably together.   

800019
Her solicitor, Mr Roger Rose, said that the car which went through the lights must have been driven by a woman who looked like Pennink. 
After the trial, Mrs Cook told the Oxford Mail: `The car was about a foot away from hitting the pushchair &dash. that is what made me so angry. 
I was very <tag "516551">shaken</>.   

800020
Licence to print money or no, things looked bleak for the powerful managing directors of the ITV companies who sit on the ITVA council. 
They faced a radical <tag "516391">shake-up</> of the system, a host of extra-terrestrial competitors, and the possibility at the time of being renamed Channel 3.   

800021
The Colonel took a day-to-day interest in the brewery, as he still does, and there were plenty of other experts inside and outside the company he could turn to for advice and support. 
Ironically, it is the same Morrell's beers which have declined in popularity in the brewery's own hostelries over the last ten years that Mr Eld is hoping will boost the company's fortunes in the next ten years. 
Following the <tag "516391">shake-up</> of the trade by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission he is expecting a much wider demand for Morrell's seven real ales and to meet it the company has taken on two extra reps and is setting up a new wholesale and distribution centre at Osney Mead.

Punjab is governed by the COP leader, Nawaz Sharif. 
However, the opposition is not giving up trying to topple Ms Bhutto, and has threatened to mount a second no confidence motion soon. 
`It will remain the objective of the COP to <tag "504412">shake</> the foundations of this corrupt, incompetent and inept government," the COP chief, Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi said.   

800024
`Of course I'll write something." l thought desperately, and wrote. 
I stood up and <tag "504337">shook</> his hand. 

800025
No, refreshing. 
In Strasburg, they have been known to lace beer with Picon, thereby ruining both drinks (as Queen Victoria reputedly did with claret and malt whisky), but still the result is not especially quenching. 
Perhaps a shimmering dry Martini cocktail (minimum dilution, stirred, not <tag "504338">shaken</>; and served straight up) looks even more refreshing, though its effect is that of a silver mallet.   

800026
It was the Doncaster Rovers manager who switched the 23-year-old from midfield to right back earlier this season, and that was the moment his career took off. 
United beat several rivals, including Bury, Wolves and Bradford City, to Robinson's signature yesterday at a cost of #150,000 with a further #50,000 after he has played 25 first team games. 
He will play the first of those tomorrow, assuming he can &dash. as expected &dash. <tag "504585">shake</> off a slight hamstring strain which kept him out of action last weekend.  

800027
Williams now runs a travel business but keeps in touch, and describes Welling as the Conference's `most improved team". 
Roy Hales, a striker like his cousin, the former Charlton player Derek Hales, has recovered from a knee injury, so Welling's manager Nicky Brigden will pick from a full-strength squad &dash. if he <tag "504585">shakes</> off flu.

In the middle league, some firms have moved, or been forced to move, from the category which they feel best suits them to another. 
However, as with the aftermath of Big Bang in the City, a <tag "516399">shake-out</> is possible. 

800029
A close friend, who actually loves her husband and doesn't mind going to bed with him, went to the South of France last summer. 
The first day, they stumbled on a topless and bottomless beach, and he was so <tag "516551">shaken</> by the sight that he was rendered quite impotent for the whole day.   

800030
Such stoutly-defended independence of character was no less typical of her off-screen conduct. 
When Warner Bros, the company with which she had signed an exclusive long-term contract, squandered her potential during the Thirties in a series of amusing but, for her, unfulfilling potboilers (eg Fashions of 1934, The Big <tag "516390-p">Shakedown</>, Jimmy the Gent, Fog over Frisco), she took the unprecedented step of departing for England, where she could continue working outside of American jurisdiction.

Banks are a good deal more cautious than six months ago and they are under a lot of pressure from regulators, but for good businesses that are sensibly priced there is a perfectly good market." 
What the Wall Street <tag "516399">shakeout</> has done is remove a few players from the front row of the LBO business.

Reilly admitted as much afterwards. 
When an Australian journalist asked, bluntly, whether that level of performance would worry his countrymen, the coach <tag "504336">shook</> his head.

It was an astute remark, more so than she knew. 
But George Watson <tag "504336">shook</> his head with an indulgent smile.

`Willkomen, bienvenue you all to the cabaret. 
The girls are beautiful, the band is beautiful, lager louts miss out. 
Yes, life is a cabaret old chum, and this one's full of Club Reps, nobs of them more than you can <tag "504353">shake</> a stick at."

A further encounter with your sister, in her present frame of mind, could be most upsetting." 
Kathleen Lavender's hand <tag "504355">shook</> gently. 

800036
Vic feels his blood pressure rising at the thought of his eldest son, who dropped out of university four months ago and has not been usefully occupied since, now swaddled in a duvet upstairs, naked except for a single gold earring, sleeping off last night's booze. 
Vic <tag "504336">shakes</> his head irritably to rid his mind of the image.   

800037
Have you been unwell?" 
`No." She blinked her eyes, then <tag "504336">shook</> her head before repeating, `No.   

800038
He has never been one to toe the establishment line. 
In the early 1980s he was sent to Zurich to run the capital market operations there of Credit Suisse and in the process managed to give the Swiss bond markets their biggest <tag "516391">shake-up</> yet.   

800039
Now, holding his blood-soaked right hand to the evening light, he found his answer. 
The hand was motionless, yet at Toulouse that hand had <tag "504355">shaken</> like a man afflicted with the palsy of St Vitus's dance.

She put her name down to speak in the great debate about the state of the English Faculty that was held in the University Senate; and in the Cambridge University Reporter 
for the 18th February, 1981, occupying a column and a half of small print, sandwiched between contributions from two of the University's most distinguished professors, you may find Robyn's impassioned plea for a radical theorization of the syllabus. 
(Robyn straightens the sheet on the bed, <tag "504338">shakes</> and spreads the duvet.

Mr Barry faces 14 drugs charges for which the maximum penalty is 26 years in jail and $1.85 million in fines. 
NIKOLINA Ivanova <tag "504336">shook</> her head sadly as elderly customers in her bare grocery shop in the village of Malka Zhelyazna asked in vain for meat and milk.

He had done months of hypothesizing himself, she did not jib at inviting him to do a little for her. 
`Supposing he got off the Fleur and came ashore, either swimming or in another boat, where would be the best place for him to land?" Rob Watson scoffed, <tag "504336">shaking</> his head.

Losing 10-2 at home to Bramley, they recovered to win 42-10. 
Batley's stand-off Simon Wilson suffered a severe neck injury in the last moments of his side's game at Whitehaven and was detained overnight in West Cumberland Hospital. 
IF re-entry to Europe was tested on footballing merit rather than fan behaviour, then a few Uefa heads might be <tag "504336?">shaking</> disapprovingly over the English credentials presented at Highbury.

The line that goes `Who's that with Jack Charlton?" seemed to apply. 
When the Republic of Ireland manager <tag "504337">shook</> hands with him, the Holy Father said: `Ah, the boss."

This was the first occasion he had been asked to say whether there was not a likeness to John Gower.

And I was told that he was going to die shortly, and that if I wished, the measures that they were using with the respirator could be removed at my request, because he was in a terminal stage; it was just a matter of time, and I really felt that I couldn't make that decision myself. 
I impressed upon the doctor to really talk with Ron, and he said he had, but that Ron didn't seem to hear what he was saying, how ill he really was; and when we hung up, I was really quite <tag "516551">shaken</>.

She was stitching the holes Rosie had managed to rip in the seat of his pants in the few seconds they were in her possession. 
She clicked her tongue and <tag "504336">shook</> her head but did not look up from her work when Buddie spoke again.

Everything in my life was beginning to route itself through the Bug. 
I carried her to her crib and zipped her up in her flame retardant incunabulum: she <tag "504336">shook</> her head twice when she felt the withdrawal of my hands under her, but she stayed asleep.

In 1965 we described the suspension as `very firm, with a distinctly Vintage harshness and lots of jolts and jars. 
Rough patches of road taken slowly caused parts of the body structure to creak and groan. 
There is no scuttle <tag "516567">shake</> nor visible signs of flexing anywhere, however, and the tublar chassis is tremendously rigid." 

800053
`Is he going to see us," he asked irritably. 
There was no response; the door closed and the men dispersed, <tag "504336">shaking</> their heads, grumbling as they made towards the elevators.   

800054
She was nuzzling around, sucking everything in sight quite indiscriminately. 
There were a few tears even the obstetrician seemed a bit overcome and kept <tag "504337">shaking</> my hand.

At the US Open at Shinnecock Hills he played the best I'd ever seen him play &dash. probably even better than he was going to in the British Open. 
We played our practice round with Jack Nicklaus and after it Jack <tag "504336">shook</> his head and said, `I've never seen a guy play so good.

We had bicycled to a youth hostel in Grasse where we were awakened one August morning by a group of soldiers tramping through our bedroom shouting that war had been declared. 
We hurried back to Antibes where the hostel mother <tag "504336">shook</> her head and said prophetically, `Nous avons (sommes) souffre&acute.s and et maintainant vous souffrirez aussi."   

800057
Lloyd George took the same line, to the annoyance of Asquith and other respectable leaders; they thought that the time had come once more to drum him out of the party. 
In the house of commons, Sir John Simon, grasping at Lloyd George's vacant place, solemnly asserted that the strike was illegal and not protected by the act of 1906. 
This opinion, which was later torn to pieces by other legal authorities, does not seem to have <tag "504410">shaken</> the general council, though it is sometimes alleged to have done so, and the government did not act upon it. 

800058
Four minutes later Darren Tilly wasted a good effort for Yate when he shot weakly at Warner after evading five tackles. 
On thirty one minutes, Dave Warner made a fine one-handed save to tip over Richard Thompson's point blank header following Martin Tilley's corner. 
Warner was in action again four minutes later; Terry Stevenson's big drop kick was picked up by Kevin Thaws, he <tag "516626">shook</> off the attentions of Mark Walton, but Warner spread himself superbly at his feet to block on the edge of the box.

Whatever else, Rupert was always determined that he would cast the longer shadow". 
PANORAMA, whose nerve has arguably been most <tag "516551">shaken</> by the BBC current affairs revolution, proved this week that it has learnt from past mistakes: programmes have to be relevant to viewers.

The new universities had always been free from clerical control. 
Oxford and Cambridge were <tag "504585">shaking</> it off.

He tried to escape from it by inviting Austen Chamberlain to join the government with the prospect of being his successor in the autumn. 
Chamberlain appreciated that his standing in the Conservative party had been for ever <tag "504412">shaken</> by the vote at the Carlton club, and refused.

Wimbledon did not see Lendl in 1982.

`But you've got a wonderful flat of your own!" Holly Chase was so taken aback it had been thirty seconds before she could find any words at all.

According to Mr Jaakko Ihamuotila, Neste's boss, the company already trades about three times more crude oil than it uses, as part of its trading and supply business &dash. so if Russian supplies dry up, Neste will not, he claims, be caught short. 
In order to increase the flexibility of its oil and oil-trading businesses, Neste recently underwent a management <tag "516391">shake-up</>, its third in five years, to bring all its oil operations into one division.

Years later, he received at the tiny chiefly island of Bau in Tailevu the newly elected Prime Minister, Dr Timoci Bavadra, and his ministerial colleagues.

Maurice's sister, Monica Ebsworth, from Challow Road, said of the pair: `They are super together, they are absolutely made for each and we are so pleased to welcome her into the family." 
I HAVE for many years been able to regard the Oxford Mail as an unbiased organ of opinion on local issues but find my faith somewhat <tag "504412">shaken</> by coverage (July 30) of the Metal Salvage scrapyard affair and the meeting at Isis School, Oxford.

A minute later, with Newcastle still scenting blood, the outcome was decided at the other end. 
Mel Sterland set off on a bold run down the wing and Ian Baird <tag "516626">shook</> off his markers to head the ball past John Burridge, who had otherwise kept goal splendidly.   

800070
The area has managed eleven Cabinet Ministers in ten years. 
If Mr Ridley finds himself the next Secretary of State, next week, that will turn the average area tenure into a calculation of weeks, not months. 
All serious industrialists, or traders, would know exactly what to make of such an endlessly <tag "504338-m">shaken</> kaleidoscope of a job on this record if it were in their own patch.

Her picture and her silk quilt had been carried down below in the chaos of last night and she did not have the energy to seek them out.

He arrived so ill-prepared after his three-day journey that he had to borrow the butler's razor. 
His hand <tag "504355">shook</> so much while shaving that he cut himself.

There was no reply.

The Chancellor's warning on inflation came as little surprise to City analysts, who have predicted an annual rate of 7.8 per cent for November.

In fact, at this early stage of their acquaintance, Watson is convinced that `the temperance and cleanliness" of Holmes's life forbid the very notion of his being addicted to drugs. 
WHAT, I wonder, did Martha Argerich say to Claudio Abbado, as he <tag "504337">shook</> his hand at the end of Ravel's G major Piano Concerto?

In Robina Sandel's opinion, the phenomena undoubtedly witnessed could be laid fair and square at the door of her niece, Tilda. 
Not necessarily known as a superstitious woman, Robina was soon talking of poltergeists; and if Dr Freud had been brought into the picture as well, he would probably have been the first to agree with Robina's other diagnosis, that Tilda's psychic state was due to her recent shock in the basement (where, it went without saying, she had left her clothes untidily herself, the mess being in no way the responsibility of the prowler or other invader) and that the state in which she now found herself was in all likelihood due to an innate guilt on the subject of untidiness, imbued in her by a mother who suffered from `Housewife's Neurosis". 
However it was looked at, Robina stressed, Tilda came up those stairs from the basement as white as a sheet and <tag "504355">shaking</>.

The symptoms are most unpleasant. 
You have a high fever, you feel sick, wretched, nauseated.

What do you do? 
If you are at all normal, you bypass the urge to throttle him, or to <tag "504338">shake</> him by the head and shout: `What's that got to do with anything?", and find yourself nodding in agreement as if he has just proved something. 

800080
`No, I don't see," he said, even more irritable. 
`Because I would have to come back &ellip. we would have to come back," she said, no longer afraid of her emotions, no longer raving about bays and bougainvillea, but reaching right down to the root of the love or the lingering love that was there, hauling him out of himself, shedding the lies and the little pretences, forsaking the wobbly balustrade that had been theirs. 
`We're getting carried away again," she said, and <tag "504336">shook</> her head solemnly to make him understand.

`What do you want?

Faith Hope and Charity (Glaube Liebe Hoffnung) is directed at the Lyric by the Austrian-born actor-director Heribert Sasse, who runs the Schiller-Theater complex in Berlin. 
Sasse is a flailing, slouching sort of fire-imp in a black leather jacket, constantly <tag "504355">shaking</> with half-corked laughter.

Three major after-shocks occurred within 90 minutes of the main shock, registering up to 5.2. 
Buildings <tag "504338">shook</> in Sacramento, 95 miles to the north-east, and tremors were felt 225 miles away in Reno, Nevada.

He saw that her back was reddened by the roughness of the rug. 
He dressed, reassuring her about his lack of callers, and watched the curve of her buttocks as she stepped into knickers, the deft way she fastened the brassie&grave.re he had found difficult to undo, the flurry of blue cotton as she <tag "504584">shook</> out her discarded dress, stepped into it, eased it up with a wriggle of her hips and did up the bodice buttons.

I then walked through a gate and into the Garden of Eden. 
I passed a woman cleaning the shutters of a holiday villa with a wet sweeping brush, then I walked down a twisting path shaded by palms and hibiscus through which could be seen the unnaturally blue sea. 
Ahead of me I saw a youth &dash. whom I took to be a young gardener pruning a bush; the leaves were <tag "504355">shaking</> and scarlet petals were falling.

A miner with his head slightly tilted as though forever listening for the creak in the pit prop, the ache in the timber, which was the faint prelude to a roof fall. 
The son bumped up and down again in the driving seat, memory <tag "504338-x">shaking</> at him, hard.

Li Lu, one of the student `commanders" in Tiananmen Square, makes an appearance in most descriptions of the terrible events of June 1989.

THE Prime Minister, Health Secretary Kenneth Clarke, and the Cabinet were all accused of a `calculated insult" to the House of Lords in their handling of the National Health Service and Community Care Bill, which is set to become law. 
Opposition peers also charged Mr Clarke with `behaving like a bully boy" in the Government's `unseemly rush" to push the measure through. 
But despite the challenges, the Lords decided not to defy the Government and voted to accept the Commons decisions on the bill, which aims to achieve a wide-ranging <tag "516391">shake-up</> of the health service.

If you have anything for do with a boy now, you will get pregnant." 
Hyacinth <tag "504355">shook</> with a new thrill of fear, and her mother's tone softened.

At least that's what I'm hoping, praying for" `The water's rising down below," Bryce said to Lawler. 
At which point there was a massive crash which <tag "504338">shook</> the entire building.

Even so an organist friend of Arnold's had once told her she had a very good ear `for pitch" as he had put it. 
Arnold would never have called himself more than a very moderately talented amateur musician, but he had played quite a lot when they were first married and with some quite good people, and yet just now and then he would produce an amazingly flat or, more often, sharp note without seeming to notice. 
When, carrying the teatray, she paused now at the alcove, she remembered taking a cup of tea out to him in the little summer-house at the end of their garden in Hertfordshire and he had been practising something by Bach, and just as she was leaving he had blown a real stinker, halfway between the right note and the one next to it, and she had looked quickly over her shoulder and caught his eye, and he had scowled at her for a second and then begun to <tag "504355">shake</> with laughter.   

800101
It was a brave project for a radio team, as television does this kind of thing so well. 
Attenborough would have been up there in seconds, <tag "504337">shaking</> the manatee's hand, showing us the whites of whatever it has in the way of eyes. 

800102
It is already time to sow next year's biennials; wall flowers, sweet williams, and double daisies should all be sown in a discreetly positioned nursery bed. 
If you don't mind variation in height and colour of your 1991 forget-me-nots, use the seed produced by this spring's bedding; <tag "504338">shake</> the plants vigorously above the seedbed.

He claimed she had instigated the intercourse by first, and without invitation, performing oral sex on him. 
He said he had only offered to use the truncheon as a sex aid but desisted when she <tag "504336">shook</> her head.

Some of the dancers began to try to dance, while others cried sssh! 
Father Bob frowned and <tag "504336">shook</> his head and the fiddle music tailed away.

Domestically, Herrhausen is credited with promoting a new more democratic management-style with less reliance on titles and academic qualifications. 
He also attempted to force through a <tag "516391">shake-up</> in bureaucratic structure of the bank.   

800106
He could scan her in this way for a long time, frowning slightly, and this always frightened her. 
Yet at the same moment she knew that this was a manifestation of love, of that untiring and relentless love that Paul went on feeling for her, and which held her resentful, fascinated, ultimately grateful. 
She looked back at him, uneasy, yet admiring the solidity of him, full to the brim with his love and his work to end the stare she went up to him and <tag "504338">shook</> him gently by the shoulders.   

800107
But at the foundations of buildings, the clay amplified it tomore than 20 per cent of gravity. 
Even buildings whose shorter periodicity put them out of the vulnerable category suffered; the lengthy <tag "504338">shaking</> made them progressively less brittle, in effect lengthening their period until they vibrated in resonance with the quake, at which point many began to collapse.   

800108
The boats are built to carry the weight of the catch &dash. just. 
Their canoe-shaped sterns are designed to ease their pull towards the gear side as the nets are hauled in, an operation which, until very recently, depended entirely upon the muscle power of the crews. 
Nearly all of them now boast hydraulic net haulers, but even so it takes considerable physical energy to <tag "516517">shake</> out the herring, for which a mechanical alternative has yet to be devised.

In came the chef from Mauritius, small, slim, Corby who was and looked about thirty, putting on his chef's cap and then tying his apron strings. 
When all these things were done he <tag "504337">shook</> hands with Luke.

But the Audit Commission focuses on the training of recruits at local force level. 
The Home Office has also promised a <tag "516391">shake-up</> of the training and selection of senior police officers, but rejected MPs' calls for a central pool for appointments to the highest ranks.

These races will be held at Henley on Sunday afternoon. 
THE Queen welcomed President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia to Britain today with a broad smile, a handshake and a ceremonial Guard of Honour at Buckingham Palace. 
The jailed playwright turned politician, on a three-day official visit, gave a brief bow each to the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh and then, after the <tag "516772">handshakes</> wiped his hand nervously on his jacket.

The man's looking at me with a question on his face. 
`You can get a night bus to Paddington, but &dash. " he <tag "504336">shakes</> his head, 'if it's a hostel, it'll be shut now anyway."

His feeling was encapsulated in the image of a man whose leisurely swim across a gentle river was transformed into a struggle with a whirlpool. 
Gower sensed the dangers dragging him closer to disaster, every effort he made to <tag "504585">shake</> them off induced greater hazard.   

800116
It is so wonderful to see you." 
His hands were <tag "504355">shaking</> and she held them tight.

Today anyone who fails to see the hollowness of even those forms of Marxism which present a human face to the world, is either a bigot or a fool. 
For myself, I regret that it took me so long to realise that such ideas were impeding rather than advancing my quest for truth. 
No one who is now <tag "504585">shaking</> off, or pulling out, the weeds of Marxism can claim any originality.

He stood at the door of the bathroom, visualizing this most familiar of her rituals. 
Her left arm by her side, her right elbow out at an angle and her forearm <tag "504355">shaking</> like a pneumatic drill.

Did she call you?" 
Their mother <tag "504336">shook</> her head.

Europe remains at the heart of Mrs Thatcher's deepest crisis. 
The Pound will come under renewed pressure today as international dealers continue to react nervously to last night's dramatic <tag "516391">shake-up</> at the Treasury.

Both of them noticed with shock how alarmingly thin she was, frail to the point of vanishing. 
She was <tag "504355">shaking</> all over but seemed miraculously free from serious injury.

After descriptions of the country, which is four-fifths the size of England with a population of only 9m, Mr Ash devotes separate sections of his book to shopping, food and drink, accommodation, entertainment, the weather, and local customs. 
There is an amazingly favourable rate of exchange for the Western tourist, a friendly population and a wonderful climate. 
A word of warning though &dash. a <tag "516365">shake</> of the head can mean `yes" and a nod, `no".   

800124
Here we are shown the look of amazement on Jean Hastie's face. 
She must ask further &dash. she has seen this unworthy recipient of Eliza Jekyll's charity in a light which, surely, Eliza should be told about: she mentions the visit to the betting shop, the children's allowances gambled away. 
Eliza, misty-eyed, <tag "504336">shakes</> her head.

If MacArthur had acted as if he thought he was Napoleon, John Foster Dulles, a bleak, remote and charmless human being, acted as if he was, at least, another St Paul. 
Dulles' message was exactly what a badly <tag "516551">shaken</> nation wanted to hear &dash. God was, after all, on their side.

A good source of information on almost anything is the Mount Hagen coffee shop, run by Maggie Wilson. 
It is a mixture of highlands and Western culture, serving deliciously brewed highlands coffee, milk <tag "516520">shakes</>, sandwiches, scones and banana cake.

Somehow a building has to `track" the ground, to follow it. 
The <tag "516365">shake</> table always moves back to zero."

He refused, and they attacked him. 
Mr Marsh, 22, recovering with cracked ribs, a bruised eye and knee at his home in Moorbank, Blackbird Leys, said the attack had <tag "504410">shaken</> him but he wanted to get back to work as soon as possible.

Among the first of those missing in the body but there in word was piers. 
`Charming fellow, that," said Freddie, <tag "504336">shaking</> his head in whole-hearted appreciation.

It's very weird to see yourself; looking in the mirror is not the same thing as seeing yourself three-dimensionally, which is very, very peculiar," says Howard, who politely declined the chance to take his effigy home at the end of filming. 
By some accounts, both his and Gambon's agent found the script pornographic, and audiences at early screenings were repulsed by the brutality (although the film opens today to piquant reviews). 
`I was profoundly unnerved when I read the screenplay; quite <tag "504355">shaking</> with fear and disturbance. 

800133
They went into a long huddle and if Akram was riding to orders, Imran presumably said: `I know you haven't faced a ball yet, but I'd like you to hit it into the 15th tier of the stand." 
Richards <tag "504337">shook</> hands with Akram while the ball was still rising somewhere in the East which, even if losing a tournament like this is hardly a case for putting your head into an oven, was a nice note on which to end.   

800134
Already the young landscape gardener, Carol Hill, was shifting restlessly in the upright chair next to Jean Hastie's and Frances Crane's armchairs. 
Jean herself, catching the look in the gardener's eye, was <tag "504336">shaking</> her head vehemently.

The stylistic dilemma is lack of direction, but on the business side, there's one hard fact everyone has accepted. 
Paris is now the undisputed capital of European fashion and every designer who wants to survive the <tag "516399">shake-out</> of the coming two years must establish a presence here.   

800136
`And you will do harm by cruelly acting upon suspicion and rumour." 
Dorothea put down the telephone and sat on the chair, stroking and stroking the cat nervously, and <tag "504355">shaking</> with anger and distress, because she had not been able to say, clearly and concisely, what needed to be said to Alida Thorne &dash. who herself, Dorothea reflected, had recently behaved in a hysterical and unbalanced manner.

He was sitting down, his arms spread and his body slumped across the table. 
Wexford shook him roughly and jerked his head back. 
Their eyes met and for a moment Wexford still held on to the electrician's coat collar, <tag "504338">shaking</> it as might a man who has brought a destructive dog under control.

`Did she say anything?"

But she reaches the campus without incident. 
Passing the Wilcoxes' house in Avondale Road, glimpsing a hand, perhaps Marjorie's, <tag "504338">shaking</> a duster from an upstairs window, she wonders idly why Vic was called away so suddenly from the University the day before, and why he did not return. 

800141
They hopped on a plane to be there and do some unashamed politicking and glad-handing. 
He'd still <tag "504337">shake</> anyone's hand, and give any woman a continental kiss, left, right, left, and then smile innocently when they handed him the award.

The principle is much the same as used in bridges and has probably saved many hundreds of lifes in the past 24 hours. 
All buildings taller than 65 feet are subjected, under the Californian Code, to what is called `dynamic analysis". 
In other words, tall buildings have all been designed so that they will <tag "504338">shake</> without toppling.

Changing the ground rules has angered investors on both sides of the Atlantic, and Mr Skinner's mandate for this is being widely questioned &dash. particularly as foreign carriers are already represented on US airline boards. 
British Department of Transport officials have expressed concern about the probable restrictions and urged `an open and free investment climate". 
The irony of Mr Skinner's re-regulation of the airline industry, say Wall Street analysts, is that it comes after the <tag "516399">shake-out</> among domestic carriers has taken place and serves only to reinforce the advantages enjoyed by the surviving majors. 

800146
`The market makers will try to get stock lower before the public can sell.

Wantage Freemasons are breaking the veil of secrecy about their society to hold an open day at the Masonic Lodge, Herbert Street. 
The aim is to let people, including women, know all about the organisation and that it is not just about funny <tag "516772">handshakes</>.

Ministers themselves were only halfconvinced by it.

Evening after evening passed by without Annie the postmistress finding a letter for him in the grey bag the mail van brought in.

It is an issue which has produced more controversy and publicity than the Government can have wished. 
The proposals have united Britain's conservation bodies in an unprecedented fashion and caused an outcry which has <tag "504410">shaken</> Whitehall.

The assault on Argumenty i Fakty was warning to the ultra-liberals. 
The <tag "516391">shake-up</> at Pravda, a few weeks after a poisonous, ignominious attack on the radical populist Boris Yeltsin, was signal that the spiteful conservatism in which it has lately specialised will not be tolerated either.

Evans, the butler, a small man with bowed legs and a brisk, rolling walk, served their first meal in the dining room that evening. 
`Well," Pamela <tag "504584">shook</> out her napkin with an air of achievement.

His property holdings are mainly suburban shopping centres, and his long-term plan was to `anchor" malls in Europe and Japan with his new department stores. 
The failure of Mr Campeau's dream seems unlikely to <tag "504410">shake</> the fragile junk-bond market further, where his debt, worth 57 cents on the dollar in September, is now trading at less than 10.

And this, along with a firm, well-damped ride and &dash. hooray hooray! &dash. properly shaped seats, means a driving experience of vastly different character from the others. 
It's far from fast and there is some body shake over very rough roads. 
There again, I would say that top down in this country it is fast enough, and what <tag "516567">shake</> there is certainly is not accompanied by any rattles or `looseness". 

800159
And Virgin's boss says there's a great deal that has to be done to stop more deaths in the crisis zone. 
You've got a hundred &dash. a hundred degrees in the day time and you've got freezing conditions at night and literally just, people are lying, lying on the floor <tag "504355">shaking</> at night time, {vocal sound="um"} they're beginning to lose children, they haven't had an {vocal sound="um"} epidemic of disease yet, you know they're definitely going to get one, {vocal sound="um"} and then the other big problem is {vocal sound="um"} to coordinate a massive air lift, and it's going to have to be an air lift, you know as, as big as say the Berlin air lift.

`I didn't take your earrings, I swear it." 
`But you searched my room on Reichslinger's orders, didn't you?" Her mouth gaped in shock and she was obviously too <tag "516551">shaken</> even to attempt to deny it.

It was also clear at Kuala Lumpur that Mr Major was desperate to do as Mrs Thatcher wanted. 
When he was told the Prime Minister `did not think much" of the draft statement on South Africa he had hammered out with his Commonwealth colleagues, Mr Major was obviously <tag "516551">shaken</>.

Gonzales dared to sing self-written rolling blues that started off with the line `I woke up this morning" yet didn't sound dated, and dressed them up with fluid solos that could have come straight from some early Gene Vincent session. 
Then he'd move on to a slinky rock-swing passage, switching between lead and rhythm against Thomas Yearsley's walking bass, and follow through with a demented and highly experimental rapid-strum work-out.

The lines that used to form one picture now group themselves into another, so that one is presented with a quite new object &dash. making claims on one's affections! 
I hung up the phone, feeling as if I had managed at last to <tag "516517">shake</> myself free of a tangle of clinging seaweed and grateful to Daniel Korper for, albeit unknowingly, helping me come clean.   

800170
There is one not very far from here who admires me! thought Henry. 
He looked across at Elinor as she <tag "504338">shook</> the black hair away from her forehead, and he had to acknowledge that his wife was a very attractive woman.

WHEN they reported for spring training in Arizona this year, the Oakland Athletics swore one to another that someone would have to pay for the humiliation they had suffered at the hands of the Los Angeles Dodgers last October. 
That someone turned out to be the San Francisco Giants, the first team to be swept 4-0 in a World Series since the Cincinnati Reds pummelled the Yankees in 1976. 
Not even an earthquake &dash. and a 10-day suspension &dash. could <tag "504410">shake</> the A's out of their stride as they went back to Candlestick Park on Friday and won a slugfest 13-7, and then kept their nerve in the face of a belated Giants rally on Saturday to clinch the Series with a 9-6 victory.

It was a subject on which the interested parties had already said rather too much. 
James <tag "504336">shook</> his head and looked down, indicating that he would make no more speeches.

A dangerous crush followed a surge at the front of the stage and the security subsequently panicked. 
As the minutes of silence and confusion unfolded, the crush eased and a visibly <tag "516551">shaken</> band were allowed back onstage.

He said later: `I felt a vibration, as if a vehicle had come into contact with the building.

The three volcanoes concerned are about as widely scattered around the  world as possible &dash. Vesuvius in the Mediterranean, Krakatoa in Indonesia,  and Mt Pelee in the Caribbean. 
The latter two are simple destructive plate margin volcanoes, but the Plate  Tectonic setting of Vesuvius is a bit complex.

During the  month of July, many areas in Java and Sumatra were rocked both by explosive  blasts of exceptional violence, and by many minor earthquakes. 
Even this severe <tag "504338">shaking</>, however, failed to cause alarm amongst the local  people; they had by that time been living with the eruption for many weeks,  and it is remarkable just to what extent familiarity of even something as  exceptional as a volcanic eruption can breed contempt.

When they returned to the turreted stable block, Victoria was taught how to lead a pony in hand and walked it around the stable proudly. 
The pony, irritated by her slow pace, tossed its head, tore the reins from her grasp, knocked her over and trotted away with a malicious whinny and a triumphant <tag "516365">shake</> of its mane.

Mr Smith was much touched: `You don't get a lot of gratitude in my line of work." 
Sir James Goldsmith, financier Jacob Rothschild and Australian media tycoon Kerry Packer launched Britain's biggest takeover bid yesterday, a #13 billion raid on tobacco, retailing and insurance giant BAT Industries which was rejected as `destructive financial engineering".

It began with a love of children, but recently she has been making important speeches about the role of the family as a whole, and the dangers of drug abuse.

In particular, the brewing analysts rethought the implications of the exceptional item. 
They decided that Bass was being as conservative in its accounting as usual, and took Mr Prosser's hint that not all the provision would be required for the long-signalled re-organisation. 
In fact, the brewing <tag "516391">shake-up</> came to be seen as a positive factor, with some analysts arguing that it showed Mr Prosser was ready to slim the already highly efficient operations even further.

FAMILY doctors are today criticised by community health councils for being brusque, unsympathetic and often rude. 
The councils say they deal weekly with complaints by patients about their general practitioners' lack of bedside manners.

It certainly stunned Robyn. 
It seemed to her like the anus of the entire factory: a black tunnel that extruded the castings, still encased in black sand, like hot, reeking, iron turds, on to a metal grid that vibrated violently and continuously to <tag "516517">shake</> off the sand.

Lesser butlers will abandon their professional being for the private one at the least provocation. 
For such persons, being a butler is like playing some pantomime role; a small push, a slight stumble, and the fac&cedilla.ade will drop off to reveal the actor underneath. 
The great butlers are great by virtue of their ability to inhabit their professional role and inhabit it to the utmost; they will not be <tag "516669">shaken</> out by external events, however surprising, alarming or vexing.

(First Edition) WERDER BREMEN secured a vital 3-2 away victory over Napoli, in their UEFA Cup third-round, first-leg tie yesterday, when their New Zealand striker Wynton Rufer broke clear on a solo run to score the winner in the closing seconds. 
Rufer's goal halted a bold comeback by Napoli, who scored twice in the second half through their Brazilians, Alemao and Careca, after trailing 2-0. 
The Italians looked lethargic in the first half, with their captain Diego Maradona, who needed injections of painkillers to allow him to <tag "504585">shake</> off back pains that had put his appearance in doubt, failing to sparkle.

In these circumstances there are bound to be strains. 
But Francis has steered Rangers away from the perils of relegation once, and may well do it again.

ROYAL TROON, encompassed by its prevailing wind which blows from the north-west is, more than any soccer match could be, a game of two halves. 
The outward half is downwind, the course opens with three par fours all under 400 yards and, as Raymond Jacobs of the Glasgow Herald once memorably said, provides `an opening <tag "516772">handshake</> of deceptive cordiality".

Once again, it was caring for the Bug that had brought me to the verge of contemplating an admission of my frequent nose efforts to Patty. 
The Bug's nose cried out to be picked: she would develop colds and breathe great multiphonic bone-flute breaths; and because of the extreme cleanness of her nose, you could see exactly the formation that was causing all the trouble. 
At first she <tag "504336">shook</> her head as I tried to pick it, but soon she associated the freer breathing she enjoyed afterward with my attentions, and allowed me the half-second it took to thumb away the offending bit of tephra.

True life superseded and became interspersed with fictional characters just it has done so often in the past in Hollywood with life imitating art imitating life &dash. and vice versa &dash. and though occasionally unintentionally, directors have themselves blatantly, sometimes cruelly, chosen certain actors for certain roles because of their personal affiliation to the character to be portrayed. 
Given Nicholson's insistence that he did not editorialize, and simply spoke the lines, it was a strange blurring of realities that <tag "504410">shook</> him in the reaction to the film, where women activists &dash. and men who saw him as some kind of a hero &dash. clearly believed that this was a definition of the true Jack Nicholson.

It has also decided further to put its own house in order by asking the Lord Chancellor to introduce amendments to reform its complaints system.

800250
The change in the social make-up of the City owes much to the rapid financial change in the 1980s. 
There was a flood of graduates, many from Oxford, into the City in the mid-1980s, as banks and stockbrokers geared up for Big Bang and the business opportunities it presented. 
This was the mythical time of golden <tag "516773">handshakes</>, sharp suits and egos inflated in line with salaries.

Usually it was hard pressed to claim 5,000.

The European market is estimated to be worth dollars 22.6bn this year, and according to Dataquest, the potential for growth is tremendous. 
Analysts at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, who carried out a joint analysis with Dataquest, say these growth rates are `staggering" but warn of a <tag "516399">shakeout</> among the distribution and dealer companies.

This suspicion hardened into certainty in the days that followed. 
She woke on the morning appointed for her initiation into the Shadow Scheme with a heavy heart, which the weather did nothing to lighten. 
`Oh no," she groaned, pulling the bedroom curtain aside on a sky swirling with snowflakes, like a <tag "504338">shaken</> paperweight.

`Your right hand, is it not, Miss Lavender?" 
It was a frustration almost beyond bearing, not to be able to <tag "504336">shake</> her head or frown a correction or speak.

It was the only hint of emotion he showed. 
She clenched her teeth, <tag "504338">shook</> him.

For the moment at least, she had forgotten that he was a dwarf and the biggest disappointment of her life.

Another time, a few years later, my father and I were driving to my grandparents' place in New Jersey, when he turned down the radio and said, `Hey, so what are you thinking about?" 
I told him that I had been trying to reconstruct all the transitions between all the subjects (Bach on the radio, the theory of lift, the possibility of infinite-speed gearboxes, new bicycle designs that took better advantage of the thigh muscles, etc.) that we had talked about since we'd driven off at six-thirty that morning; and he said, <tag "504353">shaking</> his finger in `you've got a point there" approval, `That's good, good mental exercise &dash. you should try to do that a lot."   

800272
Can't we just turn the clock back a few weeks and forget this ever happened?" 
Even through her tears she <tag "504336">shook</> her head and then looked up at him.

She shouted, seized him roughly at the hips, and forced him to move; and when it was over she opened her eyes and with her hands held &dash. his face for a quick, grateful kiss he couldn't comprehend. 
The weak sun stood high above them.

The mood has been gloomy for some months as a tightening jobs market has hit classified advertising.

The pace is often dilatory and this, reinforced perhaps by the nineteenth-century costumes and setting, can give the proceedings an at times bizarrely Checkhovian cast. 
Arriving in Cyprus ahead of Othello, an understandably nervous Desdemona is forced to hang around on the quay and, in an effortful charade of lightheartedness, swap bawdy banter with Iago and company. 
In Nunn's way of orchestrating the scene, however, the forced merriment comes across like the willed time-killing in Three Sisters, less the whiling away of a few specific minutes than the attempt to <tag "504585">shake</> off a pervasive ennui.

That evening at home I attacked my youngest daughter. 
She was the most charming, lively and completely inoffensive little girl, then aged about five or six, and nothing she would ever do could have warranted my onslaught of brutally heavy slaps around the face and head.

Reading could not manage a single shot on goal while Rovers were limited to two efforts from David Mehew, neither of which required a save from Steve Francis.

She watched him tap, tap, tapping his spoon against his saucer, and then tap, tap, tapping his spoon against his cup. 
She observed the way his foot twitched under the table with strange flicks, as though he was trying to <tag "516517 or 504338">shake</> off something stuck to the sole of his shoe.

And occasionally their clean guitarwork bordered on a Shadows pastiche.

Then he ran lightly upstairs where a room at the back was revealed as another kitchen. 
There was a kettle, a primus stove, two beakers, a jar of instant coffee and a packet of unopened biscuits.

With a number of its more colourful entrepreneurs flat on their backs and several others being unceremoniously dragged back to terra Australis, there is more than a touch of fetid air wafting up from Down Under. 
Having suffered the ignominy of a dual downgrading of its sovereign credit rating by Moodys Investors Service and Standard and Poors, Australia Inc seems no closer to licking the problems which prompted such rigorous scrutiny &dash. mushrooming foreign debt, an over-reliance on commodities and a manufacturing sector which, despite a weak currency, remains hamstrung by the distance separating the country from potential export markets.

But now that I had the Bug to care for three days a week, I noticed that this phrase, which I had remembered only as something puzzlingly out of character, was coming to mind increasingly frequently, and seeming each time to capture more exactly the real pneumatics of the parental sensation: sometimes in looking at the Bug I felt as it I was crumpling up, hunching my shoulders, deflating like a pool-side flotation toy to be folded away for the winter &dash. the same collapsing feeling that Mal Green had induced by forcing me to play the Chiarnovsky in one breath: not the vocal hoarseness of prolonged shouting or whispering or even of talking for hours on a long car trip, but the deeper lungier expiration of blowing up a balloon (especially on an empty stomach), and transferring your pneuma to it. 
My mother, who I think loved my sister and me to the point of heart-hoarseness, taught us how to make clay coin banks by blowing up and tying balloons and then wrapping them in gray clay: we pinched the surfaces of the clay-covered balloons into guinea pigs or owls or bullfrogs (one of the teaching assistants did a nice caricatured head of my mother), but as we worked we were still able to sense the poppable resilience of the pale spheres underneath. 
And then coin slots were carefully cut and the clay banks were allowed to dry and fired to an off-white gritty color in a kiln: and our selfless balloons within were &dash. my mother taught us the word &dash. `vaporized" in thousands of degrees of heat: I <tag "504338">shook</> my heavy frog bank and heard a slight dead-light-bulb tinkle &dash. crumbs no doubt of the vanished but heroic balloon (of the bunchier, tied navel part that always tended downward when the balloon was aloft?), which had been consumed, along with our hoarse inflating breaths, in order to maintain the essential hollowness around which an animal likeness was only decoration, a hollowness I slowly filled with coins I found in the cool depths of the blue couch or under the seat of the car or on the alcove rug near the stereo albums, and then restored once again by sliding the change coin by coin out of the slot with the blade of a butter knife, as a baby-sitter showed us, in order to buy Christmas presents, and then filled up again.

It may not have been beautiful, but what it did was put Bridgend into the home half for the first time in ages. 
They improved their luck further by winning the lineout, and then the British Lions' centre, Mike Hall, with almost his first touch of the game, rifled through the Swansea defence to set up Ellis for his shock score. 
That inspired Bridgend to <tag "516626?">shake</> off the shackles of defence and produce a vastly improved performance after the interval.

One of the most effective stand-ins for orgasm is probably the Vampire scene, with its lyric merger of hard and soft, the victim's hypnotised melting into an almost narcotic shudder and slumber. 
Quite often the unseen and unsaid are cinema's secret weapons, be it the shadow of a revenant or the unstated shudder of orgasm whose reverberations make the entire film shiver and <tag "504338 or 504355">shake</>.

I even did a bit of acting myself: as the boy Shakespeare in Master Will of Stratford (put on by the Junior Drama League for the Shakespeare Tercentenary), and in a French school play, where I acted the part of a veterinary surgeon to the accompaniment of much hilarity when, though notorious for my shyness and ill-success with girls, I had to kiss the prettiest girl in the class.

Even though I believe in it passionately, I have not invoked the value of knowledge for its own sake.

Then one day she read, almost casually, a humorous exchange between Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Muller in a back number of Natural History.

With many exiles from these countries as their near neighbours, when they read about university protests they understand that free, liberal universities in the area just don't exit: the professoriate has too long been a branch of izquiergista (leftist) propaganda.

His earliest trick was to turn down the job when it was first offered because he did not like the practical arrangements: `When I discussed these issues with the Secretary of State he said: `I want you to take the job, tell us what is necessary for you to take it."

The `post-modern forcefield" &dash. as one writer has called it &dash. has wrought substantial alterations to our assumptions about the emancipatory project of `the modern". 
Some of these may not be changes for the better and deserve to be treated with some suspicion: the tendency to de-humanise the author-function; the license offered to slipshod architects of style to pinch and pastiche without mercy and the insinuation of academic jargon into criticism and production.

I started the violent <tag "516366">shakes</> when they gave me the crash helmet on the pit apron.

Mr Conroy, seeing her unattended, rushed across the room and asked her if she had had any advances from the playboy. 
<tag "504336">Shaking</> her head, she asked in turn what the man's wife had been like.   

800401
After a long time I heard Creggie say, `Is she asleep?" and Rita, `Can't you wait?" 
I was afraid to breathe. 
The <tag "504338">shaking</> was awful.   

800402
`This is my husband, Martha, his name is Denzil." 
The man <tag "504337">shook</> her hand and smiled. 

800403
TOWARDS the end of a week of stocktaking at the Stuttgart Classic, in which some of the world's leading male players have expressed mixed feelings about the way professional tennis is moving into the next decade, Boris Becker was asked to name his player of the 1980s. 
The West German <tag "504336">shook</> his head.   

800404
Her talent for publicity is acute and often unsettling. 
Possibly the only person ever to have succeeded in upstaging Margaret Thatcher in a photo-opportunity, Katharine lined up to <tag "504337">shake</> the Prime Minister's hand wearing a T-shirt declaring `58 per cent Don't Want Pershing" at a Downing Street reception in 1984.   

800405
The Dutchman had needed to win. 
Three early-season defeats away from home had started a buzz that he was on his way, even prepared for a terminal <tag "516772">handshake</>; under the somewhat defensive provisions of his contract as manager, which might have been designed by the American alimony lawyer Marvin Mitchelson, it would have cost Barcelona more than #1m.   

800406
Similar mud-slinging exercises have been tried on the Princess of Wales, but somehow the mud does not stick. 
The Princess of Wales survives attacks because she is glamorous, lovable, a devoted mother of her two boys, because children adore her and she has a natural affinity with them, and because she bravely enters fields which command respect (<tag "504337">shaking</> hands with AIDS victims for example). 

800408
The Torrent is amazing but the drive to it is quite incredible. 
We pass desolate wildernesses, mountain top reservoirs, and fields of petrified trees which look like creatures from Fantasia. 
That taxi dodges falling rocks, sudden springs of water, sheep dear and goats, <tag "504410">shaking</> foreign drivers in hire cars, and once, a car pulling a caravan.   

800409
In the first round he was partnered by Tom Kite, who shot 67, and David Graham, who had a 71. 
`Go get them tomorrow, Teddy," Kite said as they <tag "504337">shook</> hands.

street names visible which would enable her to orient herself. 
Seeing the glow of a red and yellow Shell sign ahead, she drives on and pulls into the forecourt of a self-service petrol station. 
Inside the little shop, a doleful Asian youth wearing finger mittens, walled in behind racks of cheap digital watches, ballpoint pens, sweets, and music cassettes, <tag "504336">shakes</> his head and shrugs when she asks him the name of the street.   

800411
Since then he has taken an economics degree at Washington State University and set up a thriving little business back home selling everything from tea to cement. 
Last year he took the Olympic silver medal behind his colleague, Julius Kariuki, and he will need to go faster still sometime this season to keep the world record, for he only just managed to <tag "516626">shake</> off another of his countrymen, Patrick Sang, who ran 8min 6.02sec.   

800412
Why?" 
`Well, you know, I thought &dash." De&acute.sire&acute.e <tag "504336">shook</> her curiously coiffured head and moved her arm another half-circumference round the one of his she already had hold of, at the same time really quite worryingly trying to push her other hand between his thighs several inches above the knee.   

800413
Accompanied by dogs and occasionally scanning the landscape with field glasses, they blended unobtrusively into their surroundings. 
Two of them flushed Keith Cowley out of the woodland overlooking the castle, and conducted him back to his car. 
`I can't believe this weather," Victoria <tag "504338">shook</> her hair in the wind as the vehicle bumped off the sandy track and halted in the sparse shade of a group of pine trees.   

800414
Do &ellip. do &ellip. you &ellip. hate us, Mom?" 
Her heart broke at the thought and tears spilled down her cheeks as she <tag "504336">shook</> her head.   

800415
Maggie kissed him nervously and introduced the two men. 
`You're welcome," Moran said without warmth as he <tag "504337">shook</> his hand.   

800416
The winning time, 4min 4.19sec, was a long way outside the world record of Kazankina of the Soviet Union, 3.52.47, set 10 years ago. 
PattiSue Plumer of the US, the most consistent winner over 3,000m last year, recovered from an uncertain performance with sprint power over the last 100m to <tag "516626">shake</> off Viorica Ghican and Lynn Jennings in a rough ride of a race.   

800417
All right?" 
I <tag "504336">shook</> my head dumbly, starting to redden where the cow pat had landed.   

800419
Have you any ladies' cigarettes?" 
`Ladies' cigarettes?" She swallowed before <tag "504336">shaking</> her head, saying, `I &ellip

You have left it a little late if you were planning a ballet treat but there are some tickets remaining for English National Ballet's The Nutcracker and for the Royal Ballet's Cinderella (see listings below). 
Royal Festival Hall SE1 (928 8800) English National Ballet traditional Christmas season of The Nutcracker. 
More dancing sweets than you can <tag "504353">shake</> a stick at (if that's your idea of a good time).

At the police headquarters she was shown into an interview room where a thickset blond man rose to his feet as she entered. 
She felt her face split into the widest possible smile as she <tag "504337">shook</> hands with Inspector Henshaw.   

800423
Bobbing up and down he was like a monkey on a stick." 
He sighed and <tag "504336">shook</> his head.   

800424
But he was allowed to return home. 
Within three weeks he was dead &dash. his skull had multiple fractures which totalled 10 inches in length; he had extensive bleeding in both eyes, consistent with a severe <tag "504338">shaking</> and possibly a finger or thumb pushed into them; his gum was torn, either by his upper lip being pulled or something being rammed into his mouth and both his arms had been forcibly snapped above the wrists, John Bevan, for the prosecution, said.   

800425
A sensible choice as a young girl's role model, she appears to be so attainable; nothing particularly talented, beautiful or clever about her, just a pleasant-looking girl-next-door who won the pools when she met Stock, Aitken and Waterman. 
In her second album, which takes a sensibly modest manifesto for its title, the mix is as before; you will hear all the tracks over the next few months if you follow the charts. 
The songs exhibit change of pace, from disco <tag "516365">shake</> to waltz, but it is difficult to marry the lyrics to the rhythm at which they are sung.   

800426
`Well, this is a paper on resources for the next meeting of Principals and Deans. 
`At present, resources are allocated to each Department for separate heads of expenditure without the possibility of virement."" Robyn <tag "504336">shook</> her head.   

800427
If Mr Dear is appointed it might be a way of achieving that aim since he will command respect from all sides and is unlikely to view the job as an early retirement. 
The Home Office confirmed that a <tag "516391">shake-up</> of personnel for the inspectorate was under way.   

800428
MPs voted by 312 to 238 (Government majority 74) to remove plans to `ring-fence" new funds to be paid to local authorities to finance the care in the community scheme. 
The rebellion fizzled out after the Health Secretary, Kenneth Clarke, promised a new specific grant for voluntary bodies involved in preventing and treating drug and alcohol abuse. 
Last night's vote means the National Health Service and Community Care Bill, which encompasses the Government's plans for a radical <tag "516391">shake-up</> of the NHS, has passed its final parliamentary hurdle.   

800429
Field Marshal Rommel's conference? 
Plans for the Atlantic Wall?" 
He <tag "504336">shook</> his head.   

800430
`Deal." 
They <tag "504337">shook</> hands on it as the child grinned, and Oliver turned off the light.   

800431
The knowledge that this cool, impeccable fac&cedilla.ade of Britishness concealed a woman whose lack of principle had led her to endanger the life of the man they all loved, filled her with fury. 
Acting the scene was a strain she was afraid she would be unable to bear; all she wanted to do was to lay hands on Victoria and <tag "504410">shake</> her into recognition of her crime.   

800432
The news of the arrival at the hospital was greeted with joy and excitement. 
They were invited inside, seated on upturned wooden crates and given mint tea and fruit, while neighbours crowded into the tiny building to share the celebration and children were dispatched to borrow glasses. 
Richard found his hand <tag "504337">shaken</> and kissed repeatedly.   

800433
She don't make no noise, but I know she's crying. 
She's sort of <tag "504355">shaking</> like you do when you laugh.   

800434
`Oh, no! 
" Eleanor Thorne <tag "504336">shook</> her head, laughing, for this visitor of hers understood so well.   

800435
When I got the letter, I knew how angry Isabel would be, too, and perhaps you are angry &dash. you have every right." 
Kathleen Lavender <tag "504336">shook</> her head mutely.   

800436
This being a turn-of-the-century building &dash. quite old for Australia &dash. with a wire-cage lift of a type that is almost extinct, I was convinced that the winding-machine had finally decided to give up the ghost, and that the cage was about to crash to the ground. 
Unable to stop it midway, I stood helplessly in a mild state of panic as the cage door shuddered and <tag "504338">shook</>.  

800437
All sorts of debris was scattered in profusion. 
A multitude of household effects, iron bars, timbers, glass, bricks, a chimney stack, seemed to have been <tag "504338">shaken</> by some giant hand and strewn any which way Maggie came upon a pile of massive boulders, which had been swept down off the hills.   

800438
World No 2 and double British speedway champion Simon Wigg was sensationally dropped by the Oxford management after two pointless rides in their Premiership defeat at Cradley On Saturday. 
Wigg, who has been disappointing in both home matches so far this season, looked right out of touch in his opening two rides and despite pleas from co-promoter Bernard Crapper was unable to <tag "504537">shake</> himself up for the rest of the meeting.   

800439
`Sorry, I couldn't manage a table." 
Gaily <tag "504336">shook</> his head. 

800440
The messy truth &dash. that the line between triumph and failure is paper-thin &dash. is unlikely to get a chance, not at least until the memories of Bologna fade in a few days or so. 
But we have to <tag "504336">shake</> our heads sadly as well.   

800441
I met Jean Garlon, one of their representatives, in the car park of the UIVB (Union Interprofessionel des Vins du Beaujolais). 
It was not because he was pleased to see me that he gave me such a warm, bone-crunching <tag "516772">handshake</>; it was the growers' success in resisting the negociants' demands.   

800442
Somewhere Mr Wilcox had picked up the idea that central heating dried up the glue in furniture, causing it eventually to collapse and disintegrate. 
The fact that Vic's furniture was still intact after many years in a centrally heated environment had not <tag "504412">shaken</> this conviction, and of course it could not be pointed out to Mr Wilcox that his own furniture, mostly bought from the Co-op in the nineteen-thirties, was in any case hardly worth careful preservation.   

800443
`The import surge is your fault, not ours and results from expansionist US fiscal policies," he said. 
If these comments accurately reflect popular sentiment in Japan, it is difficult to see how SII will fare any better than SDI or `Star Wars". 
A WEEK after the tumble in share prices on Wall Street the European markets seem to have <tag "504585">shaken</> off most of the panic that was rattling bourses worldwide early this week.

My fingers are froze, so I warm my hands on the cup for a bit before I try drinking. 
My hands are <tag "504355">shaking</> so much I have to sip my coffee without picking it up &dash. you know, by just sort of ducking my head and slurping it up.

I know you like Monty Python. 
Come on, come to the cinema with me, just this once." 
Victoria <tag "504336">shook</> her head.

Coventry recall Regis, but Kilcline and Peake are still injured and Billing completes a suspension. 
Liverpool v Charlton Athletic Barnes and Hansen hope to return for the leaders against bottom-placed Charlton, who hope to be at full strength, now that Pates, their central defender, has <tag "504585">shaken</> off his hamstring injury. 

800448
The debate about televisation has resurfaced at regular intervals ever since Aneurin Bevan astonished his colleagues by proposing it in 1959. 
`I know that members <tag "504336">shake</> their heads, but why should they be so shy?" he demanded.   

800449
He saw no more than four people a year, and was given three bullets a month with which to catch his food. 
Matata <tag "504336">shook</> his head again, as if we were fools.   

800451
The election result was a crucial boost to Kohl. 
His lunge towards a rapid fusion of the two states has <tag "504410">shaken</> European neighbours and earned him charges of manipulating the unity issue to ensure re-election in West Germany's December poll.   

800452
Then perhaps a little dancing. 
For those who know nothing of the quick-step, the <tag "516365-x">shake</> or the twist, there is a late night disco.   

800453
Mr Honeyford angered Bradford Muslims when, as headmaster of Drummond Middle School, he claimed white children would suffer in classes where English was regarded by the majority as a second language. 
A fierce campaign was launched against him and he was forced to resign with a #160,000 <tag "516772">handshake</>. 

800454
As I say, at Darlington Hall too, many a visiting employee would bring the latest tales of Mr Neighbours's achievements, so that I and the likes of Mr Graham would have to share the frustrating experience of hearing anecdote after anecdote relating to him. 
And most frustrating of all would be having to witness at the conclusion of each such anecdote otherwise decent employees <tag "504336">shaking</> their heads in wonder and uttering phrases like: `That Mr Neighbours, he really is the best."   

800455
Although missing their captain, Chris Gray to Scotland, they looked good in the line-out until Simon Povoas, Tom Smith and Alex Gissing gradally sneaked more and more off them. 
And up front, with Brian Moore retaining the captaincy for the day although Hodgkinson had <tag "504585">shaken</> off a suspected neck injury, they failed to dominate, conceded a penalty try for collapsing as Leicester went for the pushover, and failed to return the complement downfield.   

800456
Calder had a number of good stories about his experiences in Quebec courts. 
One was of Judge Sicotte, who, when an accused pleaded `not guilty", always looked at him severely over his glasses, <tag "504336">shook</> his head, and said sternly: `If you were not guilty, you would not be here."  

800457
`It's been a long war for you, I think." 
He <tag "504336">shook</> his head.   

800458
Which is why Merrill's withdrawal is a double-edged sword. 
On the one side it represents a major psychological blow to the market but on the other, it will mean that the leading banks left in the market will have more of the cake to share between them and the chance to improve their profitability. 
Indeed some professionals are expecting a further <tag "516399">shake-out</> in the market, particularly among the peripheral players.   

800459
`What about you?" she asked, as she put it on. 
He shrugged and <tag "504336">shook</> his head.

I'd have known long before now if he wasn't, Taft took out a packet of Camel cigarettes. 
Maggie <tag "504336">shook</> her head when he offered her one `Would you care to sit down?" he asked.   

800461
Confucianism, after so many years shaping the Chinese soul, had turned into resignation in the face of destiny, Taoism, into smug self-satisfaction, and the `listening-post" of Heaven gave dumb submission to all that came from the authorities. 
With its vital forces drained, reality ignored, and science stunted, the Chinese nation was, towards the end of the last century, at the end of its tether. 
Abruptly, a typhoon wind <tag "504338">shook</> the old China: there would be no exploitation, no inequality between people; wealth would be shared on the basis of take what you want, give what you can.   

800462
But the notes say `these suggestions were made by brokers and institutions trading in the markets concerned", in an apparent reference to their self interest. 
TSB GROUP is expected to announce thousands of job losses on Tuesday, following the main board's decision yesterday to give the green light to a proposed <tag "516391">shake-up</> at the retail bank.

This system is used whether the field is cut by scythe, cutter bar, or rotary mower. 
After cutting and initial drying of the exposed surface the swathes are turned over by hand or mechanical rake to expose the wet under-surface and to move the whole windrow onto dry ground. 
It is then <tag "516517">shaken</> out with fork or machine to aerate the hay and allow the wind to pass through it. 

800464
NOW THAT Douglas Hurd has left the Home Office, broadcasters realise how much they are going to miss him. 
Although seldom openly praised by the broadcasting establishment, as he carried out his brief of <tag "504537">shaking</> up the industry and reassembling it in a Thatcherite image, he was privately well regarded.   

800465
A CLASSROOM game that aims to teach children how to protect themselves against Aids was launched yesterday by the British Medical Association. 
`Aids and You" consists of 28 picture cards showing social and sexual activities that range from <tag "504337">shaking</> hands and sharing cutlery to sharing needles and and having unprotected intercourse.   

800466
Ian Harwood, chief UK economist at Warburg Securities, said: `I don't think anybody seriously thinks interest rates are going to rise any further." 
Financial markets are apprehensive that the trade deficit has still not turned the corner and a poor figure could <tag "504410">shake</> sterling again. 

800468
And by the way, could he now have back those two letters he had given her? 
Dora was moved but not profoundly <tag "516551">shaken</> by these communications.  

800469
State officials say this kind of destruction stretches 100 miles from Monterey in the south to San Jose. 
`Everyone is concentrating on the more visible tragedy in the big cities, but we have a devastating mess up here," said Ken Steffen, 51, `Many old people have lost homes which have been in their families for generations." 
But this is a Californian disaster: affluence and optimism have been <tag "504412">shaken</> but not destroyed.

The older man was pushing me into the car. 
Duffy was <tag "504355">shaking</> beside me.

He is not the laughing larger-than-life character you might expect to find. 
He is a small, quiet man, with a friendly smile and a firm <tag "516772">handshake</>.

I sat down. 
My mother and aunt were <tag "504355">shaking</> with laughter.

Aren't you worried, Rich?" 
He <tag "504336">shook</> his head.

A rough path crushed a way through wilderness and he took it, heading for a shed. 
This was small but sound, wooden and fairly new, more or less empty except for a lawnmower. 
John Gower <tag "516517">shook</> water from his hat, hung it on a nail, sat down on the curved metal casing of the mower, took out his green and gold notebook and wrote up Richard Crane's entry for 6 August.

`Wasn't it rather cruel?" 
`No, no!" She gave her red curls a vehement <tag "516365">shake</>.

PAL Productions would handle Kylie's  recording rights around the rest of the world. 
`I'm going to make you the new Madonna," Waterman promised  his new prodigy, but even today he <tag "504336">shakes</> his head  disbelievingly at the opportunity others missed.

He turned his attention again to Maggie. 
`How about, drink?" She <tag "504336">shook</> her head.   

800480
`The circles have totally changed my life," he says. 
`But even if someone came up to me now and said, `Look, I tricked you, it was all a big hoax", I'd like to think I'd <tag "504337">shake</> him by the hand and say: `Well done, you certainly fooled me"."

Along the Golden Mile, linked by well-chosen lights &dash. lanterns and stars approximating to diva lamps &dash. the traders are gleeful. 
In Sarina, where saris come packed with engravings of goddesses, the manager happily <tag "504584">shakes</> out deliveries from India.

He earns #10,074 a year &dash. the same as someone just qualifying. 
His wife Julie comes in and <tag "504337">shakes</> hands.

The Cherry Orchard opens with an arrival and ends with a departure. 
In between, everything is on the move &dash. and inability to respond to this by breaking out of old patterns of behaviour can be ruinous. 
Ranyevskaya's adopted daughter, played with a flurry of fretful busyness by Lesley Manville, can't <tag "504585">shake</> off her role as harassed housekeeper long enough for the man she loves to propose to her.

However widely one takes `thought", it is neither self-evident nor a fact of experience that we are always actually thinking. 
As Locke says, `every drowsy nod <tag "504412">shakes</> their [the Cartesians'] doctrine."

HAMMERSON, the international property trading and investment group yesterday disclosed several new schemes as it reported interim pre-tax profits up 50 per cent to #38.2m. 
The group, which this year <tag "504585">shook</> off a #1.6bn bid from the Dutch investment group, Rodamco, improved earnings per share from 10.52p to 15.27p for the period to 30 June.

Phoebe, her body content and her mind rested, had heard her daughter without a flicker of guilt, or envy, simply with affection. 
Would she have enjoyed him so much if she had thought the whole thing permanent? she asked herself sternly now, sitting up in bed and <tag "504585">shaking</> off the poppy and mandragora effect that thinking about that summer had on her.   

800489
Really need me." 
The television came on like a light in the sky and Fiona left to a wild outburst of applause from it, with affectionate whistles and yells. 
She went back into her flat and held her hands under the cold tap until they had almost stopped <tag "504355">shaking</>, and dropped on to her bed and started thinking about stabbing herself, not too dangerously, just enough to have to go to hospital.   

800490
The series has also underlined that the rest of the cricket world is guilty of shirking its responsibilities to the Sri Lankan cause. 
When the Sri Lankan players walked out at the Gabba in early December it was their first taste of Test cricket for 18 months. 
Yet they <tag "504412">shook</> the rather arrogant attitude which seems to permeate the Australian dressing room these days.

He looked at her as if he were about to say something important. 
`What on earth are you gaping at me like a goldfish for?" The moment passed and he <tag "504336">shook</> his head as if to clear an unwelcome memory.

`And this is Father Bob Joyce, our Father Confessor." 
The cassocked priest who had just come into the room bustled up to <tag "504337">shake</> Dora's hand.

This suggests a technical fault, rather than an act of sabotage. 
THE TROUBLE began for Mario Mejias when he met the Pope during his 1987 visit to Chile, not long after the wave of protests against military rule that <tag "504410">shook</> Santiago's poor outlying suburbs.

This cousin moved later to Sherbrooke Street, next door to the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. 
In my student days she regaled me with stories of her early youth, when there was a fence across the top of Beaver Hall Hill, and young couples used to go courting in the woods where Christ Church Cathedral now stands, and people <tag "504336">shook</> their heads over the folly of poor Henry Morgan, moving his shop from St James Street north to St Catherine.  

800495
As the London Underground becomes more dishevelled and unpredictable, so the number of suicides who throw themselves on to the track seems to increase. 
Is that becuase of a heightened awareness of the dangers of tube travel, or do statistics bear out the intuition that death by subterranean dismemberment is one of the current favourites? 
People talk about `underground" now with a funny mixture of excitement and resignation: artists, image-makers, mediacrats `n' brats <tag "504410">shaken</> by the collapse of arts funding, the drive towards mainstream art business sponsorship, the pinch of censorship, absurdities such as the proposed `impartiality" amendment to the Broadcasting Bill, the oppressive pressures of being simultaneously controversial, safe, presentable, marketable, accessible, new, glamorous and radical.   

800496
So let's go on home eh?" 
`Anything you want me to carry?" He <tag "504336">shook</> his head, and stared walking away from the boat, Maggie falling into step beside him `Is it the pictures tonight?" Charlie asked as they reached the road that ran along the top of the shore.

Instead the tailor-made system allows them to offer new products such as horse insurance and cheaper household coverage for dog owners. 
WHEN Michael and Elliot's little advertising business went bankrupt on the television series `thirtysomething" a few weeks ago, it <tag "504537">shook</> up a lot of people I know &dash. shook them up the way nineteenth-century people are supposed to have been shaken up by the deaths and marriages in Dickens.

Sind will be a vital battlefield and there are fears of ethnic violence between the Muhajirs and the Sindhis, who support the PPP. 
The loss of the MQM has severely <tag "504410">shaken</> Ms Bhutto's authority, and if she also loses Sindhi MPs from the PPP, as the opposition claims, her position will become precarious.

There was still plenty of mileage left in each subject individually, but as Hollywood had long ago discovered to its cost, changes in society can move on at such a fast pace that trendsetters can actually be overtaken by events. 
That was already beginning to happen in swinging London, where some of the high priests and priestesses of that movement were falling into receivership. 
Nicholson tried to <tag "504585">shake</> off the tag of anti-hero which he disliked so much, but he could not discharge it that easily.

On the river Blackwater in Northern Ireland, as  part of major engineering works carried out on the river and its tributaries in  1986, a huge new bridge was constructed at Caledon. 
Standing before the colossal  slab wall of the new structure, which itself was dwarfed to Lilliputian tininess  by the massive scale of both the surrounding machinery and the total operation,  which was <tag "504338">shaking</> the entire geography, let alone the ecology of the river system,  out of all recognition, you could just see, by straining your eyes hard, set like a  pin-hole in the great cliff of reinforced concrete, a lovingly constructed dipper  box: a room with a view, indeed!

It seemed incongruous to them that the sweet teenager they  knew was not only surviving life in the toughest of all  trades. but that she was also winning something of a  reputation as a tough cookie, a determined career girl  refusing to be deflected from her dreams. 
When in 1988, soon after she had left Neighbours to  devote herself full time to her music, the cookie looked like  it was beginning to crumble, many <tag "504336">shook</> their heads knowingly.

Remarkably,  Pliny slept calmly during the early part of the night, although ashes had  begun to pile up outside the house, but he eventually awoke as the  situation deteriorated. 
Pomponianus and his companions were badly worried both by the ash-fall, and  by the frequent tremors which were now <tag "504338">shaking</> the house.

The stalk of the plant uncoils as the current pushes it towards the bank, and strains almost to breaking point before the plant is swung back towards its starting point, where it has no rest before being pushed away again. 
He is reminded of certain neuras thenics, such as his Aunt Leonie, `who offer us unchangingly over the years the spectacle of bizarre habits which they believe they are on the point of <tag "504585">shaking</> off and which they always retain; caught in the ambush of their maladies and neuroses, the efforts they vainly make to escape do nothing but activate and ensure the functioning of the strange clockwork of their weird, inescapable and deadly dietetics".

It could be jotted down later and used when they sent me their draft to check and add to. 
I successfully fobbed off several attempts by lovers of literature to distract me, but then a couple, gliding up arm in arm, proved impossible to <tag "516626">shake</> off.   

800509
His voice was fading then and it was difficult for him to speak; he therefore drew his criticisms probably more than usual, but there was no question about his intent and I understood exactly what he meant. 
Finally, after several weeks of his trying to persuade me and my coming back with the same plastic informal notion, he looked at me and sighed, and said, <tag "504336">shaking</> his head, `Ah, Esherick", and then proceeded really to show me how to do it in the way I had been trying.   

800510
And as if to confirm my conclusions about the power of words, he entitled his statement: `Two thousand words." 
Among other things, that manifesto served as one of the pretexts for the invasion of our country one night by five foreign armies. 
And it is by no means fortuitous that as I write these words, the present regime in my country is being <tag "504410">shaken</> by a single page of text entitled, again, as if to illustrate what I am saying: `A few words." 

800511
`Of the 13,000 people we have handled so far this year, about 60 per cent of them come from the South. 
It wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if high interest rates are hurting companies in the South more severely."

The great City of Babylon was fallen, fallen before his fury.

Mark Preston scored his 19th try of the season and Andy Goodway his 14th. 
Barrow, languishing at the bottom of the table, <tag "504410">shook</> Wakefield Trinity when they scored 16 points in the first 25 minutes, but they soon ran out of steam, and two tries from the Wakefield captain Andy Mason brought them a 30-16 victory.

She occasionally thought of appealing to her mother, but something hardened in her; she would not go in defeat, she would not go begging, she would not offer herself up to her mother's `I told you so." 
A couple of times she found herself walking past the museum, almost hoping she would meet Rachel as though by accident, but she never went in. 
She did not want to see those sharp bones, making clear patterns in the dark rooms and see the widening eyes of her mother's colleagues as she introduced her <tag "516551">shaken</> amid shabby self.

Enter Polanski after the Nicholson telephone call, which was followed up by a firm proposal from Robert Evans who, it will be recalled, was also the backer of Rosemary's Baby and an old friend. 
Polanski's return to Hollywood was greeted by a rather mixed reception, ranging from welcoming <tag "516772">handshakes</> to sidelong glances which said, `What in hell's name is he doing back into town?"

Tomorrow they face Slough Jets, one of the two teams to beat them this season, and on Sunday they travel to league leaders Medway Bears, beaten only once this season.

If Prince Richard were to marry, he would need his mother's formal consent, and the tradition in the family was that matters of gravity were always discussed face-to-face and in private. 
The Prince paused, <tag "504336">shook</> his head like an animal bothered by gnats then turned with a resolute air.

Reading the judgment in isolation, one would not think for a moment that the Birmingham Six will ever be set free.

Analysts who say that the two have fallen out over plans considered by Mr Gunn to take the company private do not realise that Mr Gunn was voicing in public an idea that in private Mr Goldie would point out was impractical. 
The two have not turned to squabbling as B &and.

Second-hand soul, funky horns, wandering blues-style vocals, all derivative life is here. 
The band, made up of sophisticated London rich boys, never really looked happy as teen heart-throbs. 
So perhaps their disappearance was a brave bid to <tag "504585">shake</> off that old image (two years is long enough to be forgotten in teen land) and appeal to a broader church.   

800531
Fearing that she was being followed she ran in panic through the streets. 
At 7am, cold and <tag "504355">shaking</> with fright, she found herself in Kensington High Street where by chance she met a Filipino woman who took her home.

Interest in the shares was heightened after market rumours that Asher Edelman, the US arbitrageur, was finally trying to place his 8.97 per cent stake in the company, on which he is showing a #30m book loss, after abortive attempts to launch a break-up bid. 
In a <tag "516391">shake-up</> of top management Storehouse also announced that David Dworkin, former president and chief executive of US fashion retail chain Bonwit Teller, has been appointed chairman and chief executive of BHS in place of Geoff Davy who has left the company and is resigning from the main Storehouse board.

As reported in later editions of the Herald last week, the post of chief executive is to go when Mr John Neville Wood, 55, who has held the position for 16 years, retires in July.

They make the basic decisions. 
On the other hand, you can have something like the gang of four in China that creates such tensions and anxieties in the society and so many people get to feel that things have gone from bad to worse, that you get a <tag "516391">shake</> up and change in the regime.

Most now live by selling home-made jeans in front of S-Bahn (suburban railway) stations in the eastern half of Berlin. 
Those without the necessary sewing skills sell cigarettes, and all are harassed by the police who raid their pitches in the name of maintaining `order" in the streets. 
For most the only alternative is a flight home paid for by the German government and a DM3,000 `golden <tag "516773">handshake</>" they'll be forced to convert into dong (at the artificial offical rate) on arrival.

But not for nothing did he hail from the West Country of England. 
On a platform in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, during a general election, he very nearly came to blows with George Drew; and when, on 1 June 1956, during the pipeline debate, Mr Speaker Beaudoin ruled that `the House should be placed in exactly the same position as it was when I resumed the chair yesterday to submit the Chairman's ruling to the House' &dash. turning what has been called Black Friday into Thursday &dash.

The regime of the workhouse was deliberately deterrent, and at least up to the 1890s married couples would be forced to live apart within it. 
Little beyond food was provided: not even false teeth to eat with. 
Middle-class visitors entering a work-house for the first time could be deeply <tag "516551">shaken</> by the harsh indignity of the prison-like routine, the grotesque, despairing toothless faces, `the forlorn, half-dazed aspect of these battered human hulks who once were young."

Right, O.K., so the three areas of professional telephone behaviour were, when you answer the phone you give a verbal <tag "516772-x">handshake</>, by introducing yourself, finding out who is on the other end of the line, and asking them if it's convenient to talk.

But if one considers that the LDP has been staging its antique factional games while not much noticing or much caring how Japanese society was changing all around it, the judgment is eminently correct.

The honours system, through which the benefits of `good blood" were supposed to be passed down through society to humbler folk, no longer has much to do with honour, and a great deal to do with commercial flair and the right political allegiances. 
The City of London, once run by the commercial wing of the Establishment, has burst its cork like <tag "504338">shaken</> champagne, and is physically scattered, deregulated and professionally confused.

He waited outside while she went in. 
It was pleasant enough, a small, oak-panelled waiting room smelling of beeswax polish and candles, a sheaf of white lilies in a brass container by the door.

What follows over the next 80 minutes suggests to me that all cultural revolutions go through a similar process. 
Just as in Britain in the late Sixties a number of factors (the abolition of censorship, a hostility to Establishment values) led to a politicised fringe and an anti-textual performance art, so the Soviet Union's post-glasnost seems to be experiencing a similar <tag "516391">shake-up</>.  

800591
In this case, the technique was refined nicely. 
Sir Anthony, an unreconstructed Heathite and Europhile has declared his reluctant willingness to be the `stalking horse" challenger to Mrs Thatcher; and as he offered his contribution to the Commons debate on the Queen's Speech, a gaggle of Thatcherite ministerial aides were said to have planned to occupy the vacant seats around him and sit, theatrically <tag "504336">shaking</> their heads at the unwisdom of Sir Anthony's remarks, and generally suggesting that the Clwyd North West MP enjoys an unparalleled reputation for speaking through his hat.

Betjeman introduced Louis MacNeice to him with the words `He doesn't say much, but he's a great poet." 
It prompted in Lewis the immediate feeling that MacNeice was `absolutely silent and astonishingly ugly". 
He had a rooted antipathy to T. S. Eliot which, even after they had both become famous as defenders of the faith and brothers in Christ, was still hard to <tag "504585">shake</> off.

But when last did a politician make such copious use of a handsome wife? 
Taking his curtain calls after a successful speech, he drew her to him by the hand and entwined his arms with hers until she gently <tag "516517 or 504338">shook</> him off, whereupon he enjoyed his triumph for a while manfully alone, until he again resorted to his wife Glenys, going to fetch her, leading her again by the hand, and holding her by the waist.

THE COURTS and Legal Services Bill forms a vital part of the Government's overall strategy to improve access to justice, the Lord Chancellor said yesterday.

Customers are now being cheerfully advised to shop elsewhere if they cannot find their size. 
Suggestions that Next staff might like to ring around other branches as a token gesture to customers are being met with vigorous <tag "516365">shakes</> of the head.

It is true water-land. 
The straight roads, bounded on each side by dykes, are ruckled and uneven due to peat shrinkage; and if you sit on the dykeside, you can feel the whole  fenland <tag "504338">shake</> with every passing vehicle. 

800606
You are in excellent company." 
Kathleen <tag "504336">shook</> her head, as she always did now, an unconscious action to clear away these remarks of her sister, about madness and ill-health.

Benjamin's in his senior year, you have two more to go.

Just like Baum." 
Craig <tag "504336">shook</> his head.

But Huddersfield refused to let them coast. 
Craig Maskell scored his second goal, and when the 21-year-old striker helped Mike Cecere to bring the teams level even the deserted Cowshed, with its condemned roof, seemed to <tag "504355">shake</> with emotion.   

800612
Can you do anything, can you dance? 
Everyone's making dancing pictures now, you taking ballet classes or anything?" 
Jo <tag "504336">shook</> her head and stirred her shrimp salad.   

800613
I am not dying, no, I have suffered a terrible nightmare, but I am here, in my room, and the night must be far gone, it must be almost morning, I shall go downstairs and make myself a first pot of tea. 
But her legs <tag "504355">shook</> and she clutched at the bed, which seemed to recede and there was a strange, fizzing sensation in her head.   

800614
But having fun dressing up to `show off sometimes makes her anxious that people are getting the wrong idea, misinterpreting her look. 
She knows that wanting to look good, or sexy, doesn't mean she's `asking for it", but that belief was <tag "504412">shaken</> by a recent incident, and by the overprotective reaction of her brother to her when she told him about it.   

800615
This was, after all, the paper that enlisted Paul Morley, Julie Burchill and Danny Baker. 
Sounds was not far behind in either popularity or influence, and Melody Maker was at last <tag "504585">shaking</> off the `muso" tag that it had been lumbered with during the punk period.

`Nor her?" Rain said: `I believe her. 
She was <tag "516551">shaken</> when she realized it was missing.

It is clearly dead and damned. 
But, being dead, it yet speaketh; being the tool of the big interests, it stands up for the small man and the ordinary citizen, the poor and him that hath no helper. 
But the journalists, with a few honourable exceptions, possess convictions that are above and beyond being <tag "504412">shaken</> by anything so trivial as mere evidence.   

800618
The effort of her attack on the offending wrinkled mass made her slip backwards into the bow of the lavatory. 
She had desperately scrambled at the shiny sides of the toilet-bowl as she slid into the water but to no avail. 
Defending her life and being jolted and <tag "504338">shaken</> over the last few days had left her exhausted. 

800619
For that, at least, she was grateful. 
She woke to find Maresa <tag "504338">shaking</> her gently by the shoulder.

It's possible that some other minor eruptions occurred between 1681 and  1883, but if they did, there is no record of them, and all of the reports  and descriptions made by ships passing Krakatoa suggest that it was quite  dormant. 
The islands were well-known for their beauty to the passengers of the  steamships passing up and down the Straits, but few of those who leant on  their ship's rail on sultry moonlit evenings, gazing out at the serene  islands could ever have conceived that they were to be the site of some of  the most catastrophic events that the world has ever seen. 
The first intimations that the forces which had lain dormant for two  centuries would soon be unleashed came in the late 1870s, when frequent  minor earthquakes began to <tag "504338">shake</> the areas round the Sunda Straits.

I had never been more than 102mph in my life, other than with my eyes shut and rosary out at Heathrow. 
I started the violent shakes when they gave me the crash helmet on the pit apron. 
Before they crammed me, quivering, into the terrifying tube of a coffin, mechanics, machine-hands and general motoring buffs had <tag "504337">shaken</> my hand, wished me luck, and said how tremendously envious they were.

At her own funeral all her former friends from the fashion world and the entertainment world convened, and, like Mr Conroy, they were desolated, bemoaning the untimely death of someone who had been so beautiful. 
Many made mention of her veils, and how she put an arm out when introduced to people and spoke in that unique voice, and all were <tag "516551">shaken</> by the tragedy.

But it's by no means a women-only job &dash. its inventor was, after all, American chemist Earl Tupper, who discovered the famous `burping" seal which keeps food fresher for longer.

But the community has the effect on Mrs Thatcher of a repelling magnet. 
She was clearly <tag "516551">shaken</> by Mr Bush's remarks, and however integrationist she says she is in theory, in practice her idea of the future development of the EC clearly diverges both from the American President's, and from the other members.

Base isolation, though, has its doubters.

In the light of changes made by the Bill's architect, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, to his original Green Paper plans, a re-run of the outright and outspoken opposition in a Lords' debate last April is unlikely. 
But critics of a central plank of the planned <tag "516391">shake-up</> of the legal profession &dash. opening up rights of audience in the higher courts to solicitors &dash. are expected to reflect barristers' consternation over crucial clauses at the heart of the Bill.

But the Prime Minister made it clear yesterday that, in a quite different sense, she was no longer `fully, fully, fully" behind her Chancellor. 
When Peter Thorneycroft resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1958, Cabinet papers reveal the government was <tag "504410">shaken</> to the core, despite the description of the episode by the Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, as `a little local difficulty".

This is not the Sir Andrew Aguecheek one has grown accustomed to, nor one that makes good sense of his lines, but he is typical of the insensitive and superficial interpretation that mars this show.

They were not hard to spot since most of them turned up in uniform. 
Nothing unusual, just the everyday attire of their heroes: bright red capes, shiny space boots, the odd ray-gun, and of course those tight-fitting velours jumpers.

After World War two, a lot of people hoped that the we'll call them the less agreeable characteristics of the German mind, would be changed by the traumatic experiences of the second total defeat in twenty years, physical destruction, national humiliation, embarrassment at having been made the collaborators of nazism and so on. 
If anything should have <tag "504537">shaken</> up a national psyche for the Germans it was World War two and what it did to them.

Perhaps Halifax heard the call of conscience in the watches of the night.

Albert found the news overwhelming.

Mrs Thatcher has already pledged to triple aid for it in forestry projects. 
But today's report, produced jointly by Friends of the Earth, the Ecologist magazine and the World Rainforest Movement, warns the proposals are not working, will promote a massive expansion of logging in key forest areas and do not safeguard the rights of the inhabitants.

By the time I was 22, I'd run up nearly #4,000 in debt, and was beginning to fall behind with the payments because I rested sending money off to pay for clothes I'd fallen out of love with.

After the last few days, however, there cannot be many Americans unaware of the existence of a place called Berlin, which was divided by a wall but no longer is. 
The television pictures, the same as seen in Britain, have been shown over and over: the bulldozer breaching the wall; the chiselling and hammering; the fraternising border guards; the embraces and the <tag "516772">handshakes</>; the flowers and champagne; the singing; the dancing and the tears.

These range from the mundane, such as reinforcing masonry walls with steel beams to strengthen them, to the exotic, such as supporting an entire building on rubber so that the structure `floats" in isolation.

In ones and twos callers trickled to the stilled house all that evening. 
They murmured `Sorry" as they <tag "504337">shook</> hands with Rose and Michael and the three girls, blessed themselves as they entered the room, knelt by the foot of the bed to pray, and touched the dead hands or forehead in a gesture of leave-taking when they rose.   

800698
Ten minutes later Maras regained the lead, when scrum half Darren Kenyon picked up at the base of the scrum and ran 50 metres unopposed to score in the corner. 
Maras went close to scoring again, but Wheatley held them at bay and counter-attacked in the last two minutes. 
As the match went into injury time, Wheatley forced their way over for a pushover try touched down by Risto Gronmark and converted by Cairns to leave Maras <tag "504336">shaking</> their heads.

She opened the tournament by overhwelming Martinez, two years older and the world No. 10 with a relentless double-fisted assault.

WATCHING Peter Handke's The Long Way Round, a so-called `dramatic poem", is rather like trying to jog through porridge and about as useful. 
In its 25-year history I doubt whether the National Theatre has ever before presented a piece of work which <tag "504337-m">shakes</> hands with gibberish, welcomes gibberish as a friend and in the end extols gibberish as something with which you may live contentedly ever after.

He dwells on frightening descriptions of innocent bodies covered with grotesque lesions, tells stories of fiance&acute.s who prefer to commit suicide rather than risk contaminating their beloveds, and generates anxiety by developing an ever-increasing list of possible sources of infection, mostly banal objects of everyday life such as pipes, coins, linen, and ordinary gestures such as kissing the crucifix at communion or <tag "504337">shaking</> hands.

Neither Lloyd George nor Mosley could stir the enthusiasm for new ways which F. D. Roosevelt was to arouse a little later in the United States.

For the fourth day the Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryskov, was still pressing deputies to accept a huge increase in prices as a painful first step.

IN a new twist to the old story of determining exactly who is a Jew, Israel's High Court ruled yesterday that people converted to Judaism by non-Orthodox rabbis could be legally registered as Jews by the state.

800808
`Yes, Nana." 
Martha turned and <tag "504585">shook</> off her idleness, realising that the old woman would continue enumerating chores if she were not distracted.   

800809
AS Czechs and Slovaks celebrated the collapse of communist supremacy yesterday, it remained in doubt whether the final prize &dash. the presidency &dash. was safely in the opposition's hands. 
At noon, in a salute to the arrival of democracy, Prague echoed with blasts from factory sirens and car horns, and jingled to the more decorous <tag "504338">shaking</> of keys.  

800810
Why? 
Because this poltroon in a peaked cap had mistaken the Peugeot lion for the Vauxhall Wyvern, and when I said the keys were for a Peugeot he <tag "504336">shook</> his head ponderously and said they weren't.   

800811
The Prussian Captain spoke angrily to Sharpe in German. 
Sharpe <tag "504336">shook</> his head.`   

800812
I can only wish you Godspeed." 
They both <tag "504337">shook</> hands with him and, as if by magic, the young lieutenant appeared from the shadows and ushered them out. 

800813
Few have exploited the orchestra's `special effects" department more pleasurably or lavishly than Richard Strauss. 
He was especially keen on the wind machine, an unholy contraption which entails a wooden barrel being rotated against silk or canvas. 
He used it in Don Quixote and in his huge Alpine Symphony, where he also has fun with the thunder machine (used by Wagner in Siegfried, Act III), either a vast sheet of metal, <tag "504338">shaken</>, or a barrel operated like the wind machine using heavy balls instead of cloth.   

800814
The same section of the population remarked in November `that the Fu&umlaut.hrer had spoken more than normally about God", that `apparently even among the old Nazis there's nothing more doing without God", which accorded badly, however, with the way the Party was treating the Church. 
Hitler's remarks stressing the work of `Providence" on Germany's side prompted only <tag "504336">shaking</> of the head among `academics" and the `higher circles" of society.  

800815
They will also have to keep the prices at which they sell imported goods purchased with foreign currency at levels charged at state-controlled outlets. 
THE SOVIET authorities yesterday finally handed over the meagre personal effects of a man who they insist died 42 years ago: a diplomatic passport with its faded blue cover bearing the Swedish coat of arms, money, a selection of old notebooks and identity cards. 
But even this, and a meeting yesterday with senior KGB and Foreign Ministry officials, have failed to <tag "504412">shake</> the conviction of relatives and friends of Raoul Wallenberg.   

800816
On the last day, I thought Nick would have to play really well, which he did, and Ray Floyd would have to make a mistake, which he did. 
I was never nervous on the course but when we had finished the round I was <tag "504355">shaking</>. 

800817
`How?" He shrugged. 
`My friend, if you'd spent two years burning up with sulphur injections, or <tag "504355">shaking</> from haloperidol, you too might develop certain uncanny abilities.   

800818
Wexford shook him roughly and jerked his head back. 
Their eyes met and for a moment Wexford still held on to the electrician's coat collar, shaking it as might a man who has brought a destructive dog under control. 
Jack's jowls <tag "504338 or 504355">shook</> and his teeth chattered.   

800819
The vehicles are still behind us. 
We have to <tag "516626">shake</> all of them off." 

800820
Flexibility has its costs, however. 
Large deflections can help to loosen non-structural cladding and <tag "504537">shake</> up the building's contents like dice in a box.   

800821
She could not restrain a flash of pride in her physical fitness; all the nurses were smaller than she was and, although they were prettier, she felt her dignity and certainty returning. 
She had imagined that the doctor would be male; she had looked forward to it even, a chance to pit herself against him, to resist, to overcome; but when she was finally ushered into the consulting room she was greeted by a woman younger than herself. 
This shocked her suddenly, <tag "504410">shook</> her back into the real world and changed the entire course of the interview.   

800822
`This is Inspector Lynch, he's head of the team who've been watching your man over here." 
A slim, clean-cut man with fair hair <tag "504337">shook</> her hand.   

800823
Mark Forster scored Warrington's crucial try in the last minute. 
CURTIS STRANGE was still <tag "504355">shaking</> moments after he sank a four-foot birdie putt on the fifth hole at PGA West yesterday &dash. a putt worth dollars 60,000 in California's Skins Game. 

800824
When it finally stopped at my floor, I got out and closed the door. 
The `stationary" lift just kept on <tag "504355">shaking</>.   

800825
In the bar he came across Christy O'Connor Jnr, the Irish hero whose majestic shot to the 18th in the Ryder Cup singles will survive as one of the most thrilling memories of this sporting year. 
`I had tears in my eyes watching you come down the 18th fairway," O'Connor said, reaching out to <tag "504337">shake</> Murray by the hand. 

800826
Then his young friend turned his head towards him and gave a jerk of invitation. 
The captain, his white face flushing, <tag "504336">shook</> his head.   

800827
`I can find the odd five thousand from somewhere." 
He <tag "504337">shook</> Winkler's hand.   

800828
The biggest change &dash. and the one which worries him most &dash. is the increase in heavy traffic along the A329 which divides the village. 
He said: `Those heavy lorries are <tag "504338">shaking</> our village to pieces."   

800829
Yet he made something equally effective of a throwaway gesture such as the insouciant flick of his moustache at the very end of the solo. 
John's sense of fun was in notably rich form, achieving some sure-fire laughs by such simple but ingenious devices as having Capitano Adoncino dance in with a crisply military series of cabrioles while a servant chased after him to take his hat and cloak, or having the gallant captain and Signor Midas <tag "504337">shake</> hands while both performing entrechats.   

800830
She was unaware that her ryes were glistening Kerly looked at the cloth she was weaving, then back at her. 
While he was doing this she'd hidden her hands behind her, but he'd noted earlier they were <tag "504355">shaking</>.

`Immersing myself in what's sometimes a very ugly world isn't easy.

`I shall leave," Mr Watts cut in, <tag "504355">shaking</>. 

800833
He said he was thinking of renting a weekend house in the hills, and a few days of particularly oppressive weather provided the excuse for a drive to inspect it. 
She found herself lying under him in a cool shuttered bedroom that projected from the steep hillside over the treetops, smiling and content, feeling his <tag "504355">shaking</> hands on her legs, smelling his acrid sweat and sweet aftershave against the musty background of the mattress.  

800834
`You will have to excuse me now." 
Martha stood up and offered her hand to be <tag "504337">shaken</>.   

800835
Then Wexford questioned him and probed and used all the subtlety years of experience had given him. 
Pertwee held his wife's hand, <tag "504336">shook</> his head, answered monosyllabically and at last he dried up. 

800836
So now you know! 
<tag "504585">Shake</> off those blues and put a little colour into your life.   

800837
By the close Essex had built a lead of 76 with half their wickets in hand. 
Seaside grounds have their own lore, and the sages of Southchurch Park <tag "504336">shook</> their heads when Chris Cowdrey announced that he intended to make Essex field. 

800838
The clock gleamed a phosphorescent midnight. 
What is happening to me, she asked, sitting on the bed and holding out a <tag "504355">shaking</> hand, what is wrong? 

800839
`Nana said I was always hungry." 
`Maybe she's been ill &dash. have you darling?" On the wide bench seat her mother held her close. 
Martha <tag "504336">shook</> her head, feeling tiredness descend on her like the low cloud on the mountains, muffling all her emotions. 

800841
According to his bodyguard, the old satyr personally `initiated" his more attractive lady disciples in the privacy of his own bedroom. 
HIS WELL-DRESSED supporters on the huge scaffolding stage light up when their candidate appears and fight with security men for a kiss or <tag "516772">handshake</> from the tall, grinning man in a red-striped polo shirt. 

800842
She broke down and wept bitterly when Wexford told her that that her husband's supplementary income had come from a criminal source. 
He was almost sure that it was all a revelation to her and he watched her in sad silence as she covered her face and <tag "504355">shook</> with sobs. 

800843
Plans to install an anti-aircraft battery on one of the bridges over the Seine have finally been shelved following protests from the city authorities. 
ANEW round of Angolan talks is underway, amid conflicting interpretations of the historic <tag "516772">handshake</> in Gbadolite, Zaire, between President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and the Unita leader, Dr Jonas Savimbi, which led to the first ceasefire between MPLA government troops and the rebels in 14 years. 

800844
Asked why Harry responded to her, and not his owner, Janet replied: `Well it may be because the first time he bit me, I knocked him off his perch." 
To wake Harry up, she <tag "504338">shook</> a cassette tape in front of him.   

800845
Germans Gift of Cigars &dash. An officer in the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry described a similar scene: The Germans showed themselves over the trenches which are only 50 yards off and held their hands up and then got up on top of the trench and sent men out halfway towards out lines. 
They put cigars down and then one of our side went out and they <tag "504337">shook</> his hand and said: `Let us have a day off as it is Christmas and we won't do any shooting." 

800846
We peasants piled into the church to inspect the decorations and the less important of the 280 guests invited to the church made their way to their cars inside the Park gate. 
They had reached the Palace and were telling the remainder of the 700 guests at the reception how well the wedding had gone before a sudden squall of rain brought down a wet curtain on Woodstock's afternoon of aristocratic splendour. 
`What I would like now," said Doris, <tag "504337">shaking</> my frozen hand, `is a nice hot cup of tea."   

800847
Unemployment insurance, administered through the labour exchanges, cut across the Poor Law, which was in local hands. 
The foundations of laissez faire were <tag "504412">shaken</>.   

800849
There was something incredible about the proximity of that dark hole and that silence. 
Dora <tag "504336">shook</> her head violently. 

800850
Bill Bowes caught the 17-year-old Len Hutton, a shy, reserved junior member of the dressing room but already regarded as a batting genius, smiling quietly to himself. 
When taxed Len <tag "504336">shook</> his head: `I'm laughing at myself. 

800851
Some economists said last night that it could be transformed into a mini-Budget &dash. a device not used since the days of Labour government &dash. including higher taxes. 
Alan Budd, chief economic adviser to Barclays Bank, said that it was too early to assess the implications of the <tag "516391">shake-up</>.   

800852
`I'm Natasha." 
`And I'm Maggie" They <tag "504337">shook</> hands.   

800853
To understand how engineers are preparing for earthquakes, one needs to know a little about how buildings behave when shaken. 
Place several dishes of jelly on a table and rhythmically shake the edge. 
The jellies will <tag "504338">shake</> too, but some more than others.   

800854
Is the coastguard adequately funded and giving the public the service it expects?" 
Terry Moore, chairman of the coastguard section of the National Union of Civil and Public Servants, said: `The service is in a hell of a mess and a damn good <tag "516391">shake-up</> is needed.   

800855
That succinct remark identified the total commitment to winning that enabled Geech and his players to travel from the pit of depression to the euphoria of success in seven short days. 
No one should underestimate the mental and physical effort required to <tag "504585">shake</> off the shock of a Test defeat in so short a time.   

800856
Now the Court will be a curiosity in the grounds of the Abbey." 
Dora <tag "504336">shook</> her head.   

800857
So both men were given almost equal prominence and Le Barre virtually killed off any audience interest with a heavy speech. 
Chirac didn't even know where to go while Le Barre was speaking on an empty white platform with no chairs, and when it was his turn to speak he had no chance of a good clean start because he had to <tag "504337">shake</> hands with Le Barre as they passed on the stairs.   

800859
He wasn't going to miss his chance of another picture. 
Dora <tag "504336">shook</> her head and he charged off through the mob. 

800860
His skin was sallow, and ignorant tourists have been known to enquire why the Emperor of Japan's postcard was so popular in the racks. 
He was a tall man, standing a full 6ft 3in, and even in old age his <tag "516772">handshake</> was almost bone-crunchingly strong.   

800861
He said that nobody would believe it, but that he could assure them, that that very afternoon Betty had stood beside her errant husband after his horse won and had accepted the trophy with him. 
He then leaned across and said that he could tell them something that would <tag "504410">shake</> them.   

800862
`I just hope you don't think it's disrespectful of me saying so in the circumstances." 
She <tag "504336">shook</> her head.

He knew everything we said to him. 
We taught him to sit up and beg, and to <tag "504337">shake</> hands.   

800864
The Danes's lingering hopes were dashed with news of West Germany's 2-1 triumph over Wales. 
Piontek, looking <tag "516551">shaken</> by the defeat, said: `It is very, very likely I shall not continue as Denmark's coach any longer.   

800865
Even small children on tricycles. 
Sprott took a sip, <tag "504336">shook</> his head violently and started to bang himself on the back of the head.  

800866
`I don't think so." 
`What say?" I <tag "504336">shake</> my head.  

800867
At the beginning of 1941 he decided that he must rescue Mussolini after all. 
Squadrons of the Luftwaffe were sent to Sicily, where they soon <tag "504410">shook</> British control of the central Mediterranean; an Afrika Korps under Rommel was prepared for Libya; and Hitler also prepared to knock out Greece.   

800868
Refugees from Kuwait and Iraq threatened by disease and starvation. 
British evacuees return home after a gruelling journey across the desert. 
And, the leaders of North and South Korea finally <tag "504337">shake</> hands.   

800869
As Winston Churchill was to write on a different occasion, `at first the steps were wide and shallow, covered with a carpet, but in the end the very stones crumbled under their feet." 
One of the men who had to walk down this precarious companion-way was Malcolm MacDonald, the British dominions secretary in 1938, still vainly attempting to reconcile the desperate promises of the First World War before the outbreak of the Second, trying to preserve order in the British mandate of Palestine by restricting Jewish immigration. 
Forty years later, I sat in the drawing-room of his home at Sevenoaks in Kent, watching him <tag "504336">shake</> his head vigorously from side to side as he contemplated the ruins of his own efforts to resolve the Palestine problem.   

800870
But bouts of all four continue to cast doubt on the quality of the group's earnings and share rating, while high interest rates are not helping trading in the non-food activities which make up 35 per cent of profits. 
Unigate shares, as a speculative play, suffered more than most in the late summer <tag "516391">shake-up</> in the stock market.   

800871
Always cover pillows with two pillowcases for protection and treat spills and stains quickly. 
Remove the pillow cases, push the filling away from the affected area and hold it back with an elastic band, then treat the case as necessary. 
Pillows need daily plumping up by <tag "504338">shaking</> them vigorously and pushing the sides toward the middle several times.   

800872
After this remarkable visit, the volcano continued to be active for a week  or two, but the explosive activity died down somewhat, and it began to look  as though the eruption was going to be just a nine-days' wonder, and would  soon fade away and be forgotten. 
On 19 June, however, things began to warm up again, and the plume of steam  and ash, which had been showing signs of flagging, rose higher and higher  as more and more powerful explosions <tag "504338">shook</> the air. 

800873
George told her his name was Richard Crane. 
In the street outside there were sounds of a vehicle. 
The man got up and went stealthily to the window, <tag "504336">shook</> his head and came back.   

800874
Moran enjoyed himself and felt cheated when the time came for them to head back for Dublin. 
`The next time you must come for a proper visit," Moran said as he <tag "504337">shook</> his hand by the car.   

800875
The five-times champion then went to Towcester on Thursday where he fell on his only mount, Bar Fly. 
That fall <tag "516708">shook</> Scudamore up quite badly and he had to be passed fit by the racecourse doctor at Ascot yesterday morning before being allowed to take up his two booked rides there. 

800876
His crew was one of the first to arrive at the Clapham rail disaster and he believes the intravenous drips that he set up saved four lives. 
`Kenneth Clarke was happy to <tag "504337?">shake</> hands with us then, but he isn't prepared to recognise that we face the same dangers as police and firefighters."  

800877
Shares have pushed ahead for most of the week. 
Since the <tag "516399">shake-out</> following Nigel Lawson's resignation the broadly based FT-SE share index has climbed more than 90 points.   

800878
He was the highest-ranking official to visit India since the Sino-Indian war. 
China has been badly <tag "504410 or 516551">shaken</> by the strength of international reaction to the assault on Tiananmen Square and its crackdown on dissent, and has taken pains to cultivate the few friends it has left, stressing the theme of Third World solidarity &dash. a theme previously overshadowed by its interest in the superpowers, Japan and Western Europe.   

800879
Don waved back and then gestured towards The Bell Inn where he was clearly heading. 
Charlie <tag "504336">shook</> his head and mouthed the word Tonight!"   

800880
In the North the NAACP, the oldest and largest American civil rights organisation, is regarded as a conservative, conciliatory group. 
In the South, where it vigorously promoted school integration and <tag "504410">shook</> the foundations of white society, it has a much more radical reputation.   

800881
I cannot think when I have enjoyed a visitor so much." 
Alida hauled her up by the arms, plumped up the pillows, and <tag "504338">shook</> them hard, until the dust soared.   

800882
Furthermore, this may or may not be the best of all possible worlds, but it is the only world we have got. 
So far as we can see, this kind of world, in which we are vulnerable and prone to accident, is the only world there could be for the emergence of beings with a genuine freedom of choice in relation to God and to one another. 
So we have fire which warms and also burns; water which slakes our thirst but which can also drown us; earth that both provides for us and <tag "504338">shakes</> us.   

800883
His jaw ached and he realised that he was grinding his teeth, so he released the muscles and tried to relax. 
Instantly an uncontrollable tremor <tag "504338">shook</> his mouth and his legs began to shiver in sympathy.   

800884
Meanwhile, we are left with the world as it is and the responsibility for doing what we can about it. 
So, as Austin Farrer has put it: If an earthquake <tag "504600">shakes</> down a city, an urgent practical problem arises &dash. how to rescue, feed, house and console the survivors, rehabilitate the injured, and commend the dead to the mercy of God; less immediately, how to reconstruct in a way which will minimise the effects of another such disaster.   

800885
Yet the political and moral certainties of the old polarities have dissolved. 
The Gulf conflict is a messy, complex affair, to which the most natural response is for people to <tag "504336">shake</> their heads and confess to not knowing the answers.   

800886
Daniel was working it out, still working it out. 
He knew, for instance, that the marginally more subtle or devious of the people he had met did not rise up and <tag "504353">shake</> their fists at the iniquities of a so-called God but chose instead to blame the dislocations and malfunctions of society (`the system", as they called it from under their hair) for their sense of loss or feeling of being manipulated.   

800887
She could not remember where it came from, but she muttered the line to herself, and the mutter took root in her stomach, grew and blossomed into an enormous belly laugh. 
Maggie saw Hermione <tag "504338">shake</> exasperated shoulders and suddenly feared that she might walk away.   

800888
Earthquakes or tremors usually precede major eruptions, though they are not  often severe, and if correctly interpreted they can save a lot of lives  rather than taking them. 
Quite often, no special sensing apparatus is needed &dash. the <tag "504338">shaking</> is strong  enough to be felt by anyone living in the area.   

800889
Phile Neale showed admirable durability. 
His 62, spread over 200 watchful minutes, was the perfect mixture of care, concentration and aggression. 
It was badly needed after four wickets had fallen for 54; Curtis in Patterson's first over, Hick to Allott's first ball, Lord to a mistimed hook and Botham to a return catch by Allott that had the England all-rounder <tag "504336">shaking</> his head in disbelief all the way back to the pavilion.   

800890
Kylie, however, vehemently refuses to ever discuss the  alleged incident. 
Friends within the Neighbours cast were said to have  claimed the attack left Kylie `badly <tag "516708">shaken</> up."   

800891
But even then it will probably not grab a bigger headline in the Bermudan press than the one accorded to Scotland's Norrie Rowan and Peter Whitelaw, who came to the aid of a local policeman and helped overpower a drug dealer. 
MARTIN POTTER, of Great Britain, will take to the Pacific seas off Sydney's Bondi Beach this weekend, determined to <tag "504585">shake</> off the disappointment of his worst performance of this season's Association of Surfing Professionals world tour, in Queensland's Surfers Paradise last week.   

800892
Why have they done it? 
Monika Mlyarski <tag "504336">shakes</> her head, shrugs her shoulders and says, rather louder than she would have wished: `Freedom."   

800893
The visitor was much troubled by the slum-life he fleetingly observed from the rear window of his limousine and said he was shocked by the rude contrast between these `two Venezuelas". 
He promised bemused correspondents that he would return within a year, <tag "516626">shake</> off his heavy security and don high heels and a wig to visit the barrios unobserved. 

800894
But how can I look him in the face and tell him that's turned out to be true?" 
And it was a little later that same night that his lordship said with some gravity, <tag "504336">shaking</> his head: `I fought that war to preserve justice in this world.   

800895
`Warnie comes home this morning. 
I am lying in bed waiting for him and thinking of him, before I know where I am I hear his boots pounding on the stairs, he comes into my room, we <tag "504337">shake</> hands and begin to talk."   

800896
Through conversations in coffee-houses where so many artists and thinkers met, they infected each other with new ideas. 
Decadence, said Nietzsche, sets in when an aristocracy loses its faith that society is there to serve it, and in Vienna the aristocracy's faith had been <tag "504412">shaken</> repeatedly.   

800897
It seemed important that George Aspinall should not know. 
`Do you fancy a cake?" he asked suddenly, but she <tag "504336">shook</> her head.   

800898
Do you want to talk to me alone before you go to bed?" 
He hesitated, and then <tag "504336">shook</> his head.   

800899
And so I thought, well, if this isn't finished and I offer it to, say, the BBC and it goes out, well, perhaps that would damage his reputation. 
I could picture all those heads <tag "504336?">shaking</> and saying he wasn't that good after all."   

800900
`The hit melodies of that time had to be good dance melodies. 
This being the most important consideration it was better for the lyric-writer to trail along after the composer and fit his words to a refrain written mainly to be danced to." 
Today, we bemoan the reduction of the lyrics on dance songs to grunted exhortations to `git on down, move on up, <tag "504338">shake</> that thang". 

800901
`That might not be a bit of harm!" they smiled back. 
As soon as the dew had been burned off the grass, the whole house was in the hayfield, <tag "516517 or 504584">shaking</> out the heavy tangled lumps of grass the tedder had missed with the fork, raking what was light in from the edges.   

800902
Seeing them all together like that she felt excluded and aggressive, and Noel's exhortations came back to her. 
They had a secure complacent look about them: the spiritual ruling class; and she wished suddenly that she might grow as large and fierce as a gorilla and <tag "504585">shake</> the flimsy doors off their hinges, drowning the repulsive music in a savage carnivorous yell.   

800903
Prisoners, and others, often petition Parliament in an attempt to bring grievances to the attention of Whitehall officials, but the Hughes petition was marked out by its Masonic code. 
To the initiated and informed, the expressions `on the square" and `on the level" are commonplace Freemasonry signals, like the <tag "516772">handshake</> used by Masons, for showing that a man belongs to the brotherhood.   

800904
Moreover, her own position is weaker. 
The lessons of the dramatic past few weeks in British politics have not been lost, as our EC partners' embassies in London busily send back telegrams saying that she has been badly <tag "516551">shaken</>.   

800905
She said: `When I asked him to come to the point, he asked me did I value my life and my job and then said he was going to come and kill me". 
Miss Harding said she began crying and <tag "504355">shaking</> and immediately rang the police.  

800906
`Not too good, Major." 
He <tag "504336">shook</> his head and sighed.   

800907
She began to pull. 
Paul gripped harder and twisted her wrist. 
Dora began to <tag "504355">shake</>.  

800908
The door of the lean-to was tried. 
He saw the man wander into the apple store and out again, watched him <tag "504336">shake</> his head over the abandoned tractor and the unfinished grass cutting, heard him moving around close to the cottage.

RUTH LAWRENCE, the mathematics prodigy who became Oxford University's youngest doctor of philosophy at the age of 18, was not sure whether she would be treated as a celebrity or a curiosity when she took up her research fellowship at Harvard this week. 
After years in the limelight when she first went up to Oxford at the age of 11, accompanied by her father, Ruth eventually <tag "516626">shook</> off the hordes of journalists who wanted to interview her every time she passed an exam.  

800912
Holly's great dark eyes grew serious. 
`You said there wasn't a suicide note, but what do you think this is?" Rain <tag "504336">shook</> her head.

Goose feathers are stronger than duck and keep their bounce longer. 
Cheaper feather pillows are filled with chicken feathers which are naturally straight and have to be curled artificially.

It starts with a tendentious analysis of history.

There's a pushchair next to her, but it's empty. 
`Got a fag, luv?" She <tag "504336">shakes</> her head.

Star ballerinas have flounced out of rehearsal because the steps, or their makers, have given them offence. 
And timid juniors have been harried into submission by choreographers with a taste for the Pygmalion image. 
Ashton, for instance, used to take mischievous pride in recalling how he literally <tag "504338 or 504410">shook</> the young Fonteyn into dancing the way he wanted.   

800922
Vigo had an attractive, rather boyish laugh. 
He checked it with a <tag "516365">shake</> of his head.   

800924
`Can you give me a hand?" she asked, which he did. 
`I'll walk you to the Commemorative Hall if you like?" She <tag "504336">shook</> her head.

You're quite reluctant to think of the bad points because it suddenly seems like the most perfect patch of land on this planet. 
I have been there many times and had many unshakeable criticisms, which now have, of course, been <tag "504412">shaken</>."   

800927
As Michael looked at him, and then returned his gaze to the road, he had a very distinct impulse to thrust his hand into the front of Toby's shirt. 
The next instant, as if this thought had acted as a spark, he had a clear visual image of himself driving the Land-Rover into a ditch and seizing Toby violently in his arms. 
Michael <tag "504336">shook</> his head as if to clear away a slight haze which was buzzing round him.   

800928
However, the 23 points scored on the back nine by Peter Smith proved the hottest of the last nine holes burn-up to give him the first of the season's trophies. 
Others involved in the <tag "516391">shake-up</> were Martin Gould, Fred Willers, Gordon Brooks and Steve Rimmer.

Moreover under Nicolae Titulescy, twice president of the council of the League of Nations, Romania conducted until 1934 a strongly pacifist and anti-fascist external policy. 
After 1932, the consequences of the economic crisis originating in the Wall Street crash of 1929 <tag "504410">shook</> the political foundations of all the Eastern European countries opening the way to such adventurers as King Carol of Romania, Stoyadinovic of Yugoslavia, Colonel Beck of Poland, who played funny games with Hitler and thus destroyed their pro-Allied foreign policy and their democracies.   

800930
The Americans' man in Zaire, President Mobutu Sese Seko, also backed by France and Belgium, is becoming a hideous embarrassment: he has impoverished his country and oppressed its people. 
In Liberia, where the United States backs the ruler and the local dollar, the Americans are at last <tag "504585">shaking</> off the deplorable Mr Samuel Doe, whom they took under their wing by sheer carelessness after he killed the previous oligarchs in 1979. 

800931
On that occasion, too, my father was sleeping when I entered. 
But the chambermaid Miss Kenton had left in attendance stood up upon seeing me and began to <tag "504338">shake</> my father's shoulder.

`They're animals &dash. that's why." 
`But why?" I look at her, but she just <tag "504336">shakes</> her head.

Apparently, there will be no more tanks, which have proved completely useless in this war, but the Soviets are reported to be looking favourably at a Mozambican request for more combat helicopters. 
WITHIN a week of the momentous <tag "516772">handshake</> between the Angolan President, Mr Jose Eduardo dos Santos, and the Unita leader, Dr Jonas Savimbi, in Zaire, the ceasefire in Angola was broken by Unita, both sides had issued contradictory versions of what had been agreed, and President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, the linchpin of the summit, had gone to Washington in triumph.

`Don't you want to get your overcoat?" she asked, as they passed through the swing doors into the freezing outside air. 
Wilcox <tag "504336">shook</> his head impatiently.   

800938
Governments have not been as irrational and totally careless of life as the experience of the Second World War led many to believe. 
These are factors which provide the basis on which the new environmental security regime can be built, although, sadly, it will probably take more than one catastrophe to <tag "504410">shake</> the world into acceptance of the sacrifices of sovereignty and treasure which will be needed to make it effective. 

800939
After the prayer the man most well known in the community for the beauty of his voice and his repertoire of hymns sang in the praise of the Prophet Muhammed. 
Everyone uttered complimentary phrases, rocked back and forth in rhythm, and joined in the refrains. 
Our sheikh appeared deeply moved and wept, <tag "504355">shaking</> with intense feeling. and gave deafening cries of `Allah!" as the spirit moved him.   

800940
`I'm Don Thomas," I said. 
Her <tag "516772">handshake</> was warm and firm.   

800941
The most commonplace metonymic index of industry &dash. the factory chimney &dash. is also metaphorically a phallic symbol. 
The characteristic imagery of the industrial landscape or townscape in nineteenth-century literature &dash.  tall chimneys thrusting into the sky, spewing ribbons of black smoke, buildings <tag "504338">shaking</> with the rhythmic pounding of mighty engines, the railway train rushing irresistibly through the passive countryside &dash. all this is saturated with male sexuality of a dominating and destructive kind. 

800942
Then he taught her how to play snooker, a heady experience. 
Apart from the occasional <tag "516772">handshake</>, or a guiding hand placed on her arm, he had never touched her before.

Then they were asked to look at a young boy. 
It was Wee Charlie When Maggie and Laura emerged from the mortuary tent they were both severely <tag "516551">shaken</>, but Maggie less so than Laura.

She sat down on it wearily, noting the ornaments out of place and the pictures not quite straight, the tiny traces of someone else's occupation. 
She <tag "504584">shook</> out her lace pillows and rearranged them, suppressing the superstitious dread that she was destined to sleep in this bed alone forever.   

800945
In Yaroslavl the commander-in-chief of Soviet forces in Germany decided to put himself forward as a candidate. 
He was <tag "516551">shaken</> when a colonel, Viktor Podziruk, also chose to run.

At 1 p.m. on the twenty-sixth, explosions loud enough to be heard well over  150 kilometres away were taking place at intervals of about ten minutes,  and at about 2 p.m. an English ship, 120 kilometres from the scene, sighted  a black cloud, rising to an altitude estimated to be about twenty-five  kilometres above the volcano. 
By 3 p.m., the explosions were so loud that  they were audible 240 kilometres away; by 5 p.m. they were so stupendous  that the sound was carrying all over Java. 
In towns such as Batavia, 160 kilometres from Krakatoa, the din was  terrific, the noise being compared with `the discharge of artillery close  at hand &ellip. causing rattling of windows and <tag "504338">shaking</> of pictures,  chandeliers and other hanging objects".   

800947
Albert found the news overwhelming. 
`It has <tag "504410">shaken</> me to pieces." 

800948
He started to laugh. 
His laugh erupted across his face, <tag "504584">shaken</> out of his body, like nausea, rippling across his shoulders, rising in pitch like an operatic soprano and then, suddenly, cutting out, dead.   

800949
His prodigious energy went into work, travel &dash. the West Indies, Australia, America, Iceland, Egypt &dash. and fox-hunting. 
At his peak he owned four horses and hunted three times a week; when he had a fall, the earth <tag "504338">shook</> under the impact, but he never sustained any damage.

The Eagles" loss puts the New York Giants well ahead in the National Conference's eastern division. 
The Giants, even with their second-string quarterback, beat the Phoenix Cardinals, 20-13. 
Minnesota Vikings, <tag "516551">shaken</> after their mauling by the Giants six days earlier, were unable to score a touchdown against the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday.

Mr Andrews says the connection is a coincidence and he has never met Mr Ozturk. 
Mr Scholes may have survived this week's attempts to oust him, but he has yet to succeed in his attempts to <tag "504585">shake</> off the past.   

800953
Short-term interest rates are plainly vulnerable if inflation is not to be accommodated. 
IT IS going to take more than a written statement and mumblings from President Bush about tax revenue increases to <tag "504410">shake</> financial markets out of their chronic scepticism that enough can be done to cut the size of the federal budget deficit enough to bring about lower interest rates.   

800954
He rose and ironically threw a salute so perfect that it would have warmed the vestigial heart of his old colour sergeant. 
Fairbrother reacted sharply with surprise, and the two men <tag "504337">shook</> hands.

Industrial and political circles expressed shock and consternation at this resurgence of terrorism which most had thought, in recent years, had faded away. 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a personal friend of Mr Herrhausen, was visibly <tag "516551">shaken</> as he broke the news to a gathering of 1,000 industrialists which he was addressing in Dusseldorf.

Bob Holt, the chief executive of Tottenham Hotspur, will be excused taking some time off from tracking down the still-mysterious German shareholders on the Spurs register. 
As a lifelong Oldham supporter, Mr Holt would have been over the moon at his side's emphatic victory over Spurs' bitter rivals, Arsenal, in the Littlewoods Cup on Wednesday. 
Among the casualties in the <tag "516399">shakeout</> at Laing &and. Cruickshank is Nick Adam, most noted for his relationship with Pamella Bordes, the House of Commons researcher who hit the headlines and then fled to Bali.

Malcolm Allison is the last English club manager to have worn fedoras with flair, but how did Ms Barbetti rate the travelling fan? 
She pointed at a group of passing English fans wearing flat caps with Lion rampant in blue-and-white piping on an acrylic surface. 
`Tut, tut, tut," she said, <tag "504336">shaking</> her head. 

800964
With so many journalists wishing to talk with Morrissey, Marr, Rourke and Joyce, surely they have no alternative but to step back and carefully choose their outlets. 
Even amid the most carefully documented press articles, minor irrelevances are exaggerated into major sweeping testimonies of the band's incapabilities. 
An example of this occurred in the Nick Kent piece where Geoff Travis described a sardonic and disgruntled Mark E. Smith antagonising a visibly <tag "516551">shaken</> Morrissey by calling him `Steven".   

800966
He was sitting down, his arms spread and his body slumped across the table.

On the other side of the Wall, the sounds of drilling and the sight of clouds of dust swirling above the stark monument to the city's division provoked rounds of frenzied applause and calls of `encore, encore", and `come on, hurry up". 
By 6.30am yesterday a crane was lifting the first slab of the Wall at Potsdamer Platz, revealing the barren wasteland that is all that remains of what was once the bustling heartland of a great European metropolis. 
East and West German police linked arms to hold back the teeming masses as the mayors of both sides of the city, Walter Momper and Erhard Krack, <tag "504337">shook</> hands in a symbolic gesture of the new reality.

However, during my field work with the Toronto Public Welfare, which, during those years, operated with untrained and often uneducated workers, I came into contact for the first time in my life with real poverty; unmarried mothers, women with husbands or sons in jail, syphilitics in the last stages of paresis, retarded parents who didn't know how to their children, chronic tubercular patients and their families.

Sir Geoffrey also said the international community had a big interest in Hong Kong's continuing success as a major financial and commercial centre, a point which would be emphasised at the Paris summit.

Earthquake engineers may not have needed to be reminded that building design can make all the difference between life and death, but the Californian quake has increased public interest in earthquake-resistant designs. 
These range from the mundane, such as reinforcing masonry walls with steel beams to strengthen them, to the exotic, such as supporting an entire building on rubber so that the structure `floats" in isolation. 
To understand how engineers are preparing for earthquakes, one needs to know a little about how buildings behave when <tag "504338">shaken</>.

Hourani describes a sense of secondariness in contemporary Arab identity: `It is no longer to have a standard of values of one's own, not to be able to create but only to imitate; and so not even to imitate correctly, since that also needs a certain originality."

Chile is a country containing many hundreds of volcanoes, twenty-five of  them `active", but of all these it was only Puyehue that erupted. 
There were many reports from up and down the length of Chile of dormant  volcanoes showing signs of reawakening such as strong emissions of  fumarolic steam, but although many of them must have received a severe  <tag "504338">shaking</>, none came to life.

But though musicians occupying the wilder shores of jazz have rarely found widespread acceptance, their explorations of tone colour, thematic development and dynamics have filtered into the mainstream and confirmed their legacy. 
Frank Wright, the Mississippi born saxophonist who has died of a heart attack in Germany, belonged to the ranks of the unruly, and stayed loyal to them through many changes in jazz fashion. 
He was in his 30s when the 1960s `free jazz" eruption, propelled by adventurers like John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman and Cecil Taylor, began to <tag "504412">shake</> and badger the received wisdom of bebop.
