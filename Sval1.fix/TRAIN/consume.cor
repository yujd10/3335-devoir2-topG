The ministry says people could drink such milk for long periods without their health suffering. 
Of the 69 per cent above this level, 4 per cent had lead concentrations above 200 micrograms per litre, the safety level. 
<tag "512646">Consuming</> this milk with this degree of contamination for some time could damage health.

Made from grapes which have long passed their pick-by date, a fine sweet wine's concentration of unctuous, glyceriney fruit and honey flavours goes a long way. 
Given the daring that goes into sweet wine production and the amazing results, I sometimes wonder why we, a sweet-toothed nation, are not more addicted to the decadent luxury of sweet wines. 
Perhaps it is the chocolate eclair principle &dash. there is only so much you can <tag "512646">consume</> in one session &dash. or that if it is sweet, it must be bad for the moral, not to mention physical, fibre.

His prodigious energy went into work, travel &dash. the West Indies, Australia, America, Iceland, Egypt &dash. and fox-hunting. 
At his peak he owned four horses and hunted three times a week; when he had a fall, the earth shook under the impact, but he never sustained any damage. 
Richard Mullen's book, which has involved more than 10 years of research, is entirely enjoyable, huge, and packed with facts; the facts of Trollope's life, naturally, but also the price of a first-class London-Paris return in 1853 (24 shillings), the number of MPs who were beardless in 1874 (two, out of 658), and the number of buns <tag "512646">consumed</> at the Great Exhibition (two million).

Michael Lotito of Grenoble, known as Monsieur Mangetout, has been eating metal and glass since 1959. 
Gastroenterologists have x-rayed his stomach and describe his ability to <tag "512646">consume</> 900g of metal per day as unique.  

800005
The two differing explanations of the origins of such pre-Christian festivals reflect both the creative and destructive elements of fire. 
The solar theory supposes that the balls were sun-charms paraded to ensure a steady stream of sunshine, while the purification theory maintains that the balls would <tag "512657">consume</> the evils of blight, mildew, sterility and witchcraft.

Mobil is looking to siphon off the top 25-30 firms using over 18million therms a year, the briefing notes say. 
`They are looking for firms with an energy requirement in the 1990s in excess of 18million therms per annum. 
Firms <tag "512647">consuming</> 3.5million to 18million therms will be of interest if total demand in the geographical area exceeds 18million therms.

The traditional way of disseminating and institutionalising information within the services and among language groups is not in the main by the written word but by showing and sharing. 
If you have spent a twelve hour day coping with the daily realities of road accidents, the elderly incontinent, housing the homeless &dash. usually with inadequate resources &dash. I promise you that you rarely want to go home and read about it. 
Gathering accurate information and perceptions on which to base our work has been a time <tag "512660">consuming</> and laborious exercise but we have all learnt a great deal in the process and the model which has emerged appears to be acceptable to all of those who have been involved and the information networks have begun to do their time honoured job.

That's sad, but it's the way society has raised them. 
They're born to be automatons, <tag "512657 or 512658">consumed</> by baubles and gimmicks.

While the police tend to stick to the letter of the law, the study revealed a disturbing catalogue of tactics designed to play on suspects' fears and discourage them from taking advice. 
The findings reflect a gulf in attitudes: what most lawyers view as safeguards are <tag "512660">time-consuming</> technicalities to some officers.   

800010
This allows the human to focus on specifying the desired end result, relying on the automatic translator to convert the specification into an equivalent detailed procedure that the computer can execute. 
As in all other matters connected with the implementation of an MIS, the choice of a computer language involves tradeoffs. 
Exercising a high degree of intelligence within a language translator <tag "512647">consumes</> significant computing resources.

The work in Jersey is small scale &dash. a core team of six examining a large Iron Age defensive work which protects a promontory guarding the little harbour of Rozel. 
This particular section of the programme has, over the years, involved eight seasons of excavation at Hengistbury Head in Dorset, three at Mount Batten near Plymouth, together with a fair amount of field work in Brittany, all with the aim of exploring the systems of coastal exchange which linked the communities of the Atlantic sea coasts. 
In the early stages, these systems were focused on exchange of metal, particularly copper and tin, but later, in the first century BC, Roman entrepreneurs moved in, flooding the market with cheap Italian wine which, so the classical sources tell us, was passionately and excessively <tag "512646">consumed</> by the native Celts.

As my hosts are, besides hospitable, extremely compassionate, I envisage at least a handful of additional waifs and strays: shall we say there will be 25 at table? 
The menu of these feasts is as fixed as the movement of the heavens and its pole star is that indigenous fowl, the turkey. 
The rest, more than most can eat and usually <tag "512646">consumed</> without alcoholic assistance (Americans will plough through a banquet on iced tea or coffee), consists of the trimmings.

Although it is still popularly assumed that men are more prone to fall prey to the ravages of `burnout" due to overwork and unhealthy lifestyle, all the evidence now points to women, especially aged between 35 and 50, as today's prime targets of stress. 
The fact that the number of very young women now smoking and <tag "512646">consuming</> alcohol has steadily increased gives grave cause for concern.   

800018
Europe is being used as the rationale for watering down the standards for which Mr Gummer said he would fight." 
Mr Gummer said in a parliamentary written answer last week that it was clear from EC discussions that regulations are likely to apply `safeguards to the end-products, permitting them to be <tag "512646">consumed</> without danger to health, rather than requiring carcasses from infected flocks to be destroyed.

Since 1985 Neste's pre-tax profits have soared to 2 billion markka (Dollars 500m) on net sales of 35 billion markka. 
From nowhere, Neste has become Europe's second-biggest producer of polyolefins, which account for half of all plastics <tag "512683 or 512647">consumed</>.

High-quality, privatised high-rise apartment blocks remain popular. 
No less than 70 per cent of those asked thought that British architects `met peoples" needs when designing shopping precincts', despite the way in which shopping malls have destroyed town centre after town centre. 
The survey, for Crown Berger paints, suggests that the average Briton is keen on shopping and <tag "512683">consuming</> the fruits of consumerism at home.

One company that puts all its business out to tender is Ranks Hovis McDougall, which spends around #18 million per year on electricity supplies for its 60-plus production sites in the UK. 
Group energy buyer Neil Tribick explains that around half the volume is <tag "512647">consumed</> by plants requiring more than 1MW, with the rest in the 100KW to 900KW category.   

800024
The poet Roy Campbell, a Catholic who had fought on the Fascist side in the Spanish Civil War, turned up to meet the famous group of friends. 
Lewis, who had <tag "512646">consumed</> a lot of port before Campbell's arrival, insisted on belligerently reading aloud a lampoon which he had written of Campbell in the Oxford Magazine.

The early rock and roll records, often transferred to tape in breathless live takes, came with their ends neatly trimmed. 
You could argue that a slow fade would have worked on Presley's `That's All Right Mama", but it might prove less <tag "512660">time-consuming</> to claim that Elvis was in fact Dutch.

Glucose and glucose syrup and glucose and fructose together, used in food products, are also damaging and unlikely to prove a good alternative to sucrose derived from sugar beet and cane. 
`Nearly three-quarters of sugars in the UK diet are added during manufacture, cooking or before consumption. 
Confectionary, cakes, biscuits, table sugar . . in tea or coffee, and soft drinks are <tag "512646">consumed</> as snacks and their frequent consumption is strongly linked to decay," the study says. 

800028
Those who promote the benefits of Green consumerism today may themselves see it as a first tiny, faltering step on the road to our Green utopia, but others may be more inclined to see it as the end of the road." 
That road does not end until purchasers, and producers, stop <tag "512647">consuming</> the capital of the earth, and live instead on the interest provided by its resources.

Les Sablons, July 19, 1907: Talking about eating, Madame Bergeret said that in the Midi (neighbourhood of Toulouse specially) there used to be men who prided themselves on enormous powers of eating. 
They did not usually eat a great deal, but on occasions, when put to it, they would perform terrible feats such as <tag "512646">consuming</> a whole turkey.

You may also not know what they are, but the survey that revealed their choice of news-sheet also defined occultism as covering astrology, herbalism, mindpower, ritual, paganism, kabbalah, satanism and spells. 
Three quarters of the 1,000-plus sample said they had no interest in satanism, which may make you feel safer among Guardian <tag "514227">consuming</> friends.

Not only did they power the plutonium factory at Hanford, they also generated the electricity with which Boeing built half the country's aeroplanes, including the one that delivered the plutonium to Nagasaki.

At the moment, however, he feels very negative about the medium: `The shadow of the white paper is hanging over television.

His responses were so volcanic that she was almost frightened, but with him she at last found the licence to release her own demons. 
His body was hard and fit, and it thrilled her to entice him through the long erotic dance to the point where they <tag "512646-x or 512683-x">consumed</> each other without restraint.

Something quite extraordinary had happened, she had achieved something extraordinary.

At first, Rush did not have great success with his autopsies. 
Patricia Leigh Smith who collapsed and died five hours after eating a tuna fish salad at a whist drive in Merton in 1986 had her bones ground up and sifted, but nothing was revealed. 
But then Hugh Padworth, who collapsed and died six hours after <tag "512646">consuming</> a Bakewell tart at a fe&circ.te in Putney, was found to contain traces of arsenic ( HE'S A POISONER VICTIM &dash. IT'S OFFICIAL!"

Furthermore, as core services such as personal workstations and electronic mail become universally used throughout the organization, many charges can be based on a simple head count measure. 
The vast majority of users <tag "512683">consume</> a fairly predictable and low level of services, and so charging on the basis of minor differences among them would have an insignificant effect on total costs; in these cases, then, charges can be based on average per capita usage of the standard set of services.

She did not want to see her undressed. 
Her mother told her to carry up a cup of cocoa for her poor sister and say her prayers, and that she had been a good girl, apart from the incident with the coat. 
Her father put what was left of his change on the dresser and said that James, the driver, could break the bank of Monte Carlo with the amount of sandwiches he <tag "512646">consumed</>.

All of the researchers and clinicians agree that RU 486 will never be given without this medical management, yet they speak out of both sides of their mouths in simultaneously stating that RU 486 gives women more control over abortion. 
The kind of medical supervision the RU 486 requires is not physicial oversight from afar, but a highly medicalized treatment regimen which is multi-stepped, <tag "512660">time-consuming</>, and for many women, pain-producing and long-suffering.

For some time `provocatively perverse" critics have been saying something similar about TV (ie, that ads are better than programmes). 
But the rise of the trailer as self-sufficient form is new. 
Over the last ten years the act of <tag "512683? or 514227">consuming</> a film has changed radically.  

800046
In fact, in these cases the division of labour seems to be the product of the exploitation of women by men, rather than its cause. 
Thus, among South American hunters and gatherers, women are actively excluded from hunting large animals, an occasional but highly valued activity, but, on the other hand, they are expected to supply the basis of daily sustenance through gathering of vegetable products, an activity which men affect to despise, but which is far more time <tag "512660">consuming</>, and infinitely more important for subsistence.

Worse than this, the <tag "512683">consuming</> public was required to incur enormous hirepurchase debts which stimulated chronic inflation, while very low priority was given to `unprofitable" public services such as education, housing and preserving the environment.

`In fact, events have proved that this view was ill-conceived. 
The standard practice now, among those who take moderate amounts, as well as those who <tag "512646">consume</> too much, is either to buy alcohol in supermarkets or off-licences and drink it in the street, or to stay in the pub until the last minute.

Just as the Commission was finishing its work, the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO) was opening its offices in Japan. 
This group implements a 1985 agreement on the production and use of industrial wood from tropical nations, an agreement that took nine years to negotiate. 
ITTO provides a sign of hope in that producing and <tag "512683">consuming</> countries are working together towards the sustainable use of tropical forests; its recent initiatives to listen to the views of environmental-group representatives should increase its effectiveness.

Oats, bran included, can be found in oat cakes and muesli bars.

The opposition is quite capable of bringing the country to a halt if the Communists try to block Mr Havel's election.

The neisseria are ail Gram-negative organisms. 
The white cells from the blood, the polymorphonuclear leucocytes or `pus cells", which are responsible for scavenging and <tag "512657">consuming</> unwelcome intruders in the body, can be seen to have phagocytosed, or eaten, the bacteria, which thus become `intracellular".

Other reasons for dissatisfaction were lack of opportunity to use their abilities, hours of work, physical working conditions, industrial relations, lack of recognition for good work, management of schools and lack of promotion chances. 
One in five teachers smoked and 8 per cent of smokers believed their habit was related to stress. 
In addition, 88.1 per cent drank on average the equivalent of more than five pints of beer a week with 21.2 per cent <tag "512646">consuming</> the equivalent of more than 10 pints.

The supplying subsystem feeds its output to the buffer, rather than directly into the using subsystem; the using subsystem then obtains its input from the buffer. 
In a chemical plant, for instance, an intermediate raw material is almost always kept temporarily in a storage facility before being <tag "512683 or 514227">consumed</> in a downstream process.

He was twittering animatedly about the game with his father, who had clearly come second and looked as if he had played for a couple of hours with Jansher Khan. 
It seemed no way to treat a man who had obviously <tag "512646">consumed</> more than his helping of wine, turkey, Christmas pudding, sprouts, brandy, mince pies, sherry, roast potatoes, lashings of brandy butter and a few glasses of port.

Both Ms Sellars and Mr Black agree it could have been a deep-seated resentment against his wife, added to other factors which made the explosive mix ignited by the sight of Marie Wilks.

While there are a few outsiders, the three children have been trained to keep the business growing. 
The unassuming elder son, Andrew, went off to sell exotic foods to the French, finding that a motor-bike enabled him to visit more customers; the ebullient Audrey worked for Kleinwort Benson for a couple of years and returned with dozens of ideas for new products, for franchising the name, and for setting up Baxters' shops similar to the one which attracts 150,000 visitors a year at Fochabers; while the youngest, Michael, has just returned from the Hong Kong Hilton kitchens before he sets out to conquer the upmarket hotel and catering market, which already <tag "512646">consumes</> 25m individual-size jars of Baxters marmalade every year.

Its recommendations suggest product labelling so consumers can see how much hidden sugar is added to products such as baked beans or ketchup. 
It reserves its concerns for `extrinsic" or added sugars rather than `intrinsic" sugars occurring naturally in foods. 
It states: Sugars are the most important cause of tooth decay and everyone should have <tag "512646">consume</> less food and drink containing sugar; Sugars should not be added to bottle feeds or drinks for young children; Family cooks and caterers should reduce the amount of sugary snacks available; Manufacturers should produce low sugar or sugar-free alternatives; People who eat more than 200 grams a day should replace some of it with starchy food; Sugars and fats contribute to obesity so slimmers should reduce sugar intake as well as that of other food.

But now that I had the Bug to care for three days a week, I noticed that this phrase, which I had remembered only as something puzzlingly out of character, was coming to mind increasingly frequently, and seeming each time to capture more exactly the real pneumatics of the parental sensation: sometimes in looking at the Bug I felt as it I was crumpling up, hunching my shoulders, deflating like a pool-side flotation toy to be folded away for the winter &dash. the same collapsing feeling that Mal Green had induced by forcing me to play the Chiarnovsky in one breath: not the vocal hoarseness of prolonged shouting or whispering or even of talking for hours on a long car trip, but the deeper lungier expiration of blowing up a balloon (especially on an empty stomach), and transferring your pneuma to it. 
My mother, who I think loved my sister and me to the point of heart-hoarseness, taught us how to make clay coin banks by blowing up and tying balloons and then wrapping them in gray clay: we pinched the surfaces of the clay-covered balloons into guinea pigs or owls or bullfrogs (one of the teaching assistants did a nice caricatured head of my mother), but as we worked we were still able to sense the poppable resilience of the pale spheres underneath. 
And then coin slots were carefully cut and the clay banks were allowed to dry and fired to an off-white gritty color in a kiln: and our selfless balloons within were &dash. my mother taught us the word &dash. `vaporized" in thousands of degrees of heat: I shook my heavy frog bank and heard a slight dead-light-bulb tinkle &dash. crumbs no doubt of the vanished but heroic balloon (of the bunchier, tied navel part that always tended downward when the balloon was aloft?), which had been <tag "512657?">consumed</>, along with our hoarse inflating breaths, in order to maintain the essential hollowness around which an animal likeness was only decoration, a hollowness I slowly filled with coins I found in the cool depths of the blue couch or under the seat of the car or on the alcove rug near the stereo albums, and then restored once again by sliding the change coin by coin out of the slot with the blade of a butter knife, as a baby-sitter showed us, in order to buy Christmas presents, and then filled up again.

The thrilling strength of Olwen Fouere's portrayal is that she actually plays what she is meant to be: Solness's inner voice. 
More physically contained than the rest of the cast, she stands blade-backed and grave-eyed, her feet held in fourth position like a Degas ballerina, her whole psyche <tag "512658">consumed</> with Timothy West's definitive Solness.
