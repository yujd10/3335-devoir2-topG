The foundation for the great clean-up was laid with the electronics revolution that burgeoned in the Eighties, and will continue into the third millenium. 
Computerised management systems that control combustion processes are the key to engine efficiency, and to the likely comeback of discredited concepts like the two-stroke engine (Ford and GM have invested heavily in an Australian design) and gas turbines (showing <tag "537626">promise</> in ceramics as a clean source of power).

More impervious to the general euphoria was the Conventional Forces in Europe conference in Vienna, which has been marking time and solemnly discussing an acceptable technical definition of a tank.

A bastion of eternal optimism, however, the commission speaks proudly of its `achievements" (which cost the state nearly dollars 3m ( #1.9m) a year).

Companies like Leine &and. Linde will only succeed in foreign markets if they are able to tailor their products to local needs, explains Bengt Imberg, L &and.L's president and formerly a senior manager in the domestic appliances division in Sweden of Philips, the Dutch electronics group.

It was here, more than 2,000 miles east of Moscow, that the great Soviet strikes of last summer began. 
For seven days a nation held its breath as grievances unanswered for a generation exploded, like a deadly accumulation of methane gas in the mine itself. 
Only government <tag "537566">promises</> of self-management, improvements in food supplies and living conditions, and measures to protect the ravaged environment of the coal basin, persuaded them back to work.

Next she went as a shop girl to a small town near Dublin and had a string of boyfriends from the terraces, when an aunt brought her to New York. 
There, she showed the family trait of a willingness to work, first in an ice-cream factory, next in a dry-cleaning place and finally as a waitress, where she found that her good humour and energy could earn her more in a week than she could save in a year in Ireland. 
She had lived with an older man but felt used when he showed no sign of keeping <tag "538409">promises</>.

Kossuth in turn endeavoured to create a much stronger popular nationalist alliance of classes on the basis of radical reforms. 
He <tag "537527">promised</> an end to serfdom, reform of landholdings and an extension of the suffrage, a programme which in turn alienated an important part of the Magyar gentry and rendered them much more favourably disposed to suspending national demands in favour of outside intervention to protect existing social relationships.

At the gates of hell, you felt, the Ceausescus would still be insisting that they had earned a place in paradise. 
The new provisional government regretted the summary justice but said that the execution was essential in order for the bloodshed in the country to end. 
Meanwhile, free elections were <tag "537527">promised</> for the spring of next year.

The social sciences could not satisfy either of these criteria. 
Their propositions were often vague and irrefutable by concrete evidence; and though economics and sociology in their early days made great <tag "538411">promises</> for the reform of society through understanding, these promises have not, Sir Keith believed, been fulfilled.

For the most part, though, it was the power game at every turn. 
Henri Leconte, another player of imagination many would like to see succeed on grass, <tag "537656">promised</> much but eventually failed to deliver against the burly Austrian Alex Antonitsch and went down 2-6, 6-4, 7-6, 2-6, 6-3.

Walter Nestle's writings during the thirties certainly ought to have warned scholars that their confidence in the early date was much exaggerated, and he will always he remembered with admiration for his stand against dogmatic orthodoxy. 
But even if Nestle had been spared to offer the exhaustive treatment of the subject that he <tag "537527">promised</>, the severe limitations of our knowledge of Aeschylus would hardly have allowed him to put the case for a late date beyond reasonable doubt.   

800037
The plan was vague in that neither the electorate nor the permissible subjects for discussion were precisely defined. 
Nevertheless, it contained <tag "537626">promise</> and excited some interest.

One respects the authority which is founded on the very fact of being so respected.

It recommended that a subsidy of #4.9m should be provided during the financial year 1984-85, and the Government, accepting this advice, increased its grant to the Arts Council accordingly. 
The Minister for the Arts reported to Parliament that the increased subsidy would enable the company to `operate on a satisfactory basis in the future" and promised that `provision will also be made for subsequent years." 
That <tag "538409">promise</> has not been kept.

The Foreign Office yesterday acknowledged that negotiations with Hanoi for the mandatory repatriation of `economic migrants" from Vietnam were well advanced, although difficulties remain over the administration of funds that Britain is prepared to give for the resettlement of the boat people. 
Well aware how sensitive such a move is bound to prove, Britain is seeking to make repatriation more palatable by <tag "537527">promising</> that physical force will not be used to put Vietnamese on planes bound for Hanoi, and that each person will have the right to refuse.

COAL miners have returned to the midnight shift at mines in Mezhdurechensk after a strike that paralysed coal production in the Siberian city, a local official said yesterday. 
He said the workers, who had demanded more local control and a reduced role for the Communist Party, had voted to go back to work after mining officials <tag "537527">promised</> to meet demands on living conditions and increased holidays.

Derek Jacobi's reading of Gertrude Stein's poem in the first piece was considered over-emphatic and intrusive and the now familiar string of invective was again hurled at Wayne Eagling's glam-rock version of Mary Shelley's classic. 
The most unforgiveable thing about the ballet is that it prevents anyone using this <tag "537614">promising</> subject for a while.

The commissioner could take cases such as a breach of union election or balloting rules to the civil courts on behalf of unionists. 
The Government has proposed a tough code of practice on balloting, a code which will be admissible in court.

David Howell (C, Guildford) said the causes of freedom and prosperity throughout Europe would be best served by the separate development of the Germanies, despite recent dramatic moves towards democracy in the East. 
`I think it is at least reasonable for us to point out as friends that in terms of a broader scheme of a free confederation, they may be better off remaining separate, both liberalising and developing as market economies, rather than having one giant republic of 80 million people." 
His appeal came as MPs had their first chance to debate the political repercussions of the opening of the Berlin Wall last week and the <tag "537566">promise</> of free democratic elections in East Germany.

The broad comedy he brings into the drama is, like the operatic emotions of the romantic plot, performed with masterly finesse. 
As not only Chubei and Umegawa but also Yohei and his wife find themselves under sentence of death from the Shoguns' inexorable laws, both couples make a suicide pact. 
In Yohei's case, this collapses into a craven botch &dash. hilariously acted by Ryo Amamiya &dash. in which he more or less accidentally dispatches his wife but can't bring himself to take the plunge and throw himself into the river as <tag "537527">promised</>.

LABOUR Party leaders are expected to clarify their position on the pre-entry closed shop before the Commons Second Reading debate on the Government's new industrial relations legislation.

Platt's volley did the rest and at the final whistle Gascoigne embraced an England manager whose career in charge of the national side had been seconds away from the possibility of ending in a shoot-out.

Overall, the commission praises the `exemplary" recognition of the importance of training.

Other common-law countries have not been spared by mass disasters any more than the United States, but for various reasons their courts have not been significantly confronted with the consequential legal problems. 
In the Thalidomide tragedy, for example, the prevailing doubts in England concerning recovery for pre-natal injuries caused the problem to be shifted to the political forum in order to enlist Parliamentary pressure for settlement. 
In other incidents, like the Turkish Airline crash outside Paris, claimants went `forum shopping" and sought American jurisdiction because it offered more <tag "537614">promising</> procedural facilities and surer as well as higher awards than their countries of domicile.

The images of Fu&umlaut.hrer and Party, which for almost a decade after the `seizure of power" had been largely separate and even diametrically opposed, were now starting to blur in public consciousness. 
But a diminishing, though still powerful, minority ensured that the `Hitler myth" was kept alive and could even be temporarily revitalized from time to time when there was a transient upturn in Germany's fortunes or the <tag "537566">promise</> of suitable retaliation for people's miseries.   

800077
She is Labour past. 
Labour present is Neil Kinnock, who speaks for 63 minutes and quotes Robert Frost about miles to go and <tag "538409">promises</> to keep, and about a brighter dawn when poverty, privilege, fear, disease, woe, and war shall live only in the memory of time.

In March 1939 the British government tried the resort of a Round Table conference &dash. an expedient which proved as barren as it had done for Ireland and India.

As the end of a month draws near, stretching your money until the next pay cheque arrives often becomes difficult. 
Some unexpected expense always seems to crop up when you least want it to and throws your careful calculations out of the window.

The deal is valuable to Wadham as a reliable long-term source of income in the competitive field of holiday lettings, in which most Oxford colleges are now involved.

Taylor, long ignored by the Oxfordshire selectors, has been snapped up by Middlesex and could be on the fringe of a first class career. 
The first class county last week signed on the 23-year-old left arm fast bowler on a dual registration with Oxon, in order to be able to play him in the first team.

With only a few exceptions, whether it was in the north of India or the south, whichever party was in power locally crashed to conclusive defeat. 
At the heart of this remarkable voters' onslaught was not just dismay at Mr Gandhi and his sordid fall from grace; it rather represented a mass outpouring of contempt and disgust with ordinary Indian politicians who never keep their <tag "538409">promises</> and who only bother with their constituents when they need their votes.

Evidence that the SCN are the body clock can be summarized as follow: 
Rhythmic electrical activity can be recorded from the nerve cells that make up the SCN and this rhythm has a period of about 24 hours.

IT IS hard now to remember that just after the 1987 general election we pundits and commentators were actually worried about what we were going to write about for the next four years. 
With the Alliance in ruins and Herself back in Downing Street for yet another term, it looked like being an unbroken diet of the Trials Of Neil Kinnock. 
But here we are, two years on, reflecting on a summer of Government disasters while we wait for what <tag "537563">promises</> to be the bloodiest of Mrs Thatcher's many Cabinet reshuffles.

Threads, the core of Tootal, saw margins sliced by poor markets in the UK and US.

There is a simple solution to the problem of what to do with General Noriega. 
He should be offered the choice of political asylum in the Vatican on condition that he <tag "537527">promises</> forthwith to enter a monastic order as a novice monk, spending the rest of his life in abstinence and penitence; or he should be allowed to walk out of the papal nuncio's residence in Panama whenever he wishes.

He was met with extreme suspicion and often a rudeness that was doubtless considered patriotic, like Gary Cooper's in Hollywood.

The seven year old has done all his winning on firm ground, however, and would not want any more rain. 
Dunwoody later has prospects of a double on Spring Hay, placed behind Old Vic and Cacoethes on the Flat this season, but it may prove best to rely on one who has already had a run over hurdles, namely Robbie Burns (2.30), who showed <tag "537626">promise</> on his debut over this course and distance when running a four-length second to Tiger Claw.

McAllister was unlucky when his low drive ricocheted off Foster's foot to bounce behind off the top of the bar, but with 28 minutes gone Leicester's inexperienced central defenders Steve Walsh and Tony James were left standing by a rousing goal from Durnin. 
Stein flicked on a firm header by Ceri Evans and Durnin won the initial challenge before exploiting a yawning gap to slide a precise flick past the advancing Hodge. 
Mike Ford, a <tag "537614">promising</> left back replacement for the recently departed Jimmy Phillips, might have made it three soon afterwards as Mustoe's high lob left him unhindered in the box, but with time to control he hurriedly mistimed an awkward ball harmlessly off target.

The British made other gestures. 
In September 1941, to meet American complaints, they voluntarily issued a White Paper which laid down that no lend-lease supplies would be used for exports.

Despite a curt denial by the President of CBS News, David Burke, that the company knowingly broadcast faked combat film, Mr Rather's reputation for being the soul of integrity in the increasingly make-believe world of American television news has been damaged.

There has been a certain amount of mockery of the variations in the small print with which differing newspapers reproduced the code. 
Thus, in the field of privacy, Express Newspapers jibbed at declaring that, `Intrusion into private lives should always have a public interest justification": instead, with an audible gulp, they deleted the word `always" and inserted after the phrase `private lives" the otiose qualification `in particular those not in the public eye". 
Similarly, while all papers <tag "537527">promise</> not to `authorise payments to criminals", only three could bring themselves to extend that pledge to `their families or associates".

It was just prior to Christmas that Angie took a plane to New York leaving Zowie in the care of Marion and Daniella and having spent Christmas with friends in New York, she returned in early January to find the house empty. 
Zowie and Marion had been taken to Berlin and the story appeared in the papers a day or two later claiming that David had `snatched" Zowie because he'd been abandoned. 
Having run out of money, and not wanting to call David to ask for any, Angie got in touch with an English journalist in London saying she was ready to give her side of the story, which led to the Sunday Mirror <tag "537527">promising</> to send over cash with the reporter and photographer.

For the miscellaneous forces of the anti-government opposition, it is a time of great excitement; there is more than a hint in the air that the Gandhi magic is fading, and that the family that has controlled the government of India for all but a few years since independence has been poorly served by Jawaharlal Nehru's grandson, Rajiv. 
As the 45-year-old Prime Minister has stumbled, his government tainted by corruption, there has grown a damaging sense of unfulfilled <tag "537626">promise</>, and the cruel certainty that the adulation Rajiv Gandhi aroused in the aftermath of his mother's assassination five years ago has been lost, never to be regained.

For example, IBM's Federal Systems Division has used mathematics to produce systems which are developed well within budget and contain an order of magnitude less errors than comparable software using other methods. 
But the key to this success is that the staff who carry out the mathematical development are highly qualified, mathematically literate and undergo extensive training. 
However, the rapid introduction of a mathematics-based standard will lead to problems which will give an extremely <tag "537614">promising</> technique a bad name, and put the cause of formal method back by decades.

None the less, the White House has pressed and pressed the issue, rejecting Democratic offers to put the tax cut aside and return to it once the 1990 budget, including the Polish and Hungarian aid, is dealt with.

People embraced and wept, <tag "537527">promising</> to stay in touch, only to realise in some cases that they had no addresses to exchange.   

800175
Only private savings of up to 2,000 East German marks will be bought out at a rate of one to one. 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government is likely to announce later this week that it has accepted the Bundesbank proposal which gives East Germans a much less favourable exchange rate than they were <tag "537527">promised</> during the election campaign. 

800176

There will be a special interest in the display of <tag "537614">promising</> scrum half Stuart Cassidy, who is forging his career with Wasps.

The shares rose 7p to 724p. 
BRITISH Gas shares jumped 7p to 201 1/2 p on a higher than expected rise in its interim dividend and a <tag "537566">promise</> to increase the payout ratio over the next few years.

The peace settlement was not the dividing issue. 
The election was fought around Lloyd George &dash. his past record and his <tag "537566">promises</> for the future.

There were no peas and tomatoes to sell to pay for the children's school fees this year. 
The families are also much closer to the border, well in range of the Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo) rebel movement, which has killed at least 350 civilians along Zimbabwe's eastern border in the past two years. 
Before President Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union (Zanu-PF) government took power in 1980 <tag "537527">promising</> land reform, 6,000 mostly white commercial farmers owned the best half of the country's farming land, while 800,000 black families crowded into the remainder.   

800184
Her words were all the more remarkable because they co-existed with an approach to German unification and the evolving role of Nato and the Warsaw Pact which yielded little of substance to President Gorbachev's alternative vision &dash. even as both leaders amicably shared a press conference platform before their banquet. 
Mrs Thatcher made no reference to Boris Yeltsin, the new president of the Russian Republic, and did not seek to see him, although she did meet Moscow's newly-elected mayor, Gavrill Popov, his ally in demanding faster economic change. 
She also warned that honest politicians could not <tag "537527">promise</> the goods and services which only people could provide by adopting `the spirit to succeed".

It is people of this class who are now fleeing Hong Kong in droves. 
When the enclave returns to Chinese rule, it will do so on similar terms to those promised for Hong Kong, with Peking guaranteeing that a capitalist system and lifestyle will be maintained for at least 50 years. 
But despite those <tag "537566">promises</>, and despite Portugal's generosity, a recent public opinion survey showed that about 50 per cent of Macao residents had no confidence in the future under Chinese rule."   

800186
The under 13 girls team included six Banbury girls Laura Smith, Debbie Kukanis, Leigh Hubbard, Emma Manley, Claire Moore and Jodie Lester. 
Oxford City's talented sisters Caroline and Elizabeth Penny, also highly <tag "537614">promising</> thrower Mary Pitt, Radley's Alison Taylor and Headington Harriers duo Lisa Wise and Michelle Meads completed the line-up.

`If you were the Home Secretary himself I wouldn't do it." 
Apparently she was waiting for some show of defiance, and when Loring merely returned her look meekly, she lost some of her asperity and said, `I'll make enquiries but I can't <tag "537527">promise</> anything.   

800188
One such derivative right is the right to make a conditional promise. 
Two kinds of conditional promises are of interest here: First a promise made conditional on an action by the promisee (e.g., `I will give you ten pounds if you give me the book"). 
Second (which is in fact a special case of the above), a <tag "537566">promise</> made conditional on a promise to be given by the promisee (e.g., `I will give you ten pounds if you promise to give me the book"). 

800189
It has increased the number of seats by three to 18 and will require that the MPs vote for at least three women. 
LABOUR delegates were warned yesterday that the party would lack electoral credibilty if it <tag "537527">promised</> increases in public spending which could only be met by higher borrowing or taxes.

Talking to her book-interviewees about their expectations, Anne found that `they all wanted very different things, and it seemed absurd that they were going to have to squodge into an institution which assumed we're all precisely the same. 
Many said they couldn't see any sense, in a sexually unstable world, in <tag "537527">promising</> to be faithful for life when life might mean 50 years. 

800191
Labour does not need a commitment to proportional representation in order to scoop most of the centre ground at the next general election. 
All it needs is to <tag "537527">promise</> a high-powered investigation, such as a Royal Commission, into the practicalities of an alternative voting system (surely justified by the intense public interest now abounding). 

800192
The United States and Soviet Russia had imposed an unwelcome strategy on Great Britain. 
Back in Cairo, the Americans agreed not to insist on an operation in the Indian Ocean, even though Roosevelt had <tag "537527">promised</> it to Chiang Kai-shek, now that they had got their way in regard to Overlord.   

800193
This is cold-blooded business indeed, just as was the Balfour Decla- ration of 1917 that gave Britain's support to a Jewish homeland providing that `nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine". 
The equally earnest Anglo-French Declaration of 1918 <tag "537527">promising</> the Arabs of former Ottoman colonies their independence if they supported the Allies against the Turks fell into much the same category, although it was not a promise that was intended to be kept. 

800194
To say that the Prime Minister was mobbed by a vast and adoring crowd is like saying that a glimpse of the Popemobile arouses the passing interest of Latino peasantry. 
The crowd was so ecstatic that the hard men of the Special Branch and KGB turned the <tag "537625">promised</> walk-about into a bus-about rather than risk a Tory leadership contest.   

800195
Law, a Canadian, promised `tranquillity" ; Astor, an American, made The Times once more respectable &dash. and `stodgy" . 
The New World had been called in to redress the morality of the old.

Now he has rejoined the Kidlington-based Jaguar sports car team, and will probably only return to Formula One if he is certain of driving a car which would give him a chance of challenging at the top. 
It could be a disappointing end to a career which began with so much <tag "537626">promise</> in 1984, when Brundle joined Tyrrell after a neck-and-neck race with Ayrton Senna for the Formula Three championship.   

800199
More than 100,000 spectators crowded on to bridges to watch re-enactments of the German invasion, de Gaulle's flight to London, D-Day and the liberation, and the bombing raids when France fell. 
NEIL KINNOCK last night promised that 14 out of every 15 working people would pay no more income tax under Labour and that families earning #20,000-plus would suffer only marginal net increases, if any. 
`We do not want a level of taxation which is going to depress effort," the Labour leader said after <tag "537527">promising</> an unsentimental approach to public spending.  

800200
Objection should not be objection by implication or common usage. 
Objection within section 102(2)(d) was unqualified, and need not be buttressed by a <tag "537566">promise</> to make a submission of `no case to answer".   

800201
Mr Mugabe issued a strong warning to ZUM and other potential opponents who hope to challenge the new party in next year's general elections. 
`Whilst we <tag "537527">promise</> you a fair fight, the defeat we are certain to inflict upon you will be so massive and crippling that you will not rise again," he said.  

800202
Given the happenings of the last few weeks &dash. first the tens of thousands who flooded out of the country through the newly opened back doors, and now the even more vocal opposition, which is determined to stay &dash. it would be understandable if few of East Germany's Communists are keen to put themselves in Mr Honecker's shoes. 
His does not look like a job with a <tag "537614">promising</> future.   

800203
Within hours of taking over on Wednesday from the hardline Erich Honecker as the country's leader, Egon Krenz indicated that the government recognised that it had made mistakes. 
`All of us can feel the tears of the many mothers and fathers," he said, <tag "537527">promising</> to address the issues that had led to the exodus.   

800204
FOUR months after its management buy-out, Minty Design Furniture of Cowley is announcing a new range, has given its collection a new identity and brought out a new catalogue. 
It is calling the range Country House Collection, and <tag "537527">promises</> an increased fabric selection.   

800205
However it isn't easy to get reliable information on what to give, and when. 
Most people end up relying upon the colourful packets, tins and jars of commercial baby foods, which at least <tag "537563">promise</> lots of vitamins and no longer have added salt, sugar, colours or artificial flavours.   

800206
Get the crew together for a de-briefing over mugs of coffee. 
Some are already preparing for the next flight, one referees a football match for the passengers and another has left for a course on `coping with turbulence". 
Remind crew that they have <tag "537527">promised</> to return later to meet the passengers and their relatives for an open evening and that tomorrow is the jumble sale to raise funds for the on-board computer.

Souness's hopes of financing the deal by selling two players to Dundee for a package worth #450,000 seem to have disappeared. 
Scott Nisbet, a central defender, has rejected a move to the premier division's bottom club, although the midfield player Ian McCall has <tag "537527">promised</> to give Dundee an answer shortly after discussing terms with their manager, Gordon Wallace, this afternoon.

What is contentious is whether Brook is more than a great conjuror. 
It is conceivable that audiences at the nine-hour live Mahabharata did experience something of Ganesha's <tag "537527-a">promised</> transformation.   

800209
While the Communist Party retreats into Marxist obscurantism on the mainland, the Kuomintang has made the stockmarket the core of its own mandate to rule the self-styled Republic of China, gingerly experimenting at the same time with political reform of the type crushed by tanks in Tiananmen Square. 
With only two days to go before Taiwan holds its first legislative elections with more than just one legal party, the Kuomintang has pegged its fortunes, even legitimacy, to the share index. 
When the campaign began just over a week ago, it <tag "537527">promised</> voters `good profits and a long bull run", which seemed a safe enough pledge.   

800210
Mozambique is also short of the means to move emergency supplies. 
In its April appeal, the government asked for $63 million for trucks, boats, and airlifts, but only $3.2 million has been <tag "537527">promised</>.   

800211
Under the terms of the Act of Union of 1800, Irish peers were given the right to elect 28 of their number to represent them in the House of Lords. 
The last of the 28 Representatives died in 1961, and, on 17 July 1971 (Gold Cup Day in the middle of Ascot Week), the Statute Law (Repeals) Act was passed to cancel the provisions which conferred on the peers of Ireland their right of representation, and to abolish the Steam Engine Furnaces Act of 1821. 
I have no particular quarrel with the latter part of the Act, but I would point out that under Part 1, a <tag "538412">promise</> given at the Union of 1800 was broken, and a precedent set for depriving hereditary peers of their constitutional rights.   

800212
The state-run ADN news agency said 20,000 people marched in Neubrandenburg, and tens of thousands in Frankfurt an der Oder. 
WITH Greece's general election on Sunday <tag "537527">promising</> either a very narrow overall majority for the New Democracy conservatives or perhaps for a fragile left-wing alliance, Western diplomats have grown concerned by the country's accumulation of pressing economic and foreign policy problems.   

800213
Our Lady of the Snows was full of gilded pouting angels, but despite the heavy rain I was the only visitor, devout or otherwise. 
St Michael's Church &dash. `a gem of Baroque Moravian architecture" &dash. was firmly shut and St Wenceslas Cathedral, founded in 1109 and rebuilt at the end of the last century on a vast neo-Gothic scale, was dark, impressive and so cold inside it made your head ache. 
In front of the church of St Maurice I met Lenka, a music student who had <tag "537527">promised</> to show me what she described as `the biggest organ in Central Europe", all 2,311 pipes of it, the largest more than thirty feet tall, the smallest eight millimetres of solid silver.

It was announced that Ribbentrop, the German foreign minister, had been invited to Moscow. 
On 23 August he and Molotov signed the Nazi &dash. Soviet pact. 
Soviet Russia <tag "537527">promised</> to stay neutral if Germany were involved in war; there were also secret clauses limiting the gains which the Germans could make in Poland.   

800215
It is not completely comfortable to be reminded that Mr Kinnock's public positions on a number of issues, from Party democracy to the Bomb have changed remarkably since he was a mere contender for the leadership. 
Lloyd's main concern, however, is to beat down the dismissive intellectual snobs (who used to say even nastier things about that other middle-brow, Clement Attlee) and to argue that, though the Labour leader is steering the Party in a <tag "537614">promising</> direction, there is still a long way to go.

How had a Conservative Government happened? 
Where were the golden days which Paris and Chicago and Grosvenor Square had <tag "537563">promised</> them?

The chase films swept away by this development may have been repetitive but they offered an excitement that no one can have secured from the sight of London stage actors running through potted silent versions of Shakespeare. 
Slightly more <tag "537614">promising</> as a source of cinematic entertainment were the melodramatic novels to which Barker and others turned for narrative material. 

800218
That is one would not have chosen that now if it were a fresh choice, but given the amount `invested" in the goal already it is now best to continue with it. 
For example: `When I was young I wanted to be a doctor, for medicine looked such a <tag "537614">promising</> profession.

The insurance group, for 20 years a loyal Morgan Grenfell shareholder, has delivered its crucial 20.4 per cent holding into the hands of one of the most aggressive financial institutions in Europe, one that had already amassed 4.4 per cent of Morgan Grenfell before yesterday's events.

To find out whether the later episodes live up to the <tag "537626">promise</> of the opener we shall have to wait until the series is transmitted towards the end of next year, but in the meantime, Lynch's pilot is released by Warner Home Video on 8 December.

Mr Fowler meanwhile reiterated the claim that the implementation of the charter, through the action programme, would result in job losses.

Between these amusing set pieces, unfortunately, came some extended chunks of old jazzers and jossers (Frankie Laine, Tito Puente and club-owner Maz Gordon) rambling on about the golden days, and while these were doubtless blissful for aficionados, they became a shade tedious for the unconverted.

For this sad state of affairs there are several explanations, including the improved accuracy of passers and the increased use of eight-man defensive fronts. 
But I suspect that the desire for instant gratification which the pass <tag "537563">promises</> is also a factor.

It must be remembered that Coole was Robert's property and, since his marriage, his mother was merely his guest there. 
Margaret Gregory now poured out her woes to Lady Dunsany: Lady Gregory had <tag "537527">promised</> that, when her son married, Yeats would cease to live at Coole for `most of the year"; he still occupied the master of the house's bedroom; he was indifferent to Lady Gregory's opinion, knowing she would always forgive him in the end, and had no shame about staying on, even though he knew Robert and Margaret disliked his presence.

Andrew &dash. `I don't want to kick the ball in the air all day, but you have to use the elements" &dash. pinned Park down, but the finishing touch was markedly absent, with one glorious exception.

`It's part of our gold service, and helps mark the card out," says the bank. 
PENSIONERS are at the mercy of unscrupulous financial advisers who <tag "537527">promise</> a painless way to boost the elderly's meagre income by using their home as security. 

800262
When the inevitable differential movement occurs between the two skins, it is common for rupturing of the bonding bricks to occur because they are brittle and possibly perforated to facilitate good drainage of the cavity. 
Differential movements between the facing and the backing brickwork can be better accommodated by the tolerance of bending or rotation which is a quality of the metal ties that were universally adopted when the shortcomings of bonding bricks became apparent. 
However, the type of tie which was almost invariably used &dash. namely the galvanised steel wire `butterfly" tie &dash. is intrinsically flimsy and lacks the long-term corrosion resistance <tag "537527">promised</> by its galvanised finish (Fig 22).   

800263
Those who do not voluntarily or semi-voluntarily place themselves under the authority of relatively just governments are under a partial and qualified obligation to recognize the authority of such a government in their country. 
In particular its authority should be recognized to the extent necessary to enable it to secure goals, which individuals have reason to secure, for which social co-ordination is necessary or helpful, and where this is the most <tag "537614">promising</> way of achieving them.   

800264
It is easy to criticise what has been achieved so far. 
In two years everyone would have a proper home, the Soviet Prime Minister, Nikolai Ryzhkov, once <tag "537527">promised</>.

Any changes in the voting system would not come into effect before the next elections to the Volkskammer (Parliament) in 1991. 
Mr Krenz professed to be unruffled by the mass rallies &dash. a `good sign" of what he called the popular desire for changes `to make life in East Germany better still". 
He <tag "537527">promised</> `a dialogue of different opinions", and that all suggestions would be assessed on their merits, provided they did not challenge Socialism itself, or the leading role of the SED.

The church source described the negotiations as `very delicate". 
He said the Panamanian officers would be given either safe passage to a third country or <tag "537566">promises</> of light sentences in Panama.

Well, it has taken just eight years. 
It needed Gorbachev &dash. both his example and the <tag "537566">promise</> that he would not use his tanks to crush movements of East European emancipation. 

800271
As regards this latter class of contracts, the Infants' Relief Act 1874 very much altered the law. 
Contracts for the loan of money and supply of goods to infants and `accounts stated" with infants were made altogether void, while the possibility of ratification was taken away from all those contracts which required ratification to make them binding upon him after attaining full age; and even a new <tag "537566">promise</> to perform the contract, whether made upon a fresh consideration or not, could not be enforced by action.

Having been <tag "537527">promised</> that I could be a page or a Herald, (depending on whether I could learn to play the trumpet), and watch him come out on top of Lincoln Cathedral, I was bitterly disappointed when my mother took his trousers away and called in the doctor.

No one is saying that Sea Containers" alternative proposals are worth a lot more than dollars 70." 
The new offer will appeal to arbitrageurs, believed to hold up to 30 per cent of Sea Containers common stock, who invested heavily after Mr Sherwood <tag "537527">promised</> his plan would give stockholders between dollars 70 and dollars 100 a share.

The Dean Street All Stars Ever since its formation, the Pizza Express All Stars have been a big attraction both in their home venue and at clubs and festivals around the country. 
Now Mr Boizot's emporium has spawned another group, this time with more modern stylistic inclinations, and including some of the brightest new faces on the scene. 
The impressive and remarkably versatile saxophonist Alan Barnes is the leader, alongside the similarly ubiquitous Dave O'Higgins and highly <tag "537614">promising</> young trumpeter Gerard Presencer. 

800276
Other intellectual stimulation came from his membership of an undergraduate society called the Martlets, a group that met once a week in term-time to discuss a subject of common interest and hear one of their members read a paper. 
An essay which particularly took Lewis's fancy was one on the poetry of Henry Newbolt, read by a man called Basil Wyllie. 
`I hadn't thought the subject very <tag "537614">promising</> but he quoted a great many good things I hadn't known &dash. especially a queer little song about grasshoppers."

Frelimo might make partial concessions on all three points if it really means an end to the war. 
But memories remain of the Nkomati Accord in 1984, when South Africa <tag "537527">promised</> to stop backing the MNR and instead stepped up support. 

800279
Fate had thrown us together! 
As he left, clutching my documentation, he said: `Adrian, during the week we are in Moscow do you <tag "537527">promise</>, swear, give me your word, that you will not utter one word about the Norwegian leather industry?"   

800280
The condition is an act of the promisor and his obligation is conditional on his action because it is desirable that he should be able to bind himself if he so wishes. 
It follows that people's interest in being able to bind themselves is the basis of a power to promise which they possess and of an obligation to keep promises they make. 
But neither the power nor the obligation point to a right to <tag "537527">promise</>. 

800281
It should be taken much more seriously." 
The East German government has <tag "537527">promised</> to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions 30 per cent by 1993 and, as part of the new glasnost sweeping the administration, it now publishes air pollution figures in national newspapers.   

800282
For this alone Invisible Cities deserved its British premiere (the first performance took place earlier this year in The Hague). 
But the <tag "537625">promised</> rock influences fail to generate much excitement, and one waits in vain for the memorable, the surprising, the irresistible inspiration which would persuade one to go out and crusade on the music's behalf. 

800283
The water strike of l983 revived interest. 
The Tory manifesto of that general election year again <tag "537527">promised</> action to enforce `adequate procedure agreements" in essential services, but the idea was again shelved in favour of action on union democracy.

Tracing the dollars on an international basis has been an issue from day one. 
Israel presents a bill-cum-claim for #13 billion; the Turks have already been more than vigilant and need recompense; Egypt is already forgiven its #7 billion arms debt but needs more; Syria has had its funds unblocked by the EC; the US is getting its war subsidies; the Soviet Union is tied by its need for help; the air is thick with pay-offs and <tag "537566">promises</>, massive promises every one of which has its own complex politics contradicting most or all of the others.  

800285
The Dutch might have scored in the first minute, when Ronald Koeman's long, lofted through pass caught the Brazilians' five-man defence square and Frank Berghuis spurned an inviting chance to give his debut the most memorable of starts. 
It was a <tag "537614">promising</> opening but it proved to be a case of promise unfulfilled.   

800286
The patients did not seem at all grateful to see me or appreciative of my little jokes about the `horse power" of the bus. 
I <tag "537527">promised</> to return on Wednesday.

`Friedel" comes careering through the door with an axe in its hand, before forgetting what it was so angry about in the first place, while `Liebeslied" is the sort of directionless tosh that gives experimentalism a bad name. 
That leaves `Virus-Bub", which momentarily <tag "537563">promises</> to perform minor miracles, but ultimately comes across like a Killing Joke tribute to Gregory Isaacs.

Britannia &dash. The Film, however, is in only eight parts.

800292
So he made a go of permanently avoiding the issue. 
Even though the new series looks good (with one of its highlights <tag "537563">promising</> to be the small-screen debut of Paul Whitehead) and he has at least three other projects on the go, Harry Enfield still hasn't figured out what it is that he does exactly.  

800294
John Kerridge, Fisons' chairman and chief executive, said that Fisons had a record of growing at about 20 per cent per annum. 
`The VG deal is a step forward in the growth pattern," he said, pointing out that the group had <tag "537527">promised</> it would enhance earnings with last year's purchase of Pennwalt, and had exceeded that prediction.

Well for the first few days I found enough energy to take an occasional dip in the pool and play a leisurely game of bowls.

But `Lula's" Workers' Party supporters still feel cheated of victory, blaming biased media coverage and Mr Collor's questionable campaign tactics. 
To tackle the economic crisis, Mr Collor is expected to create two `super-ministries" headed by businessmen, who will implement his four <tag "537625">promised</> reforms to the groaning bureaucracy.

Consent can adversely affect the normative situation of the agent either by placing him under an obligation or by derogating from his rights. 
One can waive one's rights by consenting, but not by <tag "537527">promising</> (except in the special case in which the very undertaking of an obligation to act in a certain way terminates one's right not to do so).

But in East Germany, the abolition of the system brought with it &dash. with apparent inevitability &dash. the abolition of not just a system, but of a country. 
East Germany's old Communist leaders had themselves always insisted that the country has no rationale beyond its different political system. 
The most optimistic prediction might be that a new multi-party system, after the already <tag "537527">promised</> free elections next year, would delay for a few years &dash. perhaps until a subsequent set of elections &dash. the immediate question of German unity.

Shirley Temple lived her childhood in the open; Temple was the juvenilia; the fuller life followed later. 
But the writers patiently gathered in Neville Braybrooke's Seeds in the Wind, fully formed literary grown-ups, have acquired retrospective childhoods; their early writing <tag "537563">promises</> a sneak preview of their more mature productions.

and we know that St Aldates had to pay #280, which  along with All Saints, the city church, was the highest  amount from all the various parishes. 
And then there was money for maimed soldiers, for what they  called visited persons, which was the plague, fire and  candles for the courts of guards,  that was paying for fire and candles for all the little  sentinel posts round Oxford.

We're told the brochure undersells; but we like delivering holidays which are better than expected. 
Most booking conditions are hedged with all sorts of exclusions about why a tour operator can't be held liable when things go wrong.

MR CHARLES Haughey began another round of crisis meetings with other parties last night after a 90-minute session of the Dail gave him a further three days to put together a government. 
Put on to the defensive by sustained opposition attacks, Mr Haughey agreed that calling another election would be a `Doomsday solution", but, after being berated by deputies for his anti-coalition stance, he <tag "537527">promised</> as many discussions as possible.

Mr Wijeratne said that all news stories would have to be approved by a censor before publication, including those of the foreign media. 
`You are cautioned that if you act in an irresponsible manner I will cancel your visas and deport you," he told the news conference. 
Answering a suggestion that the President, Mr Ranasinghe Premadasa, may face criticism for not upholding the freedom of the press as <tag "537527">promised</> in his election manifesto, Mr Wijeratne replied: `Who cares what the critics say when subversives are trying to topple the government.

This might be the prelude to any adapted stage play, a stimulating montage before the proscenium arch is fitted over the screen. 
But, although most of the rest of the film, until its chase finale, is played out within one house, where the lodger's strange behaviour arouses suspicions of his guilt, Hitchcock's interest in using the details of daily life to build anticipation and stir emotion ensures that the action never seems confined. 
With good cause did Kine Weekly subsequently hail the film for giving ` <tag "538412">promise</> of a genuine reaction against the deeply-rooted Wardour Street superstition that America will only buy pictures similar to her own."

It made good copy and helped with the film's publicity; they also gave an insight into what others thought of Nicholson and the way he saw himself, then. 
He played Bobby Dupea with explosive sensitivity, as a <tag "537614">promising</> musician who rejects a career to become an oil-rigger; a rebel who, like Nicholson himself, had the chance of taking a particular course in life which would have provided him with comfort and stability, but chose a different route to that which might have been expected of him.

In the first free presidential elections for 29 years the Brazilians have now voted, exuberantly but without violence, for the candidate who seems marginally the more likely to salvage the country from economic chaos. 
The choice for the electorate of 82 million was commendably clear: on the centre right, Fernando Collor de Mello, a charismatic sprig of the elite oligarchy committed to opening up the economy, reducing state intervention and fighting corruption; on the left, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, a bearded trade unionist <tag "537527">promising</> land reform, a fairer distribution of wealth, and strong central planning.

Four of the 62 Knesset members who had been expected to back the Likud in this afternoon's Knesset vote of confidence warned yesterday that they might not do so because of Mr Shamir's refusal to give them ministerial jobs. 
Of the four, three are members of small factions allied with the Likud, and the fourth is Avraham Sharir, a former Liberal Party leader who left the Likud to join the Labour Party and returned to the Likud with the promise of becoming a minister. 
Mr Shamir told them yesterday that he could not keep his <tag "538409">promise</> to give them the jobs they wanted, but hoped they would nevertheless back him.

The proposal has a long pedigree enjoying support within both the Institute of Directors and the Centre for Policy Studies. 
The Tories at the 1979 general election <tag "537527">promised</> that industrial action in essential services would be restricted, but a subsequent green paper killed the idea, saying that existing legal provisions, such as the 1875 Conspiracy Act, had been little used and that workers in most key industries had exercised restraint, and pleading difficulties in defining the relevant groups of workers.

We want the zone extended to 200 miles."

This was a sweeping commitment, though one already laid down in the Covenant; strictly, it made Great Britain, along with the other signatories, guarantor of every frontier in Europe, if not all over the world.

Mr Shamir desparately wants to avoid the fate which befell his Labour Party rival, Shimon Peres, in April.

Six colonies developed their own proud practices. 
It was not until the 1880s that intercolonial connections were made, and the stations which connected them became important not only as points of break of gauge, and therefore of journey for passengers, but also as customs centres. 
In 1901 West Australia was enticed into the new Commonwealth with the promise of a transcontinental line, just as British Columbia had been persuaded to join the Canadian Confederation with railway <tag "537566">promises</>.

Faintly, very faintly, he had heard the car zig-zagging through the lanes. 
In the wake of her desertion he had set aside Richard Crane and the new book, and he had written to David Gerrard requesting a meeting to discuss what was left of his <tag "537614">promising</> career.   

800347
The economy is beset by a swollen public sector, rampant corruption and heavy dependence on illegal coca earnings. 
Mr Vargas Llosa <tag "537527">promises</> to restructure the state, privatise all state companies, take personal charge of the anti-subversive war and bring inflation down to 10 per cent within a year.

Yet even the Ferrari driver has only a win and a second place out of seven races so far in a season which has seen British hopes plunge because of injury and recalcitrant machinery. 
Going into tomorrow's British Grand Prix at Silverstone, Derek Warwick is struggling to recover from back injuries sustained in a karting accident, Martin Brundle seeks to revive the momentum of an initially <tag "537614">promising</> season marred by his failure to pre-qualify in the last two races, and Johnny Herbert is on the sidelines, pondering on what might have been.

And then hangs himself from a bloody chandelier?" 
Over the next few minutes Rain outlined what she knew about Alf Wilson and she <tag "537527">promised</> to tell his cousin anything else she learned.

AN UNEMPLOYED man began a sustained assault on his five-year-old daughter Sukina after she refused to spell her name for him, Bristol Crown Court was told yesterday. 
The beating, by David Hammond, with a ruler, plastic tubing, fists and a kettle flex resulted in her death from multiple injuries, the prosecution alleged. 
The girl's mother, Patricia Kent, told the court how Mr Hammond had <tag "537563">promised</> the two eldest of his three children sweets, if they spelt their names.   

800354
Around 23,500 have left by this route since Friday.

He said: `We need to press the Soviets to move as quickly as possible." 
Underlying Mr Cheney's remarks is the alarm that deep cuts in US defence spending will cause in western Europe unless Nato and the Warsaw Pact have already signed a CFE treaty, which they hope to do in autumn 1990. 
Mr Cheney <tag "537527">promised</> that the United States would `consult" its allies before making reductions in its forces based in Europe.   

800357
ROBERT PONSONBY's full and sympathetic notice of Sir John Pritchard (6 December) may perhaps be supplemented by a further note on his early life, writes George A. Barnard. 
His father was one of those many musicians who lost their livelihood when the cinema was invaded by the `talkies" so that Pritchard, as he was known at the Sir George Monoux Grammar School, Walthamstow, grew up from the age of 10 in severely straitened circumstances. 
None the less his parents saw to it that his obvious musical <tag "537626">promise</> was cultivated at a remarkable private music school run by a Miss Geary, and he received further encouragement at school from two outstanding teachers, LC Belchamber and Harry Hyde.   

800358
It was unlikely that they would find another opportunity before he left. 
`Oh Nevil!" It was now that she came closest to breaking her <tag "538410">promise</> and begging him to change his mind and stay.

No answer had yet been received from the WODC about collection of refuse in St Mary's church path &dash. this has been discontinued since the school was finished and houses built. 
The attention of the parish council was drawn to a second access at The Willows in Trots Lane which had been refused by the planning department &dash. this had been allowed by the Oxfordshire county council's highways department and Dr Ware <tag "537527">promised</> to look into the matter.

Many people and organisations have already given us money and many more have either organised an event and are in the process of collecting in all the proceeds, or, have organised events to be held in the near future. 
I want everyone to know that we are well on the way to reaching our target of #10,550 and with the finance already <tag "537527">promised</> we are now in a position to order the equipment.   

800362
How will the fifty-thousand-and-first person in that queue feel?" 
Mr Kaufman, repeatedly cheered by Tory backbenchers, <tag "537527">promised</> if the scheme was embodied in an Act, an incoming Labour government would examine how far it had gone and how it was working.   

800363
Such a consequence seems at odds with the conventions of discourse concerning promises. 
I therefore favour a second view (which complements the first) according to which each person has an interest that promises made to him will be kept. 
Of course, he might lose interest in the specific content of some <tag "537566">promises</>, and keeping some of them may even work against his overall interest. 

800364
The opposition are by no means confident that the military leadership will hand over power once the results are through. 
They've <tag "537527">promised</> to do so as soon as a new constitution has been written, but western diplomats say that could take up to two years.   

800365
The Law Society added that it would press for improvements to the clauses that open up probate work to banks, building societies and insurance companies to give better protection for executors and beneficiaries. 
Lord Mackay said that county courts, in particular in the South-east, had faced staff turnover problems, but he <tag "537527">promised</> improvements.   

800366
Empire hopes that access to La Redoute's technology in direct selling will help it build up this operation, which mail order people hope will compensate for the decline of agency business. 
But Mr Gratwick <tag "537527">promised</> that there would be no dramatic moves.   

800367
In 1982 and 1983, with barely more than two officers to cover the region, the council was quite unable to devote the kind of time required to make special site designation acceptable on West Sedgemoor. 
In addition, it had not been provided  with the financial details which would have enabled it to make precise <tag "538411">promises</> to landowners on what kind of money they would be offered in compensation for profits foregone under the terms of the Act.   

800368
The Government promised that no rate-payer would have to pay more than #3 per week extra under the Poll Tax. 
The pledge would be fulfilled through a system of transitional relief operating in the first year of the Poll Tax, said local government minister Mr David Hunt. 
But his <tag "538411">promise</> was made on the assumption that councils would hold their Poll Taxes below Government targets.

In West Bengal it was 18 already. 
Mr Gandhi has also been <tag "537527">promising</> greater devolution of power to the villages.

For those less inclined to believe that successful performance can be programmed on a mere dietary regime, the good news is that this Marriage Of Figaro has some handsome voices, is conducted by Rattle like many other fine Figaros, and boasts a beautiful atmospheric-looking last act. 
Designed by John Gunter with evocative lighting by Paul Pyant, this moonlit garden scene has neoclassical pavilions of Mars and Venus on either side of the stage below looming cypresses, a little mound of butcher's grass like an overgrown flowerbed set in flagstones at the front, and way upstage a distant view of Aguas frescas, Count Almaviva's mansion, nestling like Glyndebourne itself under a hilly horizon with lights burning in its windows. 
There's even the blinding firework display the Count <tag "537527">promises</> at the end to send everybody (especially the producer Peter Hall who in 1973 had to make do with sparklers) away joyful.   

800373
The Policy Review document proposes a larger stride back to the unpopular past than many people expected. 
It suggests re-legalising secondary action provided the workers in question have `a genuine interest" in the main dispute: waffly phrase, sending shudders up the spine. 
It would also appear to <tag "537527">promise</> that all effective sanctions will be removed which impose on unions an incentive to obey the law.   

800374
Thus, as a cabinet minister recently explained it, those in the `open group" will be able to elect their own political representatives, as will those in the white group, the black group, the so-called Coloured group, the Asian group, and any other groups that might subsequently emerge. 
The open residential, or `free settlement", areas will lay the foundation, the government plans, for the new political dispensation Mr de Klerk persistently <tag "537527">promises</>.

Other products of the skiffle world were recruited, re-styled, re-named and launched by managers like Kennedy and his partner, Larry Parnes: among them Marty Wilde (really Reg Smith), Adam Faith (Terry Nelhams) and Cliff Richard (Harry Webb). 
Parnes played house-mother in his flat to a stableful of hopefuls whose names, at least, were a <tag "537573">promise</> of highly-strung temperaments: Marty Wilde, Billy Fury, Johnny Gentle, Vince Eager and so on.   

800377
(Again I avoid examining the way these duties are qualified.) 
Violation of the duty not to interfere with a person's promising will frustrate his right to promise and the interest on which it is base, either by preventing the person from exercising his rights or by perverting the considerations on which he decides whether to promise or not. 
The fact that such interferences with the right are infrequent is reflected by the fact that the right to <tag "537527">promise</> is rarely invoked in ordinary practical discourse. 

800378
The Scots restored some pride by hitting back with three goals &dash. from Mixu Paatelainen (42), Michael O'Neill (61) and John Clark (89). 
RUGBY UNION received one <tag "537566">promise</> of more than #30m yesterday and made another less cast-iron pledge that the sport would remain amateur.

If nothing else, the elections will serve as the best poll to test the strength of the Islamic current in Jordan. 
IRAQ yesterday <tag "537527">promised</> to allow British officials in Baghdad to visit Farzad Bazoft, the Observer journalist arrested on 15 September after trying to investigate the mystery explosion at an arms factory which killed hundreds. 

800380
The visitor was much troubled by the slum-life he fleetingly observed from the rear window of his limousine and said he was shocked by the rude contrast between these `two Venezuelas". 
He <tag "537527">promised</> bemused correspondents that he would return within a year, shake off his heavy security and don high heels and a wig to visit the barrios unobserved. 

800381
As Henry Lee, one of Locke's critics, put it, such 
For this reason, many in the seventeenth century would have said that such knowledge, together with knowledge of undoubted moral principles, such as that <tag "538409">promises</> should be kept, is innate.

What must be going through this man's mind, when he plays a scene with a parrot named Gigi? 
Perhaps a <tag "537566">promise</> to scatter roses on the grave of Vincente Minnelli, who directed him in the film of that name. 

800383
But your success with the raw material which I am placing at your disposal will depend greatly on your being a woman because our Marshal of the American Union was sent away from his mother by his mother when he was five years old which brought him an ineradicable sense of unworthiness and made him lust for the approval of all women. 
Indeed, because his father was scorned by his mother, because his father was a ruined cocaine addict, the Marshal was forced to feel that everyone found him unworthy. 
By leading him to the altar of television, you will be consecrating his loss and <tag "537527">promising</> him redemption from his unworthiness."   

800384
`It'll be safe, you don't have to worry about that," Susan assured her. 
Maggie sat at the table, thinking that she didn't know about the proposed camp but couldn't wait to get at the <tag "537625">promised</> bathing facilities.   

800385
Indications of the purchase price of each building were obtained and full funding proposals were prepared. 
Although conversion of each of the first three buildings considered was potentially viable, all three failed one or more tests of the practicality/viability analysis. 
When Granby House came on to the market early in 1983, it looked more <tag "537614">promising</>.

However, officers of the Central Intelligence Organisation re-detained Mr Tsvangirai moments after he had left police custody. 
The Attorney-General had <tag "537527">promised</> to take the matter to cabinet, his lawyers said.   

800387
That process was marked by a string of person-to-person meetings, many of them arranged in the strictest secrecy. 
Sir Nigel Broackes, chairman of Trafalgar House, reported yesterday that turnover rose 21 per cent to #3.2bn last year and <tag "537527 or 537584">promised</> a similar return next time.   

800388
Earlier, Dave McCullouch stated that, although this was always the case, it didn't have to be. 
The Smiths showed early <tag "537573">promise</> of breaking traditions, but failed.

Those who had supported him now received the popular vote even when, as happened with some pro-war Radicals and with Labour men who had been Coalition ministers, they did not receive the coupon. 
When Lloyd George talked of making `a fit country for heroes to live in" , his record in social legislation seemed to justify this <tag "537626">promise</>.

Levels of this chemical are disturbed during a migraine attack. 
A MOTORIST who <tag "537527">promised</> a friend he would get to the station on time drove down a platform and crashed into a train, Teesside magistrates were told yesterday.   

800391
In the debate itself, some of the behind-the-scenes tensions were reflected by party spokesmen attempting to discredit Mr Benn's contribution, pointing out that he had served in Labour governments which maintained nuclear weapons. 
In spite of the setback on the defence spending vote, Mr Kinnock later scored a further advance with the results of the national executive elections, which saw Ken Livingstone replaced by John Prescott, the party's robust transport spokesman. 
AS SOME 3,000 East German would-be emigrants poured into West Germany's embassy in Prague yesterday, the East Germans, apparently furious at the latest development, accused West Germany of `gross breach of trust", claiming that Bonn had <tag "537527">promised</> to stop the flow.   

800392
These words will be more than welcome to the Kremlin, as it uneasily watches the astonishing course of events in East Germany, and the huge street demonstrations that increasingly demand changes which would put Communist rule of the country in question. 
Beyond repeating the <tag "537566">promise</> of freedom of travel for his citizens, Mr Krenz gave nothing away of the further reforms he has in mind, and which are likely to be set out at next week's plenum of the Central Committee of the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED). 

800393
Each new hint of change is interpreted as a sign that the leadership is running scared. 
Whenever the government attempts to placate the population with sackings or <tag "537566">promises</> of political liberalism, the numbers of demonstrators increase and the slogans become yet more radical.   

800395
FINANCIAL backing of #1bn has been raised by Intouch, one of the consortia vying for a licence to operate Britain's future mobile communications services based on personal communications networks (PCNs). 
The PCNs, designed to bring low-cost mobile communications to the masses, will rival both the cellular radio services operated by Cellnet and Vodafone and the traditional fixed telephone services provided by British Telecom and Mercury. 
Cable and Wireless, Mercury's parent, has been virtually <tag "537527">promised</> a licence and one or two more will be granted by the Government by the beginning of next year.

Small children and some mentally deranged people lack it. 
Furthermore, if it is not permissible to have bonds based on immorality, one's right to <tag "537527">promise</> does not include the right to promise to perform immoral acts.

This conclusion is supported by the replies which Michael Mu&umlaut.ller-Claudius, formerly a psychologist, received to his unique, camouflaged small sample of opinion of sixty-one Party members (all of whom had joined either the NSDAP or the Hitler Youth before 1933) in 1942. 
In response to his prompting remark that `the Jewish problem still hasn't been cleared up" and `we hear nothing at all about what sort of solution is imagined", only three Party members (5 per cent) expressed open approval of the right to exterminate the Jews, with comments such as: `The Fu&umlaut.hrer has decided upon the extermination of Jewry and <tag "537527">promised</> it.

Thus, while I ought to allow my neighbour who locked himself out of his house to use my phone, I have no duty to do so. 
On the other hand, since I have <tag "537527">promised</> my neighbour to saw off a branch overhanging a corner of his garden this week, I have a duty, and therefore I ought, to do so.  

800399
A Witney stall gave smokers every chance to give up the dreaded weed. 
Holidays in the sun, quizzes, breath tests, even financial advice &dash. it was all part of the No Smoking Day campaign yesterday. 
Witney's health visitors, helped by local schoolchildren, set up the stall in the busy Woolgate shopping centre and were hoping to get <tag "537566">promises</> to kick the habit. 

800401
After everyone present had spoken, the Russian chairperson, head of the School of Journalism at Moscow University, suggested, in his perfect English, that we break for coffee. 
We all perked up and trooped outside to the lobby. 
However, though <tag "537527">promised</>, no coffee appeared, in fact nothing appeared so we trooped back inside for the final session of that day.

Poor circulation can often result in dry flaky skin, especially on the hands and arms. 
Two of our testers, whose skin has hitherto proved unresponsive to even the most intensive of creams, have noted a dramatic improvement with Neutrogena's new Norwegian Formula Emulsion. 
A creamy glycerine-enriched lotion that smells faintly of cloves, it is easily absorbed and appears to fulfil its <tag "537566">promise</> of keeping the skin moisturised and soft for at least eight hours after application.

Without rejoining, he participates in the `Democratic Camp" of prominent leftists, former socialist dissenters and others assembled by Mr Papandreou to support Pasok, and distances himself from the party when necessary. 
He argues that a vote for the Coalition of the Left in Cephalonia is effectively a vote for New Democracy, and stresses Mr Papandreou has <tag "537527">promised</> to `act as a responsible Greek" &dash. code for `stand aside for the sake of a coalition government".

But for the moment Cooke is content that England have the player to succeed Paul Rendall. 
Cooke can also derive satisfaction from the welcome return to form of Nigel Redman at lock, from the possible emergence of Dean Ryan and Tim Rodber in the back row, from the enterprising Nigel Heslop on the wing and, despite his hesitation last Saturday against Buenos Aires, from the <tag "537566">promise</> of Gavin Thompson.

Not only of its fastnesses and vastnesses but also of the minute detailing of existence upon our own planet: its climatic patterns and the plate tectonics that give rise to earthquakes, volcanoes, fold mountains and the oceanic ridges. 
But perhaps more important, at this time when the infancy of our species must end, we have an astronaut's view of Earth rise above the horizon of the Moon to teach us that we live on a tiny island in a vast ocean of energy, space and time. 
Meanwhile the massive technological `spin-off" from the space programmes <tag "537563">promises</> to change our social and working lives completely during the next two decades.

PENSIONERS are at the mercy of unscrupulous financial advisers who promise a painless way to boost the elderly's meagre income by using their home as security. 
A helpful free booklet launched this week by Hinton &and. Wild, the specialist financial intermediaries, is designed to help pensioners come to an informed decision as to the relative advantages, disadvantages, and possible dangers of any home income plan.

The occasion was a meeting with a man who clearly envies the Chinese leader's staying power &dash. Henry Kissinger, former US secretary of state. 
Mr Kissinger arrived in Peking just a week after Richard Nixon, his former boss and fellow architect of Sino-Soviet rapprochement in 1972. 
But unlike Mr Nixon, who had sharp words for his host, Mr Kissinger praised Mr Deng as one of the `few statesmen who have `always done more than <tag "537527">promised</>".

The right exists because the very same interest on which the power to promise and the duty to keep promises are based is also the ground for holding others to be subject to a duty not to interfere with one's promising. 
The duty requires one not to prevent a person from promising (e.g. by denying him the means of communicating an intention to undertake by that very communication an obligation, or by stopping others from receiving such communications). 
It also requires one not to force people to <tag "537527">promise</> nor to induce them improperly to promise or not to promise.

Willie had caught the bug, and his first top professional tournament duly arrived with a trip to Turnberry for the News of the World PGA Matchplay Championship, caddying for the legendary Scot Eric Brown.

But some people did worry, notably those who argued that Britain, having ruled Hong Kong as a benign dictatorship for more than 140 years, should institute a fully democratic government before 1997. 
They cited the Joint Declaration's <tag "537566">promise</> of `a legislature constituted by elections", and warned that without democracy, the autocratic machinery of colonial government might prove far less benign in China's hands.

A parent who gives medicine to the healthy child and not to the sick one, or who deceives one of his children and not the others, is treating them unequally. 
A person who keeps his promises to one person and breaks his promises to another is, likewise, treating them unequally. 
But in all these cases the wrong is the same as where a parent has only one child whom he deceives, or to whom he denies the medicine when he is sick, or when a person always breaks his <tag "538410">promises</> to all. 

800613
Clementi had a knack of thinking up good ideas, sometimes quite startling ones, and then not following them through or even getting bored with the effort (somewhat like my father and gadgets). 
When he did fulfil the <tag "537626">promise</> of an opening, though, he was stunning, even if I never found anyone to agree with me except the late Vladimir.

The owner of the new club was exultant.

MOST OF the #100m increase in benefits for the disabled due to be paid from April is being financed by a cut in government spending on sick pay, the Department of Social Security has disclosed. 
A memorandum from the department to the Social Security Advisory Committee says the cash is coming from a saving of between #70m and #80m a year in spending on statutory sick pay. 
Tony Newton, Secretary of State for Social Security, won support in the Commons in October by <tag "537527">promising</> the #100m increase in benefits.

The Lockerbie bombers used 300, just to be on the safe side, and This Week considered it quite feasible that the clandestine Czech squad had also been involved in training terrorists from abroad in attacks of this kind. 
If the people involved could be tracked down, <tag "537527">promised</> a man from the current Czech administration, they would be sent to jail.

As soon as you grow even a little weary of him, remember I am waiting for you here in Leicester. 
I cannot <tag "537527">promise</> you riches (although I have #139.37 in the Market Harborough Building Society) but I can offer intellectual chit-chat and my body, with is almost unsullied and is years younger then your husband's.  

800624
The person making the offer may be indifferent as to whether it will be accepted, or even hope that it will not (consider a polite offer to give a lift home to a person met at a party). 
An offer is more like a conditional <tag "537566">promise</>: I undertake to do it if you want me to.   

800625
Is it possible for an alcoholic to stop drinking? 
I had so many broken <tag "538410">promises</> from my husband, so perhaps I am prejudiced.

The trouble is that there is too much missing. 
The map of the Ghetto shows the maze of small streets and <tag "537563">promises</> a claustrophobic perspective, but this is never properly realised.   

800627
What the murders did reflect in an odd way was the convulsing extremism &dash. at both ends of a polarized spectrum &dash. that existed between right and left, counter-culture and establishment, in 1969, when Easy Rider was released. 
It was demonstrated by the fact that even after her death Sharon Tate was listed among the enemies of one extreme group, along with Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago and the Governor of California, Ronald Reagan who had just instructed his forces of law and order to `take whatever action necessary" to quell campus riots. 
The killing of Polanski's wife &dash. who was in her last month of pregnancy and carrying a `perfectly formed" baby son, also murdered &dash. along with three friends and a totally unconnected young man of eighteen who had been visiting a caretaker living in the grounds, naturally caused Polanski extreme mental torture, made worse by the knowledge that he had <tag "537527">promised</> to return to the house himself and had not made it in time.

It could either allow Fine Gael to form a government; go into coalition with Fine Gael; reach an agreement with the Progressive Democrats; or have another general election.

Mr Aylwin's rally mustered 400,000 people, or a tenth of Santiago's population, for an event of near-religious intensity. 
`This is the expression of a united, democratic Chile," Mr Aylwin told a sea of supporters above whom flew a rainbow of mingled banners from groups including the MIR left-wing guerrilla movement, as well as the conservative Christian Democrats. 
`Our challenge is to make of Chile a country that is free, just and good," said Mr Aylwin in a speech marked by conciliation and a <tag "537566">promise</> to heal the wounds of the past.

But I had (and still have) a violent temper.

Their fine performance holds great <tag "537573">promise</> for the future of music in Oxfordshire.

After a four-hour hearing Kelly denied that there had been any pre-Christmas charity. 
He explained that the Commission had taken into account the previous good record of West Ham and Wimbledon's improvement over the last 18 months; internal disciplinary measures already taken by West Ham; and a <tag "537566">promise</> during the hearing by Wimbledon's manager, Bobby Gould, that one player, Eric Young, would have action taken against him for retaliation.

Chris Barber: 
In 35 years on the road, the various editions of the Barber band have made a few crossovers of their own, into skiffle, blues and boogie as well as the fundementalist New Orleans style which still inspires the leader's earthy trombone. 
Here is the <tag "537625">promised</> reunion of Barber and clarinettist Monty Sunshine.   

800636
The man spends the novel debilitated by unrequited romantic love. 
What strains these good jokes, and dissipates the book's initial <tag "537626">promise</>, is that it's not enough just to think them up.

Construction of the new A90 plutonium-handling plant has been plagued by managerial and technical problems. 
The National Nuclear Corporation has recently been called in to sort out the A90 project and <tag "537527">promises</> to have it in production by 1992.

None of them is worked towards any cogent dramatic end, though. 
When Alphonse finally departs, with a song and dance, for the West Indies, the whole enterprise seems to be beating a retreat from the unresolved issues left littering the stage &dash. which is a pity, since there is as much <tag "537614">promising</> potential in this piece as there is talent among its performers.

The two prototypes on display weigh just 1870lb. 
Veyrat <tag "537527">promises</> that by the time the first of 20 #40,000 sports cars are built by June 1001, weight will still be under 2000lb and acceleration electrifying.

Friedrich Dickel, East Germany's outgoing Interior Minister, said cross-city bus services would link East and West; and that old, defunct underground railway stations would be reopened.

Sophie Faux, the image consultant behind many a successful woman, is branching out into the opposite sex. 
After 16 years, her Wardrobe Consultancy is addressing itself to the riskier business of advising men on how to look the part and impress their friends and clients.

A current artistic fashion is for television sketch performers to want to wear the same hair and voice for 30 minutes in a sort of one-off sitcom. 
Maureen Lipman is doing it, Smith and Jones have done it recently, and this new series of Victoria Wood contains six single-theme pieces. 
Regarded in some quarters as a departure, this is really more of a return as the comedienne was the Evening Standard Most <tag "537614">Promising</> Playwright of 1978 and had three full-length dramas televised.   

800644
Anyone wanting information about rebates should contact local Town Halls.

The Government <tag "537527">promised</> that no rate-payer would have to pay more than #3 per week extra under the Poll Tax.

Many ravers were unenthusiastic &dash. rap music is considered too turbulent a rhythm for the kind of happy-go-lucky event they seek, and because caution about the kind of crowd it draws. 
At least a dozen telephone numbers were given out at various stages, and the message that echoed throughout was that the rave was `definitely on". 
But details of the location, <tag "537527 or 537584">promised</> for after midnight, failed to materialise.  

800646
The Government faces a difficult time as it prepares to get its legislation on student loans through Parliament.

The first European university to be founded &dash. that is to say, to be set up by a competent authority, endowed with a charter of privileges, and with the expectation of permanent corporate existence &dash. was the University of Naples in 1224. 
Its founder was the Emperor Frederick II and, in his grandiose way, he made many <tag "538411">promises</> of advantages to both masters and students who came to his new university.

The Bank did, however, join forces with the Brazilian (military) government, which had consistently refused meaningful land reform, in order to deal with the sheer numbers of unemployed, landless peasants streaming into the cities. 
A stopgap measure was conceived to entice them to settle instead in Amazonia, where they were <tag "537527">promised</> a better future and title to land.

Its candidate back in December was a rich avocado farmer and old-guard party machine-man, Mr Joaquin Barragan.

Certainly his successor, Yuri Prokofiev, at 50 representing a new political generation, is more sympathetic to the Gorbachev reforms and better respected by Muscovites.

ROME (Agencies) &dash. The Polish Prime Minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, said yesterday that his country desperately needed food aid by mid-November to survive the winter. 
Italy has <tag "537527">promised</> dollars 400m ( #255m) in export credits.   

800653
It is not inappropriate that this Franco-German town should be the venue for a summit dominated by a Franco-German row that appears and disappears like the Cheshire cat in Alice in Wonderland. 
For those with more specific Euro-memories, the gem of deja-vu is the recollection that in 1979, Mrs Thatcher, attending her first European summit in Strasbourg, <tag "537527">promised</> that Britain would join European Monetary System `when the time was right". 

800654
Mr Rifkind claims that the Scottish arm of NCC is itself in favour of autonomy, but this is a minority view expressed by a few of the Government's own appointees to the Scottish Advisory Committee for NCC. 
It is interesting to note that despite being <tag "537527">promised</> job security the majority of NCC staff in Scotland are against the split.

All she had to make herself look more appealing was a slick of lipstick in a rather unassertive pink. 
He took her to a pompous oyster bar, around the corner as he had <tag "537527">promised</>.

So I went back and read what I had written about Eastern Europe over the past quarter-century. 
There were enough mistakes, mostly about people, to make me shudder, and I recognised a fatal tendency to be optimistic about new figures in the Communist hierarchies who took power with a fanfare of exciting <tag "537566">promises</>.

Mr Chirac's counter-Bicentenary has not been an overwhelming success. 
He has quietly shelved many <tag "537566">promises</>, such as a replica Bastille, and mismanaged the Eiffel Tower centenary fete which turned out to be a ten million pound extravaganza that only a privileged few could see.   

800661
The rest of British film production, however, was impoverished. 
Many directors launched their careers at the beginning of the decade with shoestring productions, made a <tag "537614">promising</> film or two, then faded from the scene.

He has already <tag "537527">promised</> them to the secretary, Michael Bonallack.

It is impossible to put in capsule form all the myriad tasks necessary to build such a base, but certainly the following actions must be taken: 
Develop long-term aggregate estimates (e.g., over three to five years) of capacity requirements, along with the necessary staffing and funding   Develop detailed short-term budgets (e.g., over a two-year horizon) for MIS activities within the general guidelines of the longer-term plan  Develop means for educating users in MIS concepts  Manage procedures for attracting, training, and providing attractive career paths for the technical staff  Plan and manage the implementation and operation of a communications network  Plan and manage the implementation and operation of data sharing mechanisms (e.g., data dictionary, database management system, data administration)  Plan and manage the installation of office information systems, with special emphasis on text processing, interpersonal communications, and document transmission  Plan and manage the implementation of centrally developed application programs  Plan and manage user support services  Provide a high-productivity software development environment (e.g., 4GLs, extensive program library, interactive debugging facilities with subsecond response)  Develop procedures for project planning and control Develop procedures for budgeting and charging for information services, including both user- and centrally-funded activities  Develop vendor selection policies (e.g., a single- versus multiple-vendor environment)  Develop software acquisition policies (e.g., make versus buy) Develop mechanisms for identifying and introducing <tag "537614">promising</> new technology  The list could go on &dash. the

Two kinds of conditional promises are of interest here: First a promise made conditional on an action by the promisee (e.g., `I will give you ten pounds if you give me the book"). 
Second (which is in fact a special case of the above), a promise made conditional on a promise to be given by the promisee (e.g., `I will give you ten pounds if you promise to give me the book"). 
Whenever such a <tag "538411">promise</> is made and the condition is fulfilled, there is an agreement between the promisor and the promisee.

The Bulgarian leader, Petar Mladenov, who last month replaced the disgraced veteran, Todor Zhivkov, has been anxious to prove his readiness for reform amid a wave of street demonstrations calling for widespread change. 
The Communist Party has said it will renounce its leading role in government and has <tag "537527">promised</> free elections, but many of Bulgaria's burgeoning opposition groups say these pledges do not go far enough.

Two United Nations reports this year on Eastern Europe concluded that only Hungary and Poland have decisively broken with the Communist tradition of central planning.

State Department officials said yesterday that 300 items on the `munitions list" were affected, including weather radar, tugboats and automated bank teller machines; the latter contain electronic coding systems with a possible military value. 
Meanwhile the Chinese students now in the US, to whom President Bush offered asylum, are now claiming that the limited visa extensions actually on offer could make a return to China even more dangerous. 
Fewer than twenty of the 40,000 and more Chinese students in the US have taken up his <tag "537566">promise</> of a visa extension, which was intended to spare them from being forced to return home at the end of their studies.

The more people get used to prodding, weighing and evaluating new planning proposals, the less likely it is that the Hammersmith effect will spread further. 
HAMMERSMITH in west London, home of some all too visible faceless architecture, has been chosen as the site of what <tag "537563">promises</> to be one of Britain's most remarkable buildings, an enormous office block designed on natural lines by the Royal Gold Medallist Ralph Erskine, Jonathan Glancey writes.

The violent street demonstration witnessed by Abercrombie in Beirut had been in protest at these electoral violations. 
Chamoun then attempted to capitalise upon his victory by contem- plating a change in the constitution that would allow him a second term as president. 
The National Covenant had already been weakened by Chamoun's decision to accept the Eisenhower Doctrine, under which the United States <tag "537527">promised</> to use its forces to help any nation which requested assistance against aggressors controlled by `international communism".

Listening to the first day's proceedings, I found myself not transported into the future so much as revisiting the past. 
Here was the Labour Party reverting to its old self, a better self, yes, than the monster it became under the demonic spell of Tony Benn; here was a party responsive once more to its own people, the people it so shamefully betrayed at two successive general elections since 1979, but a party &dash. as somebody once said of the SDP &dash. `<tag "537527">promising</> a better yesterday".

Keifetz stood for Flag, Family and Country. 
He was ardently committed to the Flag to which he referred affectionately as `Old Tootsie" and led the 67-person staff at Keifetz Hall, Greenwich, each morning in singing the national anthem, controlled by pitch pipe, followed by a massed Pledge of Allegiance in Latin, the original form of the oath as it had been taken daily by the Roman legionaries under Julius Caesar in 50 BC with: `I pledge allegiance to the balance of trade and to the Export-Import Bank for which it stands.

It is understood that the Bank of England backed higher rates to protect the pound but was less convinced that they needed to be raised to cool down the economy any further. 
Treasury officials emphasised that Nigel Lawson, the Chancellor, has never <tag "537527">promised</> a `soft landing" in which inflation abates but growth continues moderately.   

800692
Promises, on the other hand, cannot, except in very special circumstances, ever be made concerning the actions of another person. 
Further, while both promises and consent generate special rights and obligations, the emphases in the two cases are different. 
The primary purpose of a <tag "537566">promise</> is to undertake an obligation; the special rights which arise for the promisee are in a sense secondary.   

800693
I liked Diana Soviero's Nedda, though the easy and attractive top of her voice has little to do with the middle and lower register. 
There was <tag "537614">promising</> support from Anthony Michaels-Moore's Silvio, teeth and eyes flashing, tone softly romantic.   

800694
However, despite all the emergencies, in the first instance, the Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia (of 18 November 1917) boldly committed the new Bolshevik Government to support the national self-determination of Russia's peoples `even to the point of separation and the formation of an independent State". 
And when the regime finally came to reverse its former position and accept the principle of federation embodied in the new Russian Soviet Federation of Socialist Republics (RSFSR), the same <tag "537566">promise</> was embodied in the new constitution.   

800695
Parishioners are asked to make maximum use of the Begbroke-Yarnton-Kidlington minibus, as there are already rumblings about removing the subsidy at the end of the trial year. 
The parish council is urging the county highways department to honour its <tag "537566">promise</> of a high priority for a weight restriction on the Cassington Road railway bridge.

British and Hong Kong officials have recently said agreement with Vietnam on mandatory repatriation is near, but that no date has yet been set for the first batch of returnees. 
Hong Kong has introduced a progressively more spartan regime for arriving refugees over the past seven years, claiming that Western countries have abandoned their <tag "537566">promises</> to provide adequate resettlement places.

`But we can offer people at least some relief, and the voters have learned to believe us.

With the opposition as it is, if he came back the way he used to be he could pick them up and carry them." 
Henderson also confirmed that his immensely <tag "537614">promising</> novice chaser The Proclamation will not run at Cheltenham on Monday but will contest instead a #20,000 race at Ascot on 12 January.

But Labour, too, was disappointing in its reluctance to sketch out what an alternative science policy might look like.

The remaining candidate, Teimuraz Avaliani, the party leader in the coal-mining town of Kiselevsk, was one of the champions of the strikes in the Kuzbass which broke out a year ago today. 
Thousands of miners started a new strike today as midnight spread across the Soviet time zones, in protest at the government's failure to implement the <tag "537566">promises</> which ended last year's stoppages.  

800702
Surely common sense will prevail again soon and allow the players in this extraordinary drama to deliver their lines without impediment from rowdy reviewers. 
But if this new alliance brings extra pressure for Dunwoody, who took over on `the grey horse", as he calls him, when Simon Sherwood retired last season, signs of anguish were hard to detect at his home this week as he weighed up the big dates and high hopes of his exceptionally <tag "537614">promising</> winter.   

800703
There are many questions Mr Meacher still has to answer. 
In the first place, Mr Meacher has <tag "537527">promised</> that a Labour government would allow `sympathy strikes" &dash. that is, strikes against employers who have no quarrel with their own employees &dash. wherever the strikers `have a genuine interest in the outcome of the dispute".

Next Tuesday's trade figures would confirm that Britain's balance of payments deficit was not just the worst in Europe, but the worst ever. 
`For a year the Chancellor has <tag "537527">promised</> that inflation is a temporary blip on the road to zero inflation.   

800705
It was officially confirmed that Margot Honecker, Minister of Education for the past 26 years and the estranged wife of the deposed leader, Erich Honecker, has resigned. 
Harry Tisch, the national trade union leader, went as <tag "537527">promised</>, to be replaced by Annelis Kimmel.

Her lover had a romanesque skirted tunic and a short cloak. 
Although John was generally a quick worker, Anne Heaton remembers him as taking a long time over this work and seeming nervous about it. 
The result was not without <tag "537626">promise</>, but distant memory suggests that the piece was as artificial as the clothes, a minor and mildly amusing exercise in an old-fashioned style.   

800708
At one point he compares her to an antelope, beautiful because terrified. 
In her turn she <tag "537527">promises</> to follow him to the ends of the earth with her dresses, her black eyes, her violin and her folly.

`Yes," he said briefly.

`The shit," Jo muttered, slamming down the receiver. 
Victoria woke up an hour later, pale and puffy-eyed. 
Jo brought her tea in bed, and relayed Richard's <tag "537566">promise</> in an encouraging tone.

With water privatization looming large, and with prosecutions against farmers for pollution continuing at an arguably pitiful level, concern naturally focusses on the future accountability of water companies to keep water courses clean. 
But the Minister <tag "537527">promised</> tough new legal penalties for all polluters.

The gold at Mount Kare (pronounced car-ray) was discovered last year, not far from an even bigger deposit at Porgera, 9,000 feet up in the central highlands. 
There are two ways to reach either place: by helicopter or treacherous mountain tracks, where bandits lie in wait. 
The riches of Mount Kare and Porgera, together with extraordinary discoveries elsewhere of copper, oil, gold and silver, <tag "537563">promise</> to transform this Third World country.

First, because identification with one's community is morally worthwhile, and acceptance of the authority of the state an appropriate way (though not the only way) to express it, one may jump to the conclusion that one has an obligation to accept the authority of the state, or even that it has authority independently of such acceptance. 
Reflection on the analogous case of promises dispels this impression. 
There are times when making a certain <tag "538411">promise</> (say to look after a friend's child if the friend dies before the child comes of age) are morally worthwhile but where one does not have an obligation to make them (remember that in this example too one may find other adequate ways to help one's friend).

A week later, after yet another huge demonstration in Sofia's cathedral square, he retreated even on that. 
At an emergency session of the Central Committee on 11 December, he <tag "537527">promised</> to hold free, multi-party elections by next May, and to abolish the party's leading role.

The gravadlax came in thick, rustic slices while the satisfyingly meaty chunks of soused herring emerged in the candlelight from a creamy coleslaw sauce with the occasional unseen lemon wedge adding surprise and bite. 
We passed up brill, scallops, skate and stuffed mushrooms, the vegetarian dish of the week, in favour of goose breast with red cabbage and Biff Strindberg. 
The biff <tag "537584">promised</> diced beef fillet in a sauce of sauteed onions and mustard and delivered not so much dice as cubes of beef which were nevertheless tender enough for someone undergoing a crowns renewal course. 

800717
Dr Ian Field, the association's secretary, said it was prepared to accept there had been a misunderstanding. 
But Mr Clarke's statements since the meeting `give the impression that he reneged on his <tag "537566">promise</> to us.

As the Forum celebrated its victory in a city centre theatre, the old squares and cobbled streets of the capital echoed to the sounds of symphony orchestras, rock bands and buskers ushering in a new era of elected democracy. 
`The Forum vote was a vote for the energy to introduce change," said Ivan Gabal, the Forum's elections co-ordinator. 
`We have got a strong mandate to continue with what we <tag "537527">promised</>."

Those are agent-relative reasons. 
A person who made a <tag "538411">promise</> has an agent-relative reason to keep it, even though it may derive from an agent-neutral reason to keep one's promises.   

800724
That this performance was completely open to all-comers signalled unequivocally that the Gorbachevian renaissance was a reality. 
His performance was intended as a celebration of that renaissance, and also of the prospects for world peace: for in Moscow Comrade Gorbachev and President Reagan were holding a summit meeting which <tag "537563">promised</> to bear fruit in disarmament.

Even an experienced bon-viveur like yourself must yearn for just one experience of sheer unadulterated delight that's eluded you so far.

A mother  who has put her daughter on the stage and made her into a  teenage star is obviously aware that she is moulding  something special. 
She knows there is nothing that is more  attractive that the <tag "537573">promise</> of sexuality waiting to bloom,  and so if this is what is responsible for fame, Kylie wants  to keep her pre-puberty looks."   

800727
So far we have discussed the right to promise. 
The right which the promise confers on the promisee does not derive from the right to promise which is a right of the promisor. 
Many writers on <tag "537566">promises</> insist that the promised act must be or at least must be thought to be in the interest of the promisee.

The Alliance has now surprised itself by completing this work two months ahead of the target date. 
Nato envisages that it will have to scrap about 1,000 aircraft, while the Warsaw Pact would be required to scrap 9,000. 
A new political party for West Germany's older generation, the Greys, was born yesterday, <tag "537527">promising</> to fight for pensioners" rights and greater social acceptance of the increasing numbers of over-sixties, Anna Tomforde writes from Bonn.

The internationalisation of the former Eastern bloc economies, including the Soviet Union, will transform those societies. 
There will be an end to the fiction of universal employment and people will discover that there is a downside to the <tag "537566">promise</> of prosperity, that pain will have to be endured to fulfill the hope of pleasure.

BRITAIN'S fishermen were warned last night that they cannot expect any increase in catch quotas until measures to improve the conservation of stocks begin to work. 
John Gummer, Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, <tag "537527">promised</> in the Commons to fight for the best deal possible for Britain's fishing industry in next week's EC negotiations to agree catch quotas for 1990.

Basically what I, I think the best thing that's happened to Oxford United this season, well there are two; the signing of Andy Melville at the back and Jim Madgelton, a very young man, but he's got the balance, he can add the poise, and I feel he's going to help Oxford. 
And mark my words, Oxford United will be at the top half of the, of the division by Christmas, I <tag "537655">promise</> you, once they get it sorted out, there's not one side in the second division who are better than Oxford.

First a look at some of today's main stories in some more detail. 
It's being reported by an American television network, that Iraq is saying that all foreign hostages in Saddam Hussein's human shield, can leave Kuwait and Baghdad if President Bush promises not to launch an attack. 
The Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, told the American television network CNN, that the Westerners would be free to leave once the White House made that <tag "538411">promise</>. 

800734
But labelling by numbers is certainly an easy way of selling films. 
Time was when the studio logo did the job, <tag "537563">promising</> a distinctive house style, stars and creative personnel, but, given the vagaries of deal-making in modern Hollywood, these packages cannot be counted on any more.   

800735
Rather, it would intervene where needed and invest in research and development and training, he said. 
Mr Gould <tag "537527">promised</> the party would restore `the great utilities" to public ownership and insist on higher standards of regulation than those which had prevailed under the Conservatives.

Spain, who until recently had been contending that they had more right than England to be seeded, seemed satisfied. 
Perhaps the outcome of tomorrow's draw will explain their change of heart; they are rumoured to have been <tag "537527">promised</> a base near Genoa.   

800738
The Russians and East Germans have built large accommodation blocks for their soldiers but done little else. 
America, the architect of a devastating war, reneged on <tag "537566">promises</> of reparations and then forced through crippling international embargoes on machinery, foodstuffs and medical equipment.

It was true that each payment was made after the successful importation of cannabis to which the payment related. 
But in each case payment was made in performance of the promise of reward by which the defendant's assistance was procured. 
Therefore the subsequent payment could not be isolated from the antecedent <tag "537566">promise</> in pursuance of which it was made.

We agree that if we are writing in the first person, we will use the word `I" and not nauseating expressions such as `your humble author", `my very good self", `the present writer", `a person not a million miles from myself", `the undersigned", etc.

The US Southern Command called the accusations ridiculous, declaring: `We had nothing to do with the coup." 
The White House admitted it had known of the plot for days and had not discouraged the rebels. 
The US military source said while there were no <tag "537566">promises</> of specific US military help, it was made clear the rebels would be welcome to send the general to stand trial in the US.   

800746
It was impossible for the FA, having accused Arsenal and Norwich of bringing the game into disrepute for one mass scuffle, to avoid levelling the same charge at Wednesday's teams, who were involved in three incidents in similar vein, provoking fighting and coin throwing by rival supporters. 
Bobby Gould, Wimbledon's manager, said he thought the referee had handled a difficult match very well. 
He was less happy with the conduct of some of his players, and <tag "537527">promised</> an internal inquiry.

After a long-winded description of the historical background to the war, and survey of the situation in the east &dash. hinting that the war would continue to drag on over the coming winter &dash. Hitler, in the part of the speech which attracted most attention, demanded full powers to act immediately and ruthlessly `independent of person and status" where anyone was found not to be fulfilling his duties to the `people's community" and failing in the war effort and <tag "537527">promised</> an `inexorable challenge to every form of corruption and omission of duty".

Sayed is one of five youngsters pushing hard to become international class players. 
Another with the undoubted talent to do so is Michael O'Driscoll, the European junior silver medallist who plans next season to postpone his university education by two years to try to make the grade.

The satellite pictures shows a lot of cloud just to the east of us, but you'll see that it is moving away.

I cannot speak for the nurses but I am sure they are no different. 
In the current climate it is not easy to sustain morale but we are proud of the fact that we have treated many more patients and performed many more operations this year than last, even with our closed beds.

This parable of absurdity makes a valid point about the millions of pounds run  up as a result of a European agricultural policy which takes little account of the  differing climates of its member States, and has thus encouraged the production  of massive grain surpluses on our wet, westerly Atlantic island. 
Tragically,  farmers such as Mr Powell, who have been lured by government policy into  spending every penny they have upon agricultural intensification, will now have  difficulty in finding the capital to de-escalate and diversify their farming practices. 
In 1985 and 1986, with major land-drainage grants cut and the price of wheat  <tag "537563">promising</> to fall, some farmers were still carrying out land drainage to promote  cereal production, which, with the enforcement of dairy quotas, continued, at  least for the time being, to offer a good return.

A young Abyssinian, returning to camp with a victim's testicle hanging from his belt, he compared to `a deserving young Etonian who has just got his colours for cricket." 
Legend is an overworked term in jazz: it can describe a figure like Eubie Blake, who died at 100 after a lifetime's achievement, or those who died young, their <tag "537626">promise</> unfulfilled, like everyone from Jimmy Blanton to Charlie Parker.

Locarno in fact ruled out any staff talks between Great Britain and France (or, of course, between Great Britain and Germany) so long as it existed, and no British strategist had to weigh the problems of Anglo-French co-operation until after Locarno collapsed. 
The guarantee was very much `a harmless drug to soothe nerves" in the MacDonald manner. 
Even this paper <tag "538411">promise</> was made largely in order to emphasize that it was the limit of British commitment.

Yesterday it was the turn of the Christian Maronite patriarch, Nasrallah Sfeir, to bring the poisoned chalice of defeat to General Aoun. 
He flew to Beirut from Rome after consulting there with Lebanese Christian MPs, and announced on arrival that he supported the agreement signed in the Saudi town of Taif. 
The patriarch, escorted to the airport terminal by Lebanese troops and the same Syrian soldiers General Aoun once <tag "537527">promised</> to throw out of Lebanon, then drove to east Beirut where he was expected to hold talks with the general.

I am here to offer you the partnership of the United States of America," he declared to the longest applause of his speech. 
But as in Poland, the grandeur of Mr Bush's liberationist rhetoric was not matched by the power of his purse.

If agreement is reached, the Soviets will destroy 14 times as many weapons as would the West. 
The East Germans whom I saw yesterday queueing in their thousands at West Berlin banks for their spending money, lining up for Barenboim's free concert and gazing into shop-windows have not only changed their government, won the <tag "537566">promise</> of free elections, and gained the right of free movement.

He, busy with Euclid and Latin, did not notice the passage through parliament of Balfour's Education Act of 1902 &dash. which had a profound effect on the shape of secondary education throughout Britain, and therefore in Oxfordshire.

Mr Rifkind had been facing the embarrassing prospect of a widespread revolt among his backbenchers over the bill, which abolishes Scottish solicitors" long-held monopoly over conveyancing. 
But yesterday he made what were described as `significant concessions" to try to ensure a passage for the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill. 
He is thought to have <tag "537527">promised</> to look at the situation of solicitors in rural areas which was concerning some MPs.

Amid the relentless pulse and sweeping crescendos of the music, Lowe and Tennant have remained always apart, more like narrators than characters caught up in the drama of it all. 
While the pair <tag "537563">promise</> an exhilarating hour and a half with costume changes rising into double figures and a deluge of dancing framed against Jarman's cinematic responses to the songs, it is their own reaction to the spectacle and the audience that may provide the most intriguing aspect of the shows.   

800778
Every relationship was a torment of anticipating that final inevitable moment when understanding would gleam in the Other's eyes, lighting up the vast vacancy yawning within poor Len. 
His hope was to push that moment off as long as possible, to maintain a suffering silence which the face promised was deep and awful. 
This <tag "537527-x">promise</> is what attracted me to Len, and the attraction ended the moment I penetrated the sad little secret.

They were followers of Prince Johnson, leader of a rival faction of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) led by Charles Taylor. 
Earlier Mr Taylor had announced the formation of a new government with himself at its head, and <tag "537527">promised</> to capture Mr Doe and put him on trial.

I would claim, though I will not stop to illustrate the point at length, that sometimes one's choice does make it right for one to pursue a goal which but for one's commitment to it would have been a wrong goal to pursue. 
The analogy with <tag "537527-n">promising</> can serve here as well. 

800784
But I don't want them getting lost, mind. 
You've to <tag "537527">promise</> to look after them and let me have them back when I come up next."

One of the most expensive was the packaging of Burt Reynolds, Gene Hackman and Liza Minnelli in Lucky Lady, for which the studio had to wait a year until they were all available; it was not a success. 
However, for the actors like Nicholson themselves, it meant fatter pay cheques on offer and the <tag "537566">promise</> of joint billings with the biggest of names.

`I gave her all the money I had," Mara says.

Tribune is holding a one-day conference at the Kingsway College, London, today on Labour in office, discussing lessons to be learnt from Labour's last term in government in the Seventies. 
Mr Prescott last night attacked the Government for a `missed opportunity" in failing to introduce its <tag "537625">promised</> legislation on the North Report on road traffic law reform.   

800788
LEO (July 24-Aug 23): Why not take a leaf out of a buddy's book and adopt a more speculative approach to your future financial strategies? 
You'll be encouraged and enthused by a pal's plans for making money and there'll rarely be a better time for chancing your luck and investing in a scheme that <tag "537563">promises</> rich pickings.   

800789
This strikes me as wholly sensible; but it does imply a rather different view of collective bargaining than that which union leaders used to advocate when they railed against income policies. 
They used different language but relied on essentially the same argument as monetarists: that pay deals should depend on `free collective bargaining" or `market forces" rather than on some wider concept of national interest or social justice. 
This view was backed by a bold theory that offered a firm <tag "537566">promise</>.

He limped out of Sunday's first Test with a calf strain but the injury has responded well to treatment and Reilly is looking for `at least 40 good minutes" from him on Sunday. 
The chief architects of Wellington's win on Wednesday, the loose forward Mike Kuiti and scrum-half Geoffrey Tangira, play in a Maori side that <tag "537563">promises</> a tough game, which, a week before the second Test, is what Britain need and want.   

800791
The party general secretary, Larry Whitty, said the changes were intended to make policy `a more serious and deliberative" process. 
Labour's current policies were good but that was more by luck than judgment. 
Mr Field last night <tag "537527">promised</> to stand by the result of a second selection contest rather than resign and force a byelection.

Many of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies are expected to bid for the biotechnology organisation, which was set up in 1980 by the National Enterprise Board. 
Although some critics believe Celltech has failed to live up to its early <tag "537626">promise</>, it has 450 staff, many of whom are bright scientists.

Klein's poet has no `homeward" to look to, except the home that exists in his own consciousness and in his attempts to find `a new function for the declasse&acute. craft". 
Where Milton <tag "537527">promises</> his Lycidas a joyous immortality with all kinds of saintly company, Klein's poet can barely achieve an evanescent lonely glow at the bottom of the sea.

If you would rather watch somebody else make a fool of themselves, go along at 7.30 pm and watch the solo artist perform his silent comedy about civilisation, Land of Make Believe. 
THE acting chairman of the Bury Knowle Art Group, Alex Eaglestone, will have one pleasant and one sad duty to perform at the private view of the society's Spring Exhibition at the Central Library, Westgate, tonight. 
The pleasant duty is to hand over a prize of #100 in materials to Oxford Polytechnic foundation art student Harriet Lee, the first of what he hopes will become regular awards to <tag "537614">promising</> young artists.

Ian Botham can't have been expecting to have such a free winter, but he's certainly filling it innovatively with a national tour of his show, An Evening With Ian Botham. 
Clips of his `Greatest Hits", various filmed interviews and the odd surprise guest are <tag "537527">promised</>, followed by `Both" taking questions from the floor.

A comeback simply cannot be ruled out. 
If a new government is formed and it fails to deliver on its <tag "537566">promises</>, and if, as many Indian observers believe, factional feuds in a Janata Dal-led administration gradually force its collapse, it is by no means out of the question that India will turn to a Gandhi again.

It is not an immediately obvious choice for a dirty weekend, but the only other guests are those taking advantage of `celebrate romance" special deals to keep the place ticking over while the weekday corporate businessmen are away.

The army of Palestine took Jerusalem in December 1917. 
The oil of the Middle East was falling into British hands, while the conquest of Palestine enabled the British government to win the favour of Jews in the United States &dash. and perhaps in central Europe also &dash. by <tag "537527">promising</> that Palestine should become a national home for the Jews.

It's that sunny this afternoon we'll look suspicious if we don't."

But he said: `Having a somewhat suspicious nature I fear that the new commercially oriented electricity PLCs will in future have to answer to their shareholders, and profitability inevitably will take precedence over service. 
So the <tag "537566">promise</> might easily be forgotten."   

800801
This was not so. 
The British government did not underwrite the French claim to Alsace and Lorraine until October 1917, and the secret treaties (except for the treaty of London, which <tag "537527">promised</> unconditionally what Italy `will receive" ) were attempts to avoid conflict between the allies after victory, not definitions of the objects for which the war was being fought.   

800802
It was of films like these that the exhibitor Sidney Bernstein may have been speaking when he said: 
`The public has always wanted good British films, not the million-pound epics, which so often bore them, but the good, honest, unpretentious stories in which we have shown such <tag "537626">promise</> &dash. the records of everyday life.

Africa is now littered with the discarded blueprints of the last quarter of a century. 
These have ranged from the emotional, continent-wide vision of Kwame Nkrumah (`Africa must unite"), to Julius Nyerere's target of `socialism in one country", to the hard boiled `Africa needs Europe" school of Houphouet Boigny and Kenyatta. 
Each of these visions has left its own particular legacy, some transparently more successful than others, but all falling short of their original <tag "537626">promise</>.

John White, Moseley's chairman, said: `We consider that Adrian's actions were entirely inappropriate and have suspended him for three matches. 
Coventry have been informed and they will receive a letter of confirmation, but Adrian has expressed his regret and has offered an unreserved apology." 
Paul Hull, the <tag "537614">promising</> youngster who plays his club rugby at wing or centre but is preferred at stand-off by English selectors, has been given his head by Bristol for tomorrow's visit to Rugby.

The Americans intended to stop at this point; the British hoped for further distractions. 
At the same time, the Americans would move forward in the Pacific, and the British <tag "537527">promised</> to undertake an offensive in Burma also &dash. a promise which they were unable to keep.   

800808
There are no easy answers to African development, and an appropriate degree of humility on the part of donors is a necessary condition for developing a serious dialogue with recipient governments. 
The confidence displayed by the World Bank men and other donors in the early 1970s has clearly not fulfilled its <tag "537626">promise</>.   

800809
France received some temporary securities: demilitarization of the Rhineland; its occupation by Allied forces for fifteen years ; and control of the Saar, with its coal mines, for fifteen years, after which its future was to be determined by a plebiscite. 
Clemenceau was also lured into concession by the <tag "537566">promise</> of an Anglo-American guarantee against any new German aggression.

China maintains the same professed intentions. 
The Basic Law will still be enacted, <tag "537527">promising</> a panoply of rights and freedoms for 50 years beyond 1997.

The decision, which is due to be announced in the House of Commons, is expected to be followed soon by a similar move by the US, which withdrew from Unesco a year before the UK. 
Both the British and US governments &dash. which withdrew from the international organisation because they felt it was too politicised, over-staffed and financially mismanaged &dash. feel that a reform programme <tag "537527">promised</> by Mr Federico Mayor, Unesco's director-general, has taken too long to implement.

the promise would be legally binding. 
It was accepted that by promising to pay the extra #10,300 the defendants secured benefits. 
There was no suggestion that the <tag "538412">promise</> was given as a result of fraud or duress. 

800813
But why is it a right? 
The interest on which it is based validates the promising principle, namely: If a person communicates an intention to undertake by that very act of communication a certain obligation then he has that obligation. 
The <tag "537527-a">promising</> principle establishes that if we promise we are obligated to act as we promised.

But trial by media &dash. partial, simplistic and usually sensational &dash. is no substitute for trials by judges, decided by fundamental principles of law. 
While Strasbourg is necessary as a court of last resort, it remains a serious reproach to British law that it lacks the internal dynamics to provide speedy and effective redress for many breaches of fundamental freedoms. 
The generalised <tag "537566">promises</> of a bill of rights are no substitute for statutes which limit, precisely and clearly, the powers of officialdom, but they do provide a bedrock upon which such statutes may be built.   

800816
IT IS about as impenetrable as any dispute in the European Community can get, but it threatens either to seriously weaken the edifice of `Project 1992" or at least to bury businessmen under a landslide of new paperwork. 
At issue is one small, but key part of the European Commission's plan for an alignment of Value Added Tax (VAT) and Excise rates in the 12 member states, which it considers essential if frontier checks on traders are to be abolished after 1992. 
The area of dispute, which <tag "537563">promises</> to occupy all of a meeting of EC finance ministers in Luxembourg today, is over the Commission's proposal that the current system of exporting goods free of VAT be abandoned and that after 1992 the tax should be levied in the country of origin before export.   

800817
Deaf by nature and blinded by his entourage, Deng issued crazy orders which, being passed through an already rotten system, could not fail to be distorted in their transmission. 
Soldiers began to fire on the crowd, discharging a hatred stirred up by propaganda directed against the empty-handed people, who themselves had not realised they had been for years subject to the whims of a few executioners. 
Retaining a vestige of faith in their <tag "537566">promises</>, they continued to gather in support of democracy.

Martha's Vineyard is the best of a poor bunch, but even they have a vocalist who sounds like Chrissie Hynde.

Garsington Parish Council raised no objections to the scheme.

It may be a long while, however, before we get a fresh sci-fi myth of equal longevity. 
Certainly, as the final credits of Millennium (PG) roll and a sepulchral voice intones, `This is not the beginning of the end; it is the end of the beginning," the remark sounds more like a threat than a <tag "537566">promise</>.

In his first speech as Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi dismissed the episode as a natural occurrence. 
`When a big tree falls, the earth beneath it shakes," he said, though earlier this year he <tag "537527">promised</> that `everybody will be brought to book through the legal system".

His birdie putt on the 18th yesterday, to take him to one over and ensure safety, hung on the lip, half of it over the hole, and he was fortunate that the rest of the field did not exact the ultimate penalty.

It's terrific Jane actually, the buzz is really out there, it's just what we hoped would happen, and really very much thanks to Fox in fact, {vocal sound="um"} it seems to be happening.

This was a deception. 
Kitchener went for a walk with Joffre and <tag "537527">promised</> not to oppose an offensive in the autumn if Hamilton's further attack at Gallipoli were allowed to take place first.

Westminster suggestions that Nigel Lawson, who is abroad, had not taken part were discounted by Nigel Forman (Carshalton and Wallington), said that he had cast a proxy vote for the former Chancellor of the Exchequer. 
AN URGENT inquiry into allegations that some credit reference agencies are supplying `dangerous and misleading" information to lenders was <tag "537527">promised</> by a government minister in the Commons yesterday.

Its first number brought together Dylan Thomas, Stephen Spender and Lawrence Durrell. 
Subsequent erratic editions &dash. notably the large hardback, known colloquially as `Chums" because Tambi tried to include everyone to whom he had made hitherto unfulfilled <tag "538411">promises</> of publication &dash. display the ragbag quality which led Geoffrey Grigson to nickname him `Tuttifrutti".  

800832
The relaxation is fairly useful for BAT because, as well as buying its own shares, it also means BAT can talk to investors for longer. 
Given that the company still has to deliver the goods <tag "537527">promised</> in its restructuring programme and continues to face the prospect of another bid from Sir James, this could prove beneficial.

The church of St Nicholas, Whitehaven, had burnt to the ground.

FOR Michael Chang it was the end and the beginning. 
The 17-year-old American, who has given men's tennis such a lift and the watching public such enjoyment this summer, took his leave of Wimbledon yesterday with an anti-climactic performance but with the <tag "537566">promise</> of a career's worth of achievement to come.

He says he has no objection to ABC's embryo products `if they involve an animal in a normal pregnancy and you get a better animal at the end of it.

On Monday evening the President of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, replied in the language of Jean Monnet. 
To be sure, he specifically repudiated Monnet's notion of the `United States of Europe", <tag "537527 or 537584">promising</> `there is no plot against the nation state, no one is being asked to renounce a legitimate patriotism".   

800837
To take some of the sting out of what was unmistakably a defeat for traditional nationalism, provisions were included promising equality of esteem and a collective recognition of the legitimacy of nationalism. 
Reforms were promised to remove persisting inequities. 
It was clear that the Unionists would raise hell but, on the other hand, the accord held the <tag "537573">promise</> of greatly improved Anglo-Irish relations, and the beginnings of a new arrangement which could help to isolate Sinn Fein and the IRA.   

800838
Yesterday's newspapers were consumed not with Mr Bush's campaign stop for Mr Giuliani, but with the position of David Dinkins, the Democratic candidate, on security for the state of Israel, and Woody Allen's defence of the comedian Jackie Mason. 
Mr Allen said Mr Mason was joking when he called Mr Dinkins `a fancy schvartze with a moustache" and that Jews would only vote for him out of guilt. 
Yesterday's newspaper columns on the election were devoted to Mr Dinkins' <tag "537527">promises</> to defend Jewish interests in the same way that Mayor Ed Koch did for the past 12 years.   

800839
Kent slumped to 29 for four and eventually followed on after being bowled out for 164 despite Ellcock suffering back spasms and not bowling during the afternoon. 
John Emburey took three for 23 in 23.4 overs, but there was an innings of great <tag "537626">promise</> from Mark Dobson, playing in only his second championship game, who scored a stubborn 28.

The Congress, at this time under the control of the Social Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, rejected the demand, and Kerensky, on behalf of the provisional Government, affirmed the right of the central government to veto any secessionist proposals.

Mary Joe Fernandez is another seed under threat &dash. from Gabriela Sabatini's conqueror Ros Fairbank &dash. but after an easy win over Anne Hobbs, Britain's last hope, Chris Evert should move on to the quarters (and equal Billie Jean King's record of 95 Wimbledon wins) at Patty Fendick's expense. 
With much better weather now <tag "537584">promised</>, a colourful second week looms.

So by flying regular infra-red aerial  photographic missions over the volcano, it may be possible to predict the  sites of new activity precisely. 
The method has yet to be fully tried and tested, though, and, although it  looks <tag "537614">promising</>, it may not be particularly useful because the surface  temperature changes may not be detectable sufficiently long before the  eruption starts for much to be done about it.

Among the ordinary soldiers, he said, everything could be spoken about: `The time of fanaticism and non-toleration of the views of others is past, and gradually one begins to think more clearly and coolly." 
Another letter, from February 1944, asked how many would still be alive to enjoy the day the Fu&umlaut.hrer had always <tag "537527">promised</> them, when `the sun would shine again".

The headline on a two-page special report in The Independent in January described East Europe as `A region where goalposts are on the move" &dash. and this was far from being an isolated view amongst East Europeans themselves, even at the beginning of the year. 
Nevertheless, the scenario at year-end remains breathtaking: Vaclav Havel as Czechoslovak President (and Alexander Dubcek as speaker of parliament); the Berlin Wall breached; Ceausescu executed; and free elections <tag "537527">promised</> everywhere except Albania (and, of course, the Soviet Union).  

800847
It is doubtful whether any system could succeed in these contradictory aims. 
However, the demand for the relevant, the practical, and the vocational that was part of the raison d'e&circ.tre of the GCSE has at the same time been answered in a different way, which may in the end prove embarrassing to the DES and the SEC, and may seem to <tag "537563">promise</> yet another shift of power.   

800848
I therefore favour a second view (which complements the first) according to which each person has an interest that promises made to him will be kept. 
Of course, he might lose interest in the specific content of some promises, and keeping some of them may even work against his overall interest. 
But invariably he has a pro tanto interest that <tag "538409">promises</> given to him be kept. 

800849
But, of course, without knowing much about the subject, it's hard to realise that local authorities haven't got the resources to check every element of construction and see that it conforms to the rules.

Over the last seven months, reality has intruded on all fronts. 
Where Mr Bush pledged to uphold Ronald Reagan's conservative legacy (opposing higher taxes and abortion), he has retreated or equivocated. 
Where he <tag "537527">promised</> to be kinder (education, the environment, social policy) he has been inactive or even cruel. 

800852
Last year it was $88,067 (#55,000) for 118th on the money list. 
But 1982 <tag "537527">promised</> more than financial riches.

These are the very same young people whom advocates of the present law would argue receive its `protection". 
We naturally welcome Labour's existing <tag "537566">promise</> to repeal Section 28 and to legislate against discrimination in the workplace.   

800854
The SNP is also launching a recruitment drive but its attacks on Labour seem likely to cause most controversy. 
Michael Russell, the party's vice-convener for publicity, accused Labour of selling out on all the <tag "538411">promises</> it made to Scottish voters at the last election.   

800855
Both Miss Kennedy and the commander hope the changes do not founder amid the problems Olins identified. 
She sees some <tag "537626">promise</>: `Since the programme was launched, there has been an intensive process of selling the idea internally; of recruiting others to the cause.

Each apparently believed it was the other trying to quietly strengthen his hand. 
So much for the professional, tightly-run business that was <tag "537527">promised</> when the new regime took over at Spurs in 1983.

There he promoted the Geneva Protocol, the most ingenious of many attempts to reconcile the French and British views of the League Covenant. 
It pledged the signatories to accept arbitration in international disputes ; pledged them also to disarm by agreement. 
In return they exchanged <tag "537566">promises</> of mutual support in case of unprovoked aggression.  

800858
Deadlock followed. 
In the end Hitler <tag "537527">promised</> not to act before 1 October, before which in any case his military plans would not mature.   

800859
There was also disappointment that no immediate action had followed such strong words, and lack of comprehension that Hitler needed any further powers to be granted. 
Further disappointment arose from Hitler's <tag "537566">promise</> of retaliation for the bombing of German cities, when, in the days that followed, only English towns such as Bath, Norwich, and York were reported as bombed. 

800860
However, Conservatives were united yesterday in condemning the weekend's riots. 
In his Commons statement, Mr Waddington said that about 3,000 `troublemakers" had remained in the Trafalgar Square area after the rest of Saturday's rally had dispersed. 
He condemned the `disgraceful criminal behaviour" and <tag "537527">promised</> that the police would `make every effort to bring to justice those who committed these appalling crimes." 

800861
The structure and imagery of Invisible Cities are immensely suggestive, perhaps dangerously so.

Many would love to know, for instance, whether there any clocks in the White House which show the time in Moscow, or Warsaw, or Budapest, because people wonder why Mr Bush and Company appear to be falling so far behind in their reaction to the pace of life in those cities. 
In short, after <tag "537527">promising</> to hit the ground running, people wonder why the President has become the leader of the Slow Is Beautiful Movement.

For these, Hitler's words were little consolation for the increasingly depressing outlook for Germany in the war. 
Only a fundamental improvement in the military situation, the implementation of drastic retaliation against Britain, and the creation of an effective defence against allied bombing &dash. a decisive transformation in war fortunes, in other words &dash. could have refurbished Hitler's tarnished popularity. 
In fact, however, new disappointments followed on Hitler's confident <tag "537566">promises</>: the bombing, almost unimpeded by German defences, intensified; the situation on the eastern Front worsened almost by the day; and in the west an invasion was expected at any time.

The single hydraulic pump was always one of the Apache's less attractive features because, if the left-hand engine failed after take-off, you had to operate the emergency handpump to raise the wheels at a time when it is essential to clean up the airframe without delay. 
Seen on the ground the Piper Apache is a chubby little bird, somewhat dated and rather sedate looking in comparison with its younger cousin, the Twin Comanche, but there is an impression of dependability and a <tag "537573">promise</> of comfort.

Between 1950 and 1961, the NFFC helped into production almost half the 730 British first feature films produced. 
The second government measure increased producers' bargaining power with financiers by reserving for British films a portion of the money taken at the domestic box office. 
Although the returns accruing to a particular film from the Eady Levy, as it was called, were limited both by the size of the box office in any particular year, and that film's success in the market-place (the levy was paid out in proportion to a film's success), the <tag "537626">promise</> it offered did make it easier for independents to raise cash.

Both purport to change the normative situation of another, and both purport to do so by voluntary acts undertaken in the belief that they have these normative consequences.

And when he brought down a pass from the wonderfully revived Gordon Cowans, half turned away from Steve Chettle, and slipped the ball under Mark Crossley for the winner, the point was perfectly made.

Promises quite often concern the actions of others: to consent to be governed by another is to promise to obey him; to consent to his joining the expedition is to promise to provide him with the facilities and the help made available to members of the expedition. 
Finally these examples in which to consent is to promise refute the suggestion that in one case the purpose is to confer rights and in the other to undertake an obligation.

Reflection on the analogous case of promises dispels this impression. 
There are times when making a certain promise (say to look after a friend's child if the friend dies before the child comes of age) are morally worthwhile but where one does not have an obligation to make them (remember that in this example too one may find other adequate ways to help one's friend). 
Certainly one is not under an obligation to look after the child if one did not <tag "537527">promise</> to do so just because it would have been a good thing to promise.

A dangerous crush followed a surge at the front of the stage and the security subsequently panicked.

He has obvious chances in the opener on Ardlui, a rare runner in Scotland for Sussex-based Guy Harwood, but may have to settle for second behind the Aga Khan's Daromann (1.45), who has the benefit of experience.

Fernando Collor de Mello glows with a fierce wattage as he brandishes clenched fists above the sea of dark, bobbing heads, urging them to follow him `shoulder to shoulder, heart to heart" into the polling booths to make him Brazil's youngest-ever president. 
Despite the roar of fireworks and the orchestrated flag-waving, the aristocratic Mr Collor's memorable eight-minute speech is a mere interlude for the more than 50,000 people gathered in front of Salvador's old fort and lighthouse.

Mr Cook, who does not deny that he is an isolated figure in the party leadership on this issue, told a Westminster press conference organised by the campaign: `It is quite clear that last year's debate at conference pulled the stopper out of the bottle and it cannot now be put back in again. 
`The trend in the Labour Party over the 10 months since the last conference has been a trend towards more open debate and a greater interest in electoral reform," added Mr Cook. 
The party leadership has already signalled a new flexibility since the 1989 conference by including in last month's policy review a <tag "537566">promise</> that the party will now consider a system other than first-past-the-post for the election of the European Parliament, for Labour's proposed new second chamber, and for its proposed regional assemblies, including the Scottish and Welsh Parliaments.

But there was no one to handle the pace after the first lap, unlike the women's mile, where Paula Ivan of Romania was ushered through to the three-quarter point of the mile at high speed and then went on to break Mary Slaney's world mark of 4:16.71, with 4:15.61. 
Murray, who won the 3,000m here last year, was <tag "537527">promised</> a pacemaker.

It is a tragic fact that the European debate, which is the most complex and important issue facing the countries of this continent, should be treated in such a facile manner, with the Trojan horse of `nationalism" and `sovereignty" wheeled out every time better arguments do not prevail. 
Europe has a destiny to fulfil, and in years to come it will become apparent that the best Europe is one which rejects interventionist mediocrity in favour of a European Community which will deliver the <tag "537566">promise</> of a higher standard of living and political pre-eminence so justly deserved by all Europeans.

They may never run in the Olympics, but at least they won't put me in goal on Christmas Day. 
THE British Southern Cross team of three made a powerful start to the Sydney to Hobart race yesterday while the race organisers could only hope that there would be no repeat of last year's devastation of the fleet by heavy winds and sea. 
While a big north-westerly made a spectacular start for the 126 yachts leaving Sydney Harbour it soon turned into the south, increased to between 30 and 40 knots and <tag "537527">promised</> a rugged opening night.

After searching the entire coast of Scotland and its environs I happened to glance down at the bottom left hand corner of the map and found them off the coast of Argentina! 
At 7pm I broke my <tag "538410">promise</> to myself and with a trembling hand I closed and locked my bedroom door, took my secret box out of my wardrobe and had a session of dressing up and posing in front of the mirror.

Sure enough, he was soon making a grab in the Health Secretary's most sensitive area. 
`Without resources," said Mr Cook, beginning to pursue the Health Secretary around the despatch box, `the plans you have announced are mere window-dressing."

The chancellor tied the abolition of duty to the planned arrival, in 1991-92, of the London stock exchange's Taurus. 
Though Mr Major called Taurus a dealing system, it is not: it is a paperless settlement system, which means it will be rather hard to put a stamp on anything. 
That is why, if the stock exchange had built Taurus many years ago, as <tag "537527">promised</>, it could also have ensured the earlier abolition of stamp duty.

Then there was the day of the fair.

In 1987, he more than any other minister ensured another election victory for the Government.

If Devereux's ankle has responded to physiotherapy since last night, so much the better -although the centres, Mike Hall and Brendan Mullin, both set to drop out, might not agree. 
Perhaps the most positive feature of yesterday's session was the gung-ho contribution of the captain, Finlay Calder, who <tag "537527">promised</> intense all-round commitment at Ballymore.

Rildia Bee is easy to spot from any distance because she always wears floor-length dresses of silk brocade and a mink stole &dash. which, air-conditioning or otherwise, is not necessarily the obvious choice of outfit in Fort Worth.

`The question of borders was not on the agenda.

The descriptions of battle, though almost minimalist in their economy, are effective; the Franky Furbo fantasies are convincingly realised; the typography, a different face for each speaker, is novel. 
And the story that seems to be emerging, of a man brought face to face with the truth, has <tag "537626">promise</>: at his wife's instigation, William goes to Germany to meet Wilhelm again, to find out what really happened in the war; Wilhelm confirms that Franky Furbo did indeed save them.

Tomorrow she would be back in Dublin. 
`To bring him once and for all to his senses' was like far-off thunder that could <tag "537563">promise</> any sort of weather.

There are the usual platitudes about class prejudice but Etienne Chatiliez, a successful director of commercials, displays in this, his first feature, too infirm a grasp of narrative structure to run any of the hares to ground. 
THE RACHEL PAPERS Martin Amis's first novel, originally published in 1973, charted the passage of the 19-year-old Charles Highway into adulthood, via carnal knowledge of the luscious Rachel, with a mix of self-loathing and self-regard. 
The film's highly misleading poster, all sassy Sixties-style graphics and buzzwords, <tag "537563">promises</> an upbeat yoof movie, but Amis's sour little story translates badly to the screen.   

800968
Last night's demonstration heard slogans more radical than the leadership can stomach. 
Freer travel has been <tag "537527">promised</>, but free elections &dash. as agreed to in Poland and Hungary &dash. are an impossibility if the East German state is to survive.

It is hard to call today as it was for the selectors in September.

The Politburo purge claimed two of East Germany's best-known hardliners, the ideological chief Kurt Hager, 77, and the State Security Minister, Erich Mielke, 81. 
The others sacked are the Central Committee secretary, Hermann Axen, 73, the First Deputy Prime Minister, Alfred Neumann, 79, and Erich Mueckenberger, 79, in charge of internal party discipline.

On Thursday, Colombian court officials went on strike to protest the recent slayings of judges and court workers.

Taxing THREE times, says a West Oxfordshire widow, she tried to tell her local council that her husband is dead and won't be paying the poll tax. 
So when she received yet another form asking for the registration of her late husband she complained to the Oxford Mail. 
When her complaint was passed on to the West Oxfordshire council's chief executive, he <tag "537527">promised</> immediate action and commented `I can understand how upsetting it is".

Jordan was approached by Villa chairman Doug Ellis while on holiday in Italy and said: `We spent most of a day together in Rome and the interview went very well.

`I <tag "537527">promised</> both clubs a decision when I returned from holiday.   

800976
There is no clear consensus among the professional US Kremlin-watchers on the state of the Soviet economy. 
Many of the US academics most often consulted by the politicians are being deliberately cautious, because their professional prestige was badly dented by their failure to predict the coming of a serious reformer like President Gorbachev and then, by their initial failure to take President Gorbachev's <tag "537566">promises</> of reform at all seriously.  

800977
Later she sat with Martha in a dirty interview room at the police station, still resplendent in her diamonds with her hair immaculately in place. 
She had given a statement and signed it, and accepted with subdued good grace the necessity to spend the night in a police cell. 
`I'll get you some sensible clothes," Martha <tag "537527">promised</>, noticing that grime had already attached itself to the hem of the dress.   

800978
PAUL SMITH, one of the leading figures in Warwickshire's NatWest Trophy win in September, is threatening to leave the county after being unable to agree terms for next season. 
The all-rounder said: `My new contract was for less money than I had been <tag "537527">promised</> for 1990.

The duo are likely to be kept apart until the Festival. 
Beech Road is set to begin his year in Newcastle's Fighting Fifth, with the Gerry Feilden Hurdle at Newbury pencilled in for Morley Street's seasonal debut &dash. both a week on Saturday. 
At the outset of a season which <tag "537656">promises</> much for his Hampshire yard, Balding's slight preference is for the champion.   

800980
The softening of the ground effectively renders much of this season's form obsolete, and a string of long-priced winners over the next few days is more than likely. 
Celtic Shot (1.15), however, will relish the newly arrived cut at Haydock today, and will start at long odds-on to confirm the <tag "537626">promise</> he showed when running Arkle Trophy winner Waterloo Boy to a neck at Chepstow last time.

Lord Stanley, whose amendment was inspired by the National Farmers" Union, said his concern was to put a specific duty on the Energy Secretary and the director general of electricity supplies to ensure that rural users `would pay at the same rate as anyone else", as at present. 
He accepted the <tag "537566">promise</> of the junior energy minister, Mr Michael Spicer, that the present situation will survive for at least five years after privatisation.

There is also the old question of cost. 
The Somerset Levels ESA <tag "537563">promises</> to absorb #1.5 million of the annual national cake of #4.3 million for ESAs in England and Wales in 1987-8.   

800986
He told her that he was replanning his life so that he could make more money to send her but that he could not leave the Army. 
He told her he was going to work and scrimp so that, when he was a middle-aged man, he could honestly say that everything he was or ever hoped to be he owed to his angel mother. 
Cheeks glazed with tears, he <tag "537527">promised</> her that, now that his rank had been increased, he would be able to increase the amount of money he had been sending to her in order to make up from what he would be costing them by refusing to resign from the Army and sign with the Morris Office.   

800987
That change will not happen overnight and since none of the conference recommendations is legally binding the establishment of a consensus is all-important. 
Delegates to the conference <tag "537527">promised</> to set up a survey on Antarctica which, by virtue of its isolation, is one of the `purest" research environments from which to study the `ozone hole" and its impact on atmospheric change.

It will be useless to make police stations look like building societies, and rename them cop shops, if the attitude of those working in them is unchanged. 
Indeed, <tag "537527">promising</> to do something and failing will further undermine public trust, already hard hit this autumn by a series of scandals.

There was besides a difference between raising money for party funds and peddling honours for his own account, as Lloyd George &dash. the man without a party &dash. seemed to be doing. 
He virtuously <tag "537527">promised</> reform, and a committee of elder statesmen was set up to scrutinize future recommendations &dash. probably to little serious effect.

The Meteorological Office, at Bracknell, Berkshire, is to become an executive agency in April 1990 under the Government's Next Steps Initiative, Michael Neubert, Minister for Defence Procurement, said.

The disciples of `managed trade" began to preach. 
Even the Bush administration, which has rejected the targeted, industry-by-industry response advocated by many in the US Congress, has <tag "537527">promised</> to produce its own Competitiveness agenda, following realese of the President's new budget in January.   

800993
Football trade magazines such as Shoot, Match, Football Monthly, World Soccer and newcomers like Inside Football have never been the epitome of style, and unsurprisingly little change is found here. 
It is magazines such as The Face, i-D, Blitz and Arena which have been engaging with football culture and have succumbed to the Latin <tag "537566">promise</> of theatre, spectacle and carnival.   

800994
That is what many Greeks are saying today as Conservatives and Communists find common cause. 
The Greek people are <tag "537527">promised</> another election in the autumn to sort out the left-right thing.

Most of the Communist Parties have renamed themselves, or are eager to do so and have renounced their leading role. 
Naturally, many <tag "538411">promises</> have been made before, and many have been broken.

The budget deficit is scheduled to fall from the present 10 per cent of GNP -proportionally double that of the US &dash. to at most 2.5 per cent in 1993.

It is his personal right. 
It will also mean that as each of us has an interest in an environment in which <tag "538409">promises</> are kept and people do not deceive each other, I, as well as everyone else, have a right that you shall keep your promises and that you shall not deceive other people.  

800998
In a brief statement, the party's Politburo said the talks could include the new electoral law, procedures for free elections and a reform of the constitution. 
Spokespersons for two of the main opposition groups, New Forum and Democratic Awakening, welcomed the proposals but said they would have to look closely to see if there were any conditions attached. 
The offer was the first step towards actually putting into practice the Communist <tag "537566">promises</> of free, secret, multi-party elections and constitutional reform.   

800999
There was a simple ordinariness about those brief appearances, during which Marcus enquired about Patrick's health; but how long could ordinariness continue and what would happen next? 
Ludens's own relations with Marcus might have been called, from Ludens's point of view, <tag "537614">promising</>, even satisfactory, were it not that they were also precarious.   

801000
I particularly object to your snide comment about `the self-styled caring image of the Labour Party." 
This caring image is based on performance in that the Oxfordshire Labour Party in both the 1985 and 1989 election manifestos <tag "537527">promised</> a countywide bus pass scheme and the Labour transport spokesperson initiated such a scheme in 1987 on the basis of a shared cost with the district councils.

The rest of the time we've had rain, all-enveloping mist, temperatures I last remember experiencing in February and the odd sunny spell. 
Yesterday afternoon was hot enough for the beach, and the weather forecast <tag "537563">promised</> more of the same.   

801002
Administration officials have told a Congressional sub-committee that they are looking for further `areas in which we can reach understandings". 
The new policy was first signalled by President Bush in his inaugural address in January but has been pursued more vigorously since the rise to power of President Rafsanjani and some <tag "537614">promising</>, indirect contacts with Iran during the August hostage crisis in Lebanon.   

801003
So many films are bad for all the wrong reasons, because of the writer's vanity, the director's pride or the producer's bad temper and, as long as that's the reality of British filmmaking, there's no hope of building on the brief moments of achievement in the national cinema, or creating a cinema that really speaks to people. 
And a cinema that doesn't do that isn't worth anything at all. 
In 1955, former nightclub hostess Ruth Ellis went to the gallows for killing David Blakely, a man whose wealthy origins and good looks had seemed to <tag "537527">promise</> her a rise up the social scale.

When one looks at this, it's surprising what little guidance in the day-to-day practice of medicine it offers. 
Significantly, one of the few specific <tag "537566">promises</> called for is: ` 1 will give no deadly medicine to anyone if asked, nor suggest such counsel."   

801007
Mrs Marcos went on trial in New York this week, on March 20th, by coincidence the day on which the contents of her letter to Mr Bush was disclosed. 
Like all of the Marcos affairs, the trial <tag "537563">promises</> to be complex.

A LATE rally by Cheetahs pulled off a fine victory in their Sunbrite League speedway clash at Saddlebow Road on Saturday. 
And once again it was dynamic Martin Dugard who was the star of the show with some brilliant speedway, none more so than the last heat victory that settled the issue for Oxford. 
Dugard, one of three Oxford riders left in the world championship chase, again gave his all and the two scraps he had with home favourite and equally <tag "537614">promising</> youngster Mark Loram were memorable to say the least.   

801009
THE Railway Children have steamed in with their new LP, Native Place (Virgin) &dash. and like British Rail trains, it failed to arrive on time and is slightly old-fashioned. 
The album doesn't really live up to the promise of the single, Every Beat of the Heart, an excellent pop number which is the highlight of this collection. 
But it's a pleasant enough bunch of tunes &dash. and maybe if multitalented songwriter and lead singer Gary Newby, who produced the aforementioned single and designed the album's record sleeve, is allowed to produce more of his songs in the studio, the band could live up to their undoubted <tag "537626">promise</>. 

801010
American disinterest in their fate has meant the stalling of negotiations with the PLO towards a settlement and the apparently indefinite toleration by the West of their ill-treatment at Israeli hands. 
In Saddam they see a strong leader who, for once, puts into action what he <tag "537527">promises</>.

Eventually he came to the conclusion that the reviews were no help either. 
The same reviewers whose acclaim had seemed excessive to him when the first book appeared were equally enthused by its successors. 
Because he was no longer a newcomer, they were obliged to stop mentioning <tag "537626">promise</> in favour of (and how he disliked this) `reliable'.  

801012
Men supposed that they were somehow shifting the cost of the war on to the shoulders of future generations. 
Actually, in physical terms, the war had to be paid for while it was on, and war loans &dash. unlike increased direct taxes &dash. were merely a <tag "537566">promise</> that any sacrifice made by the wealthier classes would be temporary. 

801013
In conventional planning, this would mean that Sweden should build new power plants that burn coal or oil, to replace the nuclear power. 
But Sweden has also <tag "537527">promised</> that in 20 years its emissions of carbon dioxide ({subscript base=CO, sub=2}), the main greenhouse gas, will have dropped to 1986 levels.

The addiction is to the `rush" &dash. an experience of great pleasure which lasts a relatively short time. 
In my own case, the motivation to stop free-basing followed the realisation that what crack <tag "537566">promises</> in the rush is never delivered.

BERISFORD International shareholders can only hope that the apparent ceding of management control by Ephraim Margulies to Bristar's Peter Jacobs, who becomes group chief executive, is indeed the end of an era. 
Shareholders and analysts, who have long been hardened to the succession of nasties to emerge from the non-edible operations stemming from an irresistible urge to makes deals, will also be grateful if Berisford, as <tag "537527">promised</>, decides to concentrate on its Bristar food business.

Mr Fatchett said the party would not lay down how much time should be spent on physical education or lay down attainment targets but would stress these values for all pupils. 
He blamed the teachers" industrial action three years ago for contributing to a decline in school sports matches and said the party would talk to teachers" organisations to find ways of reinstituting out-of-school activities, without <tag "537527">promising</> extra payments for overtime.

He claimed to have documentary proof that the Board was not bankrupt in 1987, as is generally thought, but was `bullied, double-crossed and deceived out of #300,000" by officers of the Amateur Athletic Association which was able then to emerge as the dominant body. 
`If this is true, history has been wickedly distorted," Sir Arthur Gold, author of the Board's history who <tag "537527">promised</> to investigate, said.   

801023
A plan to build a superstore and garden centre at Broadlands in Hampshire, the former home of the late Lord Mountbatten, has been rejected by Chris Patten, the Environment Secretary, overturning a decision of the inquiry inspector. 
During the inquiry, Lord Romsey <tag "537527">promised</> he would spend #9m on urgent restoration work on his estate, but that the income from visitors to Broadlands was insufficient to carry out the renovations.

From the quotes on previous pages, only one stood out as surprising. 
As one who was so instrumental in mapping out the future <tag "537573">promise</> of early Smiths, his quote `If you asked me to write something about The Smiths now it would probably be critical", remained interesting.

But unlike India's last three elections, there were no crises to contend with this time, or brave new causes to fight for.

It's much too late to make a pitch on consistency no one person knows or understands more than a fraction of one discipline among many anymore.

Steffan Pandya and Tanya Groves, who are hopefuls for the 1992 Olympics, also played well, despite losing in three games.

Concurrently many Tories who would be happy to rid themselves of a certain vote-loser are deterred by the risk of the party falling apart. 
Non-political onlookers have reason to be concerned at the damage the nation may suffer if it is to be subjected for two more years to the whims of a Prime Minister who constantly <tag "537527">promises</> to remain out of step with the rest of the world.

This is now the fourth change in the side beaten last weekend by the North and potentially the one that severely reduces their chances of bucking the trend.

In the end all three major participants Nashwan, Indian Skimmer and Warning, came under starter's orders after each in turn during the five days prior to the race had at one stage or another appeared a doubtful runner. 
So seldom in racing do these <tag "537625">promised</> clashes of the giants materialise that Saturday's race proved an outstanding exception.

For 22 years of my married life I maintained these two old people." 
Two men from poor northern city backgrounds, who later became very wealthy, tried to set up their elderly parents in comfort: Andrew Carnegie, American millionaire bachelor, gave his Scots mother, `my best friend and trustiest counsellor", a house and a carriage and pair as he had <tag "537527">promised</> her when young, while a Manchester mill-owner failed to persuade his old mother to spend more than #1 a week, but `would pet her like the sweetheart she was."

It was Wiesenthal who discovered the existence of ODESSA, a secret organisation which smuggled ex-SS members to South America. 
When Frederick Forsyth wanted to write a thriller around this, Wiesenthal agreed to help on condition that he place a genuine Nazi &dash. Roschmann &dash. at the centre of the plot. 
Forsyth <tag "537527">promised</> to put in a sequence that would lose Roschmann the sympathy of former comrades, but refused to let him escape unpunished, as the real Roschmann had.

Falkirk W) protested. 
He said a new 25-millilitre measure introduced to replace the existing choice of measures `normally a quarter or a fifth of a gill in Scotland and a sixth of a gill in England" was `a slight increase in the normal measures served in an English pub but a decrease of about 12 per cent in the average measure in a Scottish pub".

Rogue builders are cashing in on the recent storms to make big profits with bogus repairs, according to insurance experts. 
`Not only have the recent storms left many people with damaged property, they have also led to the disturbing increase in the number of rogue builders who are turning the miserable situation to their advantage," says London-based RCC Insurance Brokers.

Not all of us find the energy to rouse ourselves for supper, but the next day we all manage the seven-hour hike back to the Kibo Hotel which lives up to its boast of having endless supplies of hot water. 
Then a farewell dinner and next-day partings, <tag "537566">promises</> of exchanged photographs and visits to Miami and California and we all return with a jolt and the unavoidable sense of anticlimax, to our respective realities.

Home shopping by catalogue has always been a downmarket activity in this country and has been hit hard by current economic conditions.

Andrew showed Gloucester how the wind should have been used early on in the second half and, with Mark Bailey's irresistible running again raising the question of his ridiculous under-use by England, the atmosphere soon changed from competitive league game to Wasps exhibition. 
Bailey galloped in for three tries and made a fourth &dash. the best of the game -turning a break from the 22 by the <tag "537614">promising</> Steve Pilgrim into a surge down the middle and then slipping the ball out to Simon Smith.

In their encampment in the square, the hunger strikers said they would continue their protest against a new administration they describe as merely the old regime under a different name. 
Despite all the protest that his Salvation Front was too closely linked with the old communists, President Iliescu now almost certainly has a clear mandate to govern Romania. 
The first test of his <tag "537566">promise</> that the bad old days are gone will be the manner in which he treats people like these, who continue to exercise their right to criticise his government.

The secondary threat that Dunwoody would be dispatched to Wetherby to accompany Long Engagement in the Castleford Chase on the same day has also been defused, as Nicholson has booked Brendan Powell for that trip.

But the reform programme now seeks its inspiration in the past rather than the future. 
Traumatised by the political turmoil of June and alarmed by a deepening economic crisis, the party has turned to Mr Chen's conservative credo in a desperate attempt to recapture what it regards as the golden age of Chinese communism &dash. the brief period from 1949 until 1957, when Mao began to go off the rails.

The latest flare-up in the feud centres on mounting concern about the financing of the club, which is the only football club in the United Kingdom with a full Stock Exchange listing. 
Analysts at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the stockbroking firm that advises Tottenham, played down reports that Spurs were in debt to the tune of more than #10m and estimated the figure at #8m. 
Even that amount will worry supporters and shareholders, as well as manager Terry Venables, who was <tag "537527">promised</> that the non-footballing side of Spurs business would enable him to fund the creation of a championship winning team.

Notable by its absence, though, will be Nicholas Hytner's revelatory Kent Opera staging of Tippett's third opera, King Priam, which was booked to make a guest appearance at Covent Garden in February: alas, Kent Opera is no more and will be sorely missed in the nation's already constricted operatic life.

Squires recommended Arthur Sandford, chief executive of Nottinghamshire County Council, some weeks ago, but his appointment was delayed until yesterday because Bill Fox, the League president, favoured Gordon Taylor, of the Professional Footballers' Association. 
Fox had <tag "537527">promised</> the job to the players' union secretary in August as a plank in his own election platform, only to be overruled by the committee, who insisted that Taylor should be interviewed, along with the three other shortlisted candidates.

The discipline of the telling is maintained, but what is told has a far more gratifying formlessness. 
The consequence of this is that meaning pops out again on a higher level: abandoning right and wrong, he has made room for a taste of good and evil.

And, even in a Stock Market now hardened to shocks and crashes, there can be few companies which include in their interim profit statement the fact that one member of staff was shot dead and another wounded in El Salvador while going about their everyday business. 
Behind that tragic loss of staff as well as the loss of people through the more legitimate, albeit painful, process of redundancy, Reuters' yesterday emerged with better profits, improved trading margins and a <tag "537625">promised</> array of product innovations.   

801116
The organisers Matthews and Powell liked what they saw and invited Charlotte, a pupil at Oxford Girl's School, to London to find out more about fashion and make-up modelling. 
Charlotte, pictured right, said: `I just went along for a joke, they said they were quite keen to accept me because I had a lot of <tag "537626">promise</>."  

801117
An unofficial trade union leader said that, in view of the government's response, today's general strike has been called off.

They are able to offer facilities which are more attractive for spectators than those provided by football clubs, and to provide their `amateur" players with considerable expenses in lieu of salaries. 
There are many other ways of subsidising <tag "537614">promising</> players. 

801119
Holly continued. 
`I interpreted that to mean he was lonely and you caught him hanging around in a pub." Laughing, Rain shooed Holly into the kitchen, <tag "537527">promising</> to tell as much as she could about Alf Wilson but only if they could eat while she did so, Holly refreshed Fred's bowl of water and made a fuss of him while Rain cooked.   

801120
The Nigerian Labour Party and the Republican Party of Nigeria came bottom with 17 points apiece. 
Publication of these results had raised an expectation that the two associations which showed the most <tag "537626">promise</> would be accepted for registration.

He could not believe what he was looking upon.

Youngsters in Mexico City are finally able to see nearby volcanoes they have only heard about before.

Winterburn, too, provided his customary sharpness on the left, and Tony Adams maintained his new habit of passing the ball accurately. 
The young Arsenal captain is back in peak form, even if one suspects his international prospects will always be limited while he keeps trying to tackle through the back of opponents' legs. 
In creative terms, Arsenal <tag "537563">promised</> more than was delivered, Rocastle often stirring the crowd with technical wizardry only to let them down with an aimless pass, but I still thought Graham's verdict a shade harsh, and indeed misguided when he added: `We never seem to do our best after international matches."   

801125
The previous chapter surveyed some intuitions and examined some arguments. 
The arguments were found wanting, but one or two of them seemed <tag "537614">promising</>.   

801126
That comes after growing Irish annoyance at the continued failure of the British to ensure that the RUC accompanies the UDR on all its operations. 
The British Government has <tag "537527">promised</> tighter vetting of recruits to the UDR.

SEA CONTAINERS, Sir James Sherwood's beleaguered Bermuda-based ferry and cargo group, is expected to make an announcement this morning following a board meeting in London yesterday. 
On 6 October Sea Containers <tag "537527">promised</> that by the end of the month it would make public a `recommended alternative" to the hostile tender offer by Temple Holdings which would involve significant asset sales.   

801128
The Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay, president of the association, yesterday assured the magistrates that while the Governemnt was determined to improve the efficiency of their courts it would safeguard their independence. 
He also <tag "537527">promised</> to give magistrates the same immunity from civil actions arising from court cases that judges enjoy.   

801129
This was the first election since Rupert Murdoch bought the paper in 1987. 
Mr Goss accepted victory before cheering supporters in the crowded Brisbane election tally room on Saturday night, when he declared: `This is the end of the Bjelke-Petersen era." 
Mr Goss <tag "537527">promised</> to make the Fitzgerald inquiry's recommendations for the reform of the electoral and criminal justice systems the top priority of his administration.   

801130
He recognized that the French had genuine, though in his opinion groundless, fears. 
He sought to remove these fears by promises of British support which, he was confident, would never be called on. 
The <tag "537566">promises</>, `black and big on paper" , were a harmless drug to soothe nerves.   

801131
They would perhaps skate over the fact that TSB was judged not to belong to anybody so, unlike the Abbey National case, its members neither had any say in the flotation nor any profit from it. 
But they would have a field day with the <tag "538411">promises</> made and the record since flotation.   

801132
Mozambique's attempts to reach peaceful solutions had been wrecked by deliberate South African policy, he added. 
Even after the signing of a non-aggression treaty with South Africa in 1984: `The desired climate of coexistence was not achieved; it was frustrated by hostile forces who found ways of continuing with the same policy, despite the <tag "538411">promises</> made." 

801133
One of the Palestinian guerrillas turned irritably to a companion and asked: `Why don't we shoot at them?" 
Had he not heard the Arab League spokesman that morning, <tag "537527">promising</> that the Syrian `peace-keepers" would `strike with an iron fist" at any resistance?   

801134
Eileen had sat a little apart from them, lamenting that she had never been that young or that carefree. 
Now, out on the terrace again, staring into the thicket of mist and unnerved by the screaming gulls, she makes herself a firm <tag "538411">promise</> to go home.   

801135
If your father were an out-of-work actor and he dressed up as a formidably grand housekeeper and babysitter, would your mum recognise him? 
Well, anyway, I <tag "537527">promise</> it makes a splendid read.

The ATP Tour Championship next year offers a prize of dollars 2m to be divided between the top eight players in the rankings. 
A private West German television company, SAT 1, will pay more than dollars 5.2m per year to broadcast the tournament and other ATP events in Germany, and the mayor of Frankfurt, Dr Volker Hauff, has <tag "537527">promised</> to `showcase" the event with a week of concerts, exhibitions and international symposiums. 

801137
The picture is similar in the Kuzbass coalfield in Kemerovo region in central Siberia, where last summer's strikes began in July. 
Miners, union and party officials are discussing how Moscow is honouring its <tag "537566">promises</>. 

801138
Mr Ryzhkov's message, to striking and non-striking coalfields alike, was released here yesterday by the Tass news agency. 
He <tag "537527">promised</> a meeting of top officials here on 17 November to consider how the August agreements were being implemented and he appealed to the `reason and honour" of miners throughout the country to `ensure the normal life of the Soviet people" this winter. 

801139
`We always knew exactly what criteria we wanted fulfilled by the candidates, and to talk about undue delay is wrong because it was not until the Wednesday before the interviews that we were presented with the four names on the shortlist and their full CVs. 
`To say we <tag "537527">promised</> the job to Gordon Taylor is also incorrect.

Page 27 DRG FORECAST: 
The stationery group has <tag "537527 or 537584">promised</> a profits forecast to rally support against the #697m bid from Pembridge Investments.   

801141
But union negotiators rejected the proposal, claiming the invitation demanded that the ambulance staff end their work-to-rule. 
In their rejection letter the unions repeated their earlier <tag "537566">promise</> that they could guarantee a full emergency service provided calls were put through to stations, where crews were ready and waiting to work. 

801142
But she was too bright and restless with happiness, the newly-stirred memories, to be gone over, noted and enjoyed, for any unhappiness merely because soup was denied her. 
Miss Cress had a well-bred, kindly face, tasteful calf handbag and gloves. 
She had made a firm <tag "538411">promise</>.   

801143
It states quite clearly in the instructions for Playskools `My First Fishing Rod" that crappies should be feeding wildly near lilypads about this time of year. 
My friend naughty Nigel's seven-year-old son now rates me lower than the purple rubber earthworm which comes with his fishing set simply because I have been unable to catch a fish which does not exist in this country. 
It all started with a foolish <tag "538411">promise</> made under alcoholic duress at a Christmas party.   

801144
The Cranko response to that was `(Bitter laugh) Ha! 
(And then wistfully, turning on the full power of my innocent blue eyes) Yes, I'm afraid many people think that." 
Then, `after a great deal more chit-chat I let him kiss me a tender goodnight on the doorstep with the <tag "537566">promise</> to phone when he could and, gathering up my ermines, swept into the great portal.   

801145
`Life becomes daily more unpleasant.

Radford is especially keen to help Worcestershire to victory against the county which released him in 1984 after five unproductive seasons. 
This year's Benson final <tag "537563">promises</> to be one of the best, with the clash of probably the two best all-round one-day sides in the country.   

801147
But the approach to debt still lacks the world-wide commitment it needs to be effective. 
Japan has <tag "537527">promised</> to spend an extra $35 billion on recycling funds to developing countries, which will extend its present programme until 1991.   

801148
Only a handful have accepted and agreed to vacate their seats. 
The party has <tag "537527">promised</> to retire them all within the next decade, confident that with an average age well over 80, few will survive that long.   

801149
`Some were confused at first, but they can accept it." 
Such mental gymnastics can be found everywhere in Yantai, a port city with economic ambitions and free of any sense of loyalty to the man who helped make such ambitions possible. 
Outside the town in an Economic and Technical Development Zone &dash. land set aside for capitalist investment &dash. the rhetoric of orthodox Marxism mixes easily with <tag "537566">promises</> of cheap labour, high profits and assurances of how easy it is to sack lazy workers.  

801150
Manufacturing processes which employ the very latest technology ensure high quality products which will give many years of reliable service. 
The result is a range of cookers that combine the very best from both the past and the present, continuing the Stoves <tag "537566">promise</> &dash. `We make cookers for cooks".

She praised the college staff for coping with the situation.

Harmon asked for a move after losing his first-team place to Bob Jackson, an Australian in his second spell at Wilderspool, but Oldham and St Helens will be among teams disappointed to learn that Warrington do not intend to list him. 
Eric Latham, the new chairman of St Helens, has <tag "537527">promised</> money will be found to sign new players.   

801153
You could say it is envy, and indeed that is partly true, And I won't pretend that a factor in one's accepting such an invitation is not the thought of spending a week in a grand hotel. 
On this occasion, as an added piquancy, the festival <tag "537563">promised</> to have a distinctly radical flavour. 

801155
He again appealed to the East German Communist party to give up its monopoly of power and open the way for free elections. 
Then, he <tag "537527">promised</>, West Germany would be ready to offer assistance.   

801156
Labour does not need a commitment to proportional representation in order to scoop most of the centre ground at the next general election. 
All it needs is to promise a high-powered investigation, such as a Royal Commission, into the practicalities of an alternative voting system (surely justified by the intense public interest now abounding). 
Such a <tag "537566">promise</> would be the only hope of a breakthrough for the disenfranchised voters and would have them flocking to the polls for Mr Kinnock.   

801157
Alice worked for two years for this member of the Kuwaiti royal family. 
Her contract was completed but, as with many others in her situation, she was not sent home as <tag "537527">promised</>.   

801158
Oxford backs dominated with tries from Sally Roycroft, Beverly Penny (2) and a 50-yard score from winger Erica Tyler. 
OXFORD Polytechnic Ladies were unlucky to go down 8-0 to St Paul's and St Mary's, Cheltenham, but in a fast and furious game the Poly ladies showed a lot of <tag "537626">promise</> for the future.  

801159
Anyway, it was thanks to Harry that she was here on Shepherd's Hill, and it was a nice part, a comparatively clean part, even &dash. workmen's radios and burglar alarms excepted &dash. a quiet part, having its streets so choked with parked cars and vans that nothing on four wheels could hurry and heavier vehicles tried to by-pass it. 
But across the garishly painted railway bridge, where all traffic was now prohibited, the tube station <tag "537563">promised</> infallible noise, noise enough and to spare. 

801160
Prices range from dollars 40,000 to dollars 60,000 ( #25,600 to #38,400) each, and some images are already sold out. 
The Raab Gallery in Vauxhall Bridge Road, London, has a show of work by one of the most <tag "537614">promising</> of the newest generation of Scottish artists, Stephen Barclay.   

801161
The Polish alliance embedded Great Britain in east European affairs. 
Yet the British government had no means of fulfilling their bargain. 
In practical terms, their <tag "537566">promise</> could only mean that the French, who had been committed without prior consultation, would not desert Poland, as they had deserted Czechoslovakia.   

801162
They were supposed to be replaced by permanent buildings as soon as money could be raised by the sale of the old site. 
This was <tag "537527">promised</> a long 10 years ago.   

801163
It had to be refined and updated, she conceded, but `unilateral action is still the only certain way in which we can say we will have a non-nuclear defence for Britain." 
Ms Ruddock attacked Mr Kinnock's claim that no British government could say whether it would use Trident by countering: `No responsible leader would ever countenance the use of nuclear weapons on another nation." 
She admitted that the party machine was now likely to deliver the vote for a switch in policy at conference, and she <tag "537527">promised</> as a front bench spokeswoman to abide by the party's democratic decisions.   

801164
More than one and a half million people drawing benefit, earnings rising at almost 10 per cent a year, and unemployment on the verge of an upturn. 
The theory has failed; the <tag "538410">promise</> has been broken.

Unless there's some fresh fruit." 
`We'll have a look," he <tag "537527">promised</>.   

801166
The two of them made their vows, `as ye will answer at the dreadful day of judgement when the secrets of all hearts shall &and. disclosed". 
They <tag "537527">promised</> to keep themselves only unto themselves, in sickness and in health, so long as they both should live.   

801167
How attractive such a view would seem, dressed in more sophisticated and tough analytical clothes. 
A just cause and it <tag "537563">promises</> later electoral success, provided everything is thrown at the enemy and his swift defeat is assured.

With 200,000 having left East Germany this year alone, the army has been brought in to maintain public transport, food deliveries and hospital services. 
In West Germany, an Interior Ministry official <tag "537527">promised</> last night that no one would be turned back from the East. 

801169
In population terms this territory is bigger than Norway, Denmark, Finland or Israel, or 70 other voting members of the United Nations. 
Whitehall and Peking did a grubby deal: Britain <tag "537527">promised</> to hand all of Hong Kong over to China in 1997; Peking pledged that the colony would enjoy a new status as an autonomous special administrative region of China, governed by its own people under a democratic system enshrining the Rule of Law and the common-law justice system.

Looking thoughtful, Nevil moved away. 
He'd <tag "537527">promised</> to relieve Andy Ramsay at the second-hand book stall.

`We don't want to stabilise the existing regime but we don't want a destabilisation which could lead to incalculable risks," said a close aide of the Chancellor. 
Chancellor Kohl has <tag "537527">promised</> generous aid to support reforms in East Germany.   

801172
The dynamic years were over: Lloyd George out, Northcliffe dead. 
Law, a Canadian, <tag "537527 or 537584">promised</> `tranquillity" ; Astor, an American, made The Times once more respectable &dash. and `stodgy" .

Inwardly lie groaned. 
What a time to fall sick!

Whitley Bay, the Geordie club chasing promotion to the HFS Loans League's top flight, will have scribes reaching for the `once-proud" prefix if they dispatch Preston in front of a capacity 4,500 at Hillheads Park. 
One of their players, Lawrie Pearson, has <tag "537527">promised</> the plastic-pitch practitioners from the Third a rough ride, `especially if the wind blows off the sea and a spot of rain makes our ground heavy".   

801175
The singing does not always have the breadth and depth it has had in previous years. 
And a couple of <tag "537614">promising</> comic musical numbers, Rooks and Mr Brown, Miss Suzanne, are spoilt because we have difficulty hearing the words. 

801176
This has not, however, prevented a touching detail in the exodus of the original 4,000 emigres over the weekend. 
As they left the embassy, those who had arrived in cars were invited to leave their keys, and in return were <tag "537527">promised</> that their vehicles would be brought eventually to the West.   

801177
Voters want to know what their plans are. 
Then they will decide for themselves whether the Tory <tag "537566">promises</> of Poll Tax cuts are pie in the sky &dash. or worthy of their support at the ballot box.   

801178
That presumably was why Mr Gorbachev asked him along. 
THE RISK of crippling new disruption in the sorely-pressed Soviet coal industry grew yesterday as miners walked out in nine of the 13 pits in the Arctic city of Vorkuta, in protest at the government's failure to honour its <tag "537566">promises</> which ended last summer's nationwide strikes. 

801179
Afternoon of unusual peace, as Harriet and Henry are to be conveyed by another parent directly from school to Julian's birthday party which is to be Within Tent.

He made the pronouncement with the same intelligent ironic tone he had used (so Patty related it) two years earlier, when he first saw the somewhat ornate Victorian engagement ring that my widowed maternal grandmother had given me to give to her, and he had said, `Well! &dash. it's certainly not vulgarly discreet." 
But the Bug's nose, its infantile tininess combining with its monstrous <tag "537626">promise</>, was at the moment one of her nicest features, and the best thing about it was what it shared with all babies' noses: not the gargoylian turn of its wings, which was from Patty's parents, nor the palpable bump at the bridge, which might at puberty bulk itself into a `Beal Breakfront," as those who had married into my mother's family, the Beals, had called it among themselves Lor several generations &dash. no, what was finest about the Bug's nose was the same amazing thing I had noticed at age five when shown a neighbor's newborn: it was so clean inside. 

801181
Promise me you'll never leave me." 
He held her closely to him, feeling her heart still surging from her climax, infuriated by her cast-down eyes and melancholy expression. 
`I <tag "537527">promise</>," she whispered.  

801182
We were paralysed by our prejudices. 
We suspected her of having let the side down by <tag "537527">promising</> all sorts of privileges and services wives weren't supposed to deliver any more.   

801183
Beineix's camera, following the unpredictable prowling of the big cat, is freed from the stylised deliberation that worked so well in Diva and has become such a burden since. 
There are moments of grace and humour in the new film, but in the absence of an underlying architecture they are wasted. 
Beineix introduces <tag "537614">promising</> characters &dash. a muscleman who resents the young couple and supplies dangerous animals, a German tiger tamer at the Munich circus who makes life difficult for them &dash. then drops them with perverse lack of drama.   

801184
`I know you don't want Chile to revert to mediocrity: you want liberty and progress," he told an estimated 150,000 supporters who packed the streets surrounding one of the city's central squares. 
Regarded as the architect of Chile's relative economic stability, Mr Buchi <tag "537527">promised</> jobs, education and material gains. 

801185
The Shepherd-Hire office was only two streets away and sometimes you got a minicab in two minutes, sometimes in two to the power of several. 
This evening he was in luck, or so it <tag "537563">promised</>.   

801186
The losses are on the roundabouts and the swings: outside the World Cup ambit, conventional upmarket tourism has tended to stay away this year &dash. hotel bookings are markedly down, with those anxious to see such sights as Masaccio's restored and unveiled frescoes in Florence apparently suffering from the idea that the Carmine Chapel will be a stage for the Chelsea Shed versus the Ajax Amsterdam Krazy Boys. 
All this is particularly ironic, because hoteliers had presumed that the World Cup would be a bonanza and have made improvements to their properties, spending what their federation calculate to be #2 billion. 
But again, the state sector is obliged to come to some kind of rescue, for a law was passed last year <tag "537527">promising</> grants of about #500 million towards all World Cup-related hotel improvement schemes.   

801187
At Newbury this afternoon Hern's Gold Seam (2.00) must have a good chance in the Aldbourne Maiden Stakes. 
This colt has not run since the spring but showed abundant <tag "537626">promise</> when fifth to Great Commotion at Newmarket.  

801188
He added: `We had extra men in the area; whether the residents could see them or not, they were there." 
Young Muslims in Ryan Street and the terraces off it plan to film any future hit-and-run raids. 
And Mr Mawson, warning against vigilante protection, <tag "537527">promised</> that all resources necessary would be deployed to stop attacks.   

801189
We'd get to one poem four or five days into the war, or after The Belgrano or Sir Galahad, and then you have `Lie Still" &ellip. which is sombre, like a tribute, and then the others, like `Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night", which started off as a camp throwaway as a tango; but the poems put together with an orchestra gives them much more depth." 
Besides two short piano pieces from Sanctus, Words For The Dying also includes the luminous The Soul of Carmen Miranda, one of three spontaneous and highly <tag "537614">promising</> recordings with Eno that will set the tone for the next album, `a rock'n'roll record I can be happy with because the percussion won't hit me over the head."   

801190
Again, according to the received journalistic wisdom, on the Immigration and Refugee Bills, and the Unemployment Insurance Bill, the Senate should have passed them, unamended, in jig-time. 
Why bother about the poor and the persecuted? 
But instead the Senate also subjected these bills to intense scrutiny, to prolonged hearings of experts in the field concerned, and proposed a string of amendments to make the legislation more effective, more humane, and better able to stand up to what <tag "537563">promised</> to be formidable challenges in the courts.   

801191
What chance would I have of persuading the police?" 
Gerrard started reiterating his plea for Gower to abandon pretence, but Gower interrupted him to demand what had happened to the #10,000 he had requested. 
Gerrard said: `I never <tag "537527">promised</> to pay it, John.   

801192
I have to, I need to go big job." 
Of course we had each been vaguely aware of intervals before that moment when the other had disappeared into the bathroom and then reappeared with a slightly uneasy look, and we may even have occasionally spoken of the act of `number two," but Patty's forthright statement, using an idiom that was quite new to me, which she said she had learned visiting friends once in Minnesota (and in that offering of novelty supplying another instance of why I needed her in my life), held the thrilling <tag "537566">promise</> that now that we were engaged, we would be in no doubt about the specific purpose of our trips to the bathroom.   

801193
With hindsight he may have acted differently. 
`Certainly <tag "538411">promises</> were made when Michael Knighton came to the club and doubts have now been cast on his ability to fulfil these, but if he does everything he has said who is to complain?"   

801194
BY A small margin, Benazir Bhutto yesterday defeated a motion of no confidence in her government. 
But the opposition <tag "537527">promised</> to carry on its offensive against her, and continuing political uncertainty will make government difficult.   

801195
My other half, who reckons she knows a thing or two about oil painting, was explaining how a particular artist managed to produce wonderful seascapes but to discover the secret you need to get quite close to the canvas. 
I did no more than lean across the rope for a quick glimpse when a booming voice issued the public warning. 
I guess it's a pretty boring job so I <tag "537527">promised</> to behave. 

801196
In the Ukraine, however, resentment about conditions and the failure of local party leaders to do anything, is still riding high. 
Despite government <tag "537566">promises</> that everything granted to the Kuzbass miners would also apply to the Donbass, the strike has spread since Monday morning, when only six pits were closed. 

801197
He said the reforms to date were only `an interim situation". 
Yesterday's EC statement acknowledged the importance of foreign investment once a new political settlement had been agreed &dash. a point which British officials seized upon as consistent with the Thatcher line. 
The Prime Minister declared that the future was only as <tag "537614">promising</> as it is for South Africa `because some of us stood out the entire time against comprehensive sanctions and won".   

801198
The trouble is, that's impossible. 
You see, Chris the Stuffer's deep freezes are so full that a while back, I <tag "537527">promised</> him I would take the overflow.   

801199
Perhaps things have been expected of him too early, but the lad made his bow for Cheetahs with an enormous reputation. 
Compared with other youngsters in the sport, namely Joe Screen and Mark Loram, he has yet to fulfill that <tag "537626">promise</> at the highest level.   

801200
Indeed it was an excellent day for Oxford. 
There was a fine victory for <tag "537614">promising</> Kelly Dodgson in the bronze girls under 12 event.

In Division 2 Oracle stopped Thame D's run of nine wins by 2-1 with Barry Lally and Howard Stone doing the damage.

Eduard Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister, <tag "537527">promised</> an early response when he met James Baker, the US Secretary of State, in Copenhagen earlier this week.

I said: `Mr Faribault, no Leader can give you that pledge. 
He can promise you a seat in the Cabinet. 
But the minute he <tag "537527">promises</> you a particular portfolio, he makes enemies of every one of the seven or eight other men who want that portfolio."

The American was ranked No. 32 in the world less than a year ago, but leg and back injuries intervened and temporarily halted a most <tag "537614">promising</> career.

In stark contrast, yesterday's statement from the East German Foreign Ministry said: `We need every man and every woman, and we are willing to find out and eradicate the reasons that have led to so many people turning their backs on us." 
East Germans wanting to return were urged to apply to the country's diplomatic missions abroad and `providing no important reasons stand in their way", the Foreign Ministry <tag "537527">promised</> to help them `find their feet again in the homeland".   

801206
The 1990 World Cup has begun with a highly palatable variety of dishes but this evening's game in the Sant'Elia Stadium belongs to a different menu. 
Cameroon may have stirred the pot, Romania added some Byzantine sauce and Italy produced a delicious antipasta but in Cagliari it will be back to the boiled beef of the English First Division. 
In a way the match <tag "537563">promises</> to be a microcosm of English football's position compared to the rest of a world which has already wondered at the precocious skills of Cameroon, the dash of Lacatus and the art of Donadoni.   

801207
Other charities responded with bids to bolster public confidence. 
CHILDREN with special needs were today <tag "537527">promised</> that they will not be pushed beyond their ability by radical changes in education.

The first half was characterised by Bridgend pressing forward, threatening to score, yet making a crucial mistake at exactly the wrong time. 
Not that Pontypridd were grateful for every little grace and favour.

They undertook to secure the range of human rights, from freedom of conscience to a fair wage, not just for their own citizens but also for those in other countries. 
Despite these <tag "537566">promises</>, in 1988 alone 76 countries jailed people solely for the peaceful exercise of their human rights.

Many Russian exiles have long suspected that spies had been planted in their midst by the KGB, and for some the advertisements confirmed their darkest fears. 
The FBI &dash. which handles counterintelligence matters &dash. is trying to turn the influx of Soviet emigres to its advantage, however, and, according to The New York Times, the agency hopes to reap a potential intelligence bonanza once double agents have been weeded out. 
The agency's unorthodox approach and a solemn <tag "537566">promise</> that `replies will be kept in the strictest confidence" caused some mirth among exiles.   

801214
Simultaneously, sustained progress is being made in Vienna towards a treaty on conventional forces in Europe: therefore, 1990 could signal an era where Western Europe would no longer face an unacceptably large array of Soviet military might. 
Parity of conventional forces would become a reality instead of a <tag "537566">promise</>, with a buffer of erstwhile Soviet allies separating Russia from Western Europe.  

801215
BNL's chairman resigned after it was revealed that the bank's Atlanta branch gave almost #1m in unauthorised loans to firms supplying Baghdad with arms and supplies.

801216
He believed that, by its means, we could arrive at certainty on such matters. 
But, besides the fact that the details of his method cannot be read into many of the advances made in the sciences, his <tag "537527">promise</> of certainty has come to seem inappropriate.   

801217
Mr Torok is passionate about the work of turn-of-the-century painter Tivadar Csontvary Kosztka and more or less devotes the National Gallery entry to him. 
The Csontvary figures we find there yearn intensely in their canvases, while their saturated colours anticipate abstraction. 
Perhaps it is their potency, their sense of expectancy, that is so thoroughly Hungarian; the character of a country rich with <tag "537626">promise</>, with an underworld in tow.   

801218
Registrars, the lowest level of judge, are given some form of judicial title and increased powers of adjudication. 
Lord Mackay has <tag "537527">promised</> that `the High Court will be reserved for judicial review and other specialist cases and for general cases of unusual substance, importance or difficulty".  

801219
There are, therefore, three kinds of consent that do not impose obligations on the agent: first, where his personal situation is not affected by the consent; second, where his personal situation is favourably affected, for the consent is a condition of his possession of a right or of some other benefit; third, where his personal situation is adversely affected, but by waiving a right rather than by undertaking an obligation. 
It is worth noting, however, that consent to a political authority entails a <tag "537566">promise</> to obey it (as well as perhaps an obligation to support it in other ways).   

801220
He asked Ashton, who was an old friend and had just created Illuminations for the company, to suggest who would be most suitable.

A presumed member of Hizbollah, Ali Mohamed Hariri, is in prison in Switzerland for the murder of a Frenchman on board an Air Afrique airliner during a hijack attempt which ended in Geneva in July 1987 &dash. and Hariri's release is said here to have been part of the price which the Swiss government secretly agreed to pay for the release of Peter Winkler, the Red Cross official who was freed in Sidon 10 months ago. 
Several Red Cross officials believed that the Swiss government had foolishly offered to trade Hariri for Mr Winkler and had then reneged on its <tag "537566">promise</>.

Is it still labour policy that {vocal sound="um"} sixth forms should be abolished and replaced by tertiary colleges? 
It's &ellip. the last manifesto, which went out in eighty seven, included a <tag "537566">promise</> to {vocal sound="um"} develop tertiary education wherever it was appropriate locally.   

801228
The latest items to qualify are some fax machines ordered by the Air Force which are going to cost at least dollars 76,000 ( #48,000) each. 
In defence of this stratospheric amount, an Air Force spokesman replied defensively that `It is not your ordinary fax machine" and <tag "537527">promises</> it will function in the desert, the Arctic or anywhere else that Uncle Sam deems to be a battlefield.   

801229
As expected, MPs yesterday approved the budget for next year, thus averting the immediate prospect of insolvency. 
But if the IMF decides that the cuts <tag "537527">promised</> in the budget are too small, Hungary could find itself under severe pressure with no means to respond.   

801230
But some senior members of Congress in both parties remain concerned by recent developments in US budget politics. 
They believe the Bush administration's <tag "537566">promise</> of steady deficit erosion, in co-operation with Congress, is being more systematically derailed.

You know, it's fashionable to run down the British economy . . ." 
For almost five minutes he then tells us, with mounting excitement, that dozens of foreign companies are now investing in Britain because of the brilliant record of the Conservative government. 
He concludes with an invitation to `write to me, Kenneth Baker, at 32 Smith Square" if we want to know more about his enticing <tag "537566">promises</>.

The title was changed earlier this week to enable MPs opposed to abortion to bring in an amendment which would limit termination of pregnancy to 18 weeks after conception. 
Life, the anti-abortion organisation, <tag "537527">promised</> to beseige Parliament with the largest number of petitions in its history. 

801236
The go-ahead has already been given to build privately run remand centres. 
Home Office officials from Britain went to West Palm Beach to see how electronic tagging systems are working there before introducing a trial run for people on probation in Nottingham later this year. 
If the Nottingham test proves as successful as the system seems to have worked in Florida, it could mean even better business for Marconi in Swindon who <tag "537527">promise</> more jobs.   

801237
Before the Palm Springs meeting, trade talks between Japan and America were going nowhere. 
An evidently shaken Mr Kaifu returned from Palm Springs convinced that trade relations were not a problem but a crisis. 
This time, Mr Kaifu was convinced, the Americans would not be shut up with a <tag "537566">promise</> here, a concession there.   

801238
Sometimes Sheila got away from her family to come with her and she drove down for a few hours as well as now and again in the middle of the week. 
The air fare from London was too expensive for Maggie to come regularly. 
Michael, their younger brother, had <tag "537527">promised</> to come from London at Easter but Luke, the eldest, still would not come.   

801239
A wave of anger at the corruption and conceit of the ruling Congress (I) party has swept the dishevelled forces of the opposition into an improbable alliance that threatens to ruin the 45-year-old Prime Minister. 
For the more than 300 million people likely to vote on three separate days of polling this week, the crucial issues seem to revolve around twin questions of trust. 
Can Mr Gandhi be trusted to keep his alluring new <tag "538409">promises</> when for much of the last two years his regime has been wallowing in lies and deceit?   

801240
Its front man once again is Tony Slattery, whom the producers describe, not altogether flatteringly in my opinion, as `an auspicious contender to Barry Norman". 
The programme is networked (transmission times vary across the regions) and is aimed fairly squarely at the late-night, couch potato and pub spill-over crowd. 
It does not look to be breaking much new ground: the preview trailer included items on the massively under-hyped Batman, scoop interviews with Jane Fonda and Gregory Peck, both on the promo trail for their new film The Old Gringo, and a <tag "537625">promised</> itemette on newcomer Kylie Minogue.   

801241
Any such agreement would have covered much more than simply the federal Parliament and federal courts explicitly provided for in the Constitution Act, 1867; for example, Orders-in-Council. 
Is there one word of evidence that this was ever <tag "537527">promised</> by anyone, let along agreed on?

Further cuts in the PSO, though part of long-term government policy, are nevertheless bound to prove controversial against the background of heavy extra spending on safety. 
Cecil Parkinson, Secretary of State for Transport, <tag "537527">promised</> earlier this month that money would be no obstacle to the new safety measures after Clapham.   

801249
Organizational learning, rather than a working application, is often the primary justification for a pilot project, and so costs of the learning should be shared across the organization as a whole. 
The central staff can further accelerate learning and technological diffusion by participating in the careful assessment of each pilot project &dash. its costs, benefits, and problems of introducing it. 
Central support should be limited to a few of the most <tag "537614">promising</> technologies rather than spread across a broad front. 

801250
A reception for 90 guests was held at Woodstock Youth Club. 
A FULL inquiry was <tag "537527">promised</> today into a gas leak at a nuclear power station which prompted the evacuation of 250 workers.

However, among other things, we are celebrating the imminent return to East Germany of free, national elections. 
It is not implausible that in such elections a government might be elected which <tag "537527">promised</> speedy reunification, regardless of what the rest of Europe thinks, and that in free, national elections in West Germany a government might be elected which promised the same.

He offers the unassailable proposition that without money there can be no inflation. 
President Collor's plan combines free marketeering and authoritarian intervention in a bewildering but roughly equal mix.

Bull, who has played only one Second Division match since suspension and flu, looked out of his depth despite Lineker's unselfish running.

801263
In this scholarly and absorbing book, Colin Chambers describes its birth, the heroic optimism of the late 1930's, and the years of Cold War decline which made the fire seem almost a blessing. 
SOME HISTORIANS have all the luck. 
When Dennis Bark and David Gress set out, five years ago, to write their history of West Germany from 1945 to the present, they cannot have known that its publication would coincide with the beginning of what <tag "537563">promises</> to be the only successful revolution from below in German history.

Such dependence was not a problem when fertilizers were cheap in the 1950s  and 1960s, but since the oil crisis in the 1970s, their cost has rocketed. 
Fertilizers remain an attractive option for many farmers, but, because of finite fossil  fuel reserves and the political instability of countries from which phosphate is  obtained, the prices <tag "537563">promise</> to rise still further.

Namely, it is the interest to have voluntary special bonds with other people. 
We should remind ourselves that while the promisee may not be the initiator of the bond of which the promise is the whole or a part, he is not entirely passive either. 
It is always up to him to waive his right under the <tag "537527">promise</> and thus terminate the binding force of the promise.

Full details of what <tag "537563">promise</> to be uplifting and enjoyable celebrations are carried on page 4 and the back cover.  

801284
But it is interesting to relate this issue to the question of the promisee's right created by the promise. 
One view regards the promisee's right under any particular promise as a core right based on his interest in the promised act (and the intention of the promisor to be obligated to perform the act). 
On this view, if there could be binding <tag "537566">promises</> which do not benefit the promisee (and are not intended to do so) then there are promises which do not create rights in the promisee. 

801285
Obviously tired in the Windhoek heat, the Welsh were staggered by the late rally and did not look capable of responding. 
Gradually the lead was whittled down to a mere four points as the try-scoring of Swarz and the accuracy of Jaco Coetzee with the boot had the Welsh management checking their watches. 
Once again, frustratingly, the Welsh after such a <tag "537614">promising</> start had lost their way, but it will do no harm to the eight newly capped players to have been part of such a tense clash.

But if film executives were to be believed, the majority of the audience was less interested in salving their fears about wars and conflicts ahead than in looking back to the time when Britain had a role to play in the world. 
Like the crooks pursued by the hero in Calling Bulldog Drummond (1951), for whom `life in peacetime seemed unbearably flat", or the ex-officers who take over their old ship for smuggling runs across the Channel in the Ship that Died of Shame (1955), or The League of Gentlemen (1960), for whom robbing a bank <tag "537563?">promises</> their `finest hour", many filmmakers seemed to feel that there was nothing to do, now the war was over and the hopes of peace had faded, than go back to the site of old glories.

It might have been the pavilion of any village cricket club in England, with a ragged lawn and parched rose beds arranged around a ridiculous stone bird-bath in the moonlit middle distance. 
Ruben <tag "537527">promised</> to find iced water and returned soon with a waiter carrying a tinkling pitcher and three glasses. 

801292
Take, for instance, the recent experience of three conservative Republicans. 
The day after the July ruling in the Supreme Court, Bob Martinez, Governor of Florida, <tag "537527">promised</> a special session of the state legislature to push through abortion-restricting laws.   

801293
The electricity supply industry will be privatised, as promised. 
The manifesto went on to pledge that the Government would `proceed with the next phase of our nuclear programme", in order to ensure that Britain continued to play `a leading role in the task of developing abundant low-cost supplies of nuclear electricity". 
That <tag "537566">promise</> looked hollow in the eyes of those Tory backbenchers who witnessed Mr Wakeham's despatch box retraction yesterday.   

801294
Asquith sold the pass, perhaps without meaning to do so. 
He <tag "537527">promised</> that no attested married men should be called up until all unmarried men had been taken.   

801295
There's only one item on the agenda: to get rid of me." 
And such now promises to be the immediate outcome of an affair which justifiably has become a cause celebre. 
More perfectly than any other, it illustrates the limit of press freedom in today's Soviet Union, as perestroika's <tag "537566">promises</> collide with the reality of a country in crisis.   

801296
But the sting in this season's tale is that only Wasps among the leading flight of four at the head of the table have the bottom two sides still to play in their remaining half a dozen matches. 
Wasps, missing David Pegler and with Jeff Probyn and Gary Holmes at prop, begin their push this afternoon in what <tag "537563">promises</> to be a home pushover against ailing Moseley, hampered by the long-term absence of Simon Robson, their England B scrum-half who crushed his hand in a midweek weight-training accident.   

801297
East Berlin political leaders rejected the recommendation. 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl was accused of betraying his election <tag "537566">promises</>, though he insisted that the only commitment he had given of a one-to-one exchange rate was to small savers, and that there were no grounds for anxiety.   

801298
Joyce and Rourke were just happy to have found a dream lifestyle though they occasionally questioned why their pockets were still empty. 
Johnny Marr simply clutched his twelve-string Rickenbacker (Which once belonged to one of his heroes, Roger McGuinn from The Byrds) and concentrated on the meagre task of fulfilling the <tag "537626">promise</> held by one of the most eagerly awaited de&acute.but albums in history.

What happened when you left Hatton and Pertwee at the bridge?" 
Stamford had <tag "537527">promised</> to give Burden all the help they could and they were as good as their word.   

801301
This is untrue. 
In January 1985, the Vietnamese offered to withdraw their troops from Cambodia in return for no more than a <tag "537566">promise</> that the Khmer Rouge would be excluded from the `coalition" which occupies Cambodia's seat at the UN and which was invented by America and China as a cover for the Khmer Rouge.   

801302
The rudder trim started at two thirds to the right and in level flight, with the power set at 24", manifold 2200 rpm, ended up a quarter to the left. 
The distance to fly was just over 500 nautical miles, which meant that with the published 75% cruise range of 780 nautical miles with reserves, we had more than two hours excess endurance. 
The route <tag "537563">promised</> to throw a variety of weather at us. 

801303
Whether this was an attempt to convince himself, or whether Heinemann really meant it, we shall never know. 
The publishers not only accepted Spirits in Prison for publication; they also assured Lewis that John Galsworthy, the novelist and author of The Forsyte Saga, would give it some publicity in his magazine Reveille, in which a selection of work by contemporary poets was <tag "537527">promised</>.  

801304
Nevertheless Zum has continued to gain support, mainly because it gives the government's growing number of critics a chance to demonstrate their opposition to Mr Mugabe, who has ruled the country since independence in 1980. 
ALL President FW de Klerk's talk of `a new South Africa", the expectation generated by the release of Walter Sisulu and the other political prisoners, the excitement about sanctions and negotiations and reform just pass by most black South Africans. 
Ground down by ignorance and poverty, they may some day come to appreciate the effects of the <tag "537625">promised</> change, but the causes will have eluded them.   

801305
RED FACES and a subsequent drop in credibility surrounded the visit of the Soviet team when they landed in London last night for the start of a five-match tour, which takes them from Cornwall to Cumbria. 
Prisma, the London-based sports management consultants who held weekend discussions with leading England players about potential earnings &dash. up to #70,000 a year was the figure mentioned once amateur regulations are relaxed &dash. have been baled out by the Rugby Football Union after <tag "537566">promises</> of financial support for the trip failed to materialise.   

801306
The US parent then hiked turnover at one of the subsidiaries from #6.7 million to #24.2 million in only six years. 
The fate of Smith &and. McLaurin, together with the #2.2 million investment which secured it, is surely a <tag "537566">promise</> of good things to come.   

801307
These writers and many fans were demanding a return to what they saw to be something purer and Lu Watters set out to provide it. 
In fact Watters had been playing jazz as a teenager during the so-called Golden Era of the Twenties. 
Lu began his career as `the most <tag "537614">promising</> bugler" at the St Joseph's Military Academy in Sacramento and as trumpeter in the school's brass band.

The $30-a-tonne levy paid by producers on their exports and by consumers on imports from non-member countries will be abolished from April 15. 
Producers, who owe the organisation nearly $140m in levy arrears, have <tag "537527">promised</> to attempt to repay some of the debt.   

801309
The crowd burst into thunderous applause when one activist, a doctor named Frank Tellkamp, declared that no system could survive if it failed to respect people's needs. 
Dresden's party leader, Hans Modrow, told the crowd the party knew it must make great efforts to regain the trust of the people and must follow up <tag "537566">promises</> of reform with deeds.

Raucous but radical. 
The Beautiful South squad had got off to a shaky start, with a shoddy sound balance, and hints of fitness problems.

Even though numbers have only swelled to around 2,000 a year, we are the highest foreign currency earner thanks to the system of pre-charging each group member between dollars 120 and dollars 250 (around #77-#162) a day, depending on the season and the number of festivals on the programme. 
We had none to look forward to, since the one <tag "537527">promised</> had been held four months early to mark the king's wedding.

Paul Parker, who must be wondering why he is not classed among the top 43 in the land, unfurled one lyrical straight drive before falling leg before to a fiendish Foster grubber. 
Alan Wells then <tag "537527">promised</> similar fine fare until he was visibly flabbergasted to be adjudged caught behind.

Pressed Steel had to wait until the last game for their second win of the season beating House-Martins 4-2 thanks to 11 doll Brian Watson. 
Gladiators and Berinsfield clashed in the last game of the season, two sides who <tag "537563">promised</> so much yet failed to find any consistency.

But I'll be off to Stamford in the morning to have a scent round.

Mr Hubbard, aged 59, of Chiswick Mall, west London, spent #250,000 restoring the car, and is suing Middlebridge Scimitar Ltd over its alleged breach of a 1990 agreement to buy the car for #10 million. 
Middlebridge is counter-claiming damages for alleged misrepresentation and breach of contract; it accepts the car is the one which crashed at Brooklands in 1932, but says it is not the one <tag "537527">promised</>, the Le Mans winner of 1929 and 1930, and is completely rebuilt.

The whole lot must be swept away." 
CONFERENCE delegates yesterday swept aside a warning from the party leadership and called for the next Labour government to take back into public ownership immediately land sold off by privatised water companies. 
The party is committed to renationalising the water industry, but Syd Tierney, on behalf of the National Executive Committee, said it could not <tag "537527">promise</> to buy back, `acre by acre", any land which is sold.   

801319
It may have been wrong to promise to give my son fireworks, for they are too dangerous. 
But having made the promise it may now be my duty to give him the fireworks. 
Of course if the danger is grave I should break my <tag "538410">promise</> and seek to compensate him in some other way.   

801320
But he appears to have realised that he had no immediate future in domestic politics. 
He became increasingly critical of Government policies, and when the Prime Minister asked him to become an EC commissioner it was not clear whether she was fulfilling her <tag "537566">promise</> or trying to remove him from the scene.   

801321
Every string will be pulled among former members, both in and out of the army, and each unit will make extravagant claims about its own strengths and others' weaknesses, and about the low motives which have hitherto protected the latter. 
Why not abolish the Gurkhas (`they can't handle sophisticated kit &dash. the trouble is we've <tag "537527">promised</> the King of Nepal we'll keep them"), or put the Household Cavalry (`a bunch of amateurs") out to grass, or scrap a few of the 40 remaining frigates and destroyers (`sitting ducks, but the Navy loves holding cocktail parties on the afterdeck, submarines aren't much good for that, women hate going up and down the ladders"), or do anything but kill the Loamshires.   

801322
Politically, Mr Santos is harder to attack &dash. he prides himself on understanding nothing of politics or economics and having no manifesto. 
`I have an inner force: call it mystical, esoteric, theological, whatever you like," he said, <tag "537527">promising</> that once elected he would surround himself with `well-intentioned men" to solve all the nation's problems.

`By handing over my notes under seal I would put my source at risk in the event that my appeal was unsuccessful.

How seriously the 14 members of the investigation commission will approach their task remains to be seen, they themselves being products of the system. 
Meanwhile, Mr Modrow, who <tag "537527">promised</> that honesty, modesty and competence would be among the guidelines of his new government, has been setting an entirely new personal style.   

801325
In England Rosalind Belben's Is Beauty Good (Serpent's Tail #6.95) and Roger Moss's The Miraculous Birth, Secret Life and Lamentable Death of Mr Chinn (Peter Halban #9.95), as well as the posthumous appearance of Thomas Bernhard's Old Masters (Quartet #11.95). 
In France too a fine novelist spoke to us from beyond the grave, when Georges Perec's unfinished last novel, 53 Jours (Pol #14.90) was published, along with many of his working notes, in an edition by Harry Matthews and Jacques Roubaud. 
Roubaud himself finally produced the book that his great and varied talent had always <tag "537527">promised</>, Le Grand Incendie de Londres (Seuil #13.95), a beautifully controlled examination of the effect on him of his wife's death and of the failure of his literary ambitions.   

801326
Harwell departments have also been asked to turn out surplus or out-of-date text books, reports, dictionaries and other useful literature. 
SINCE there are literally millions of fans of Coronation Street, a book that promises `the inside story" of the thrice-weekly soap opera will doubtless sell well. 
It's just a pity that Bill Podmore's Coronation Street (Macdonald, #9.95) isn't the book it <tag "537563">promises</> to be.   

801327
The same confusion can arise outside the law. 
Many people believe that promises of young children regarding the medium or long-term future are not binding. 
It is wrong to identify this with a prohibition on making or receiving such <tag "538411">promises</>.   

801328
Fourteen of the 27 people injured were in Waverney Hospital in Ballymena today. 
None, except the two young boys, was serious and a hospital spokesman said it was expected several would be discharged later today. 
British Rail today <tag "537527">promised</> a thorough investigation into a train crash in which seven people were injured, one seriously.

Rarely, however, have these two benefits been so effectively  combined as in the new DOUBLE PAYOUT PLAN from Reader's Digest. 
Traditionally, life insurance policies have been geared to either  protection or investment, rarely to both. 
But DOUBLE PAYMENT, specially developed for Reader's Digest by  Guardian Royal Exchange, <tag "537527">promises</> you full-cover life insurance  and a generous cash sum &dash. either on your 65th birthday or  after ten years, whichever is later.

By the summer of 1944 reverses on the Eastern Front had fostered growing doubts within the SS regarding Germany's Ost policy. 
Finally Himmler himself summoned Vlasov, and <tag "537527">promised</> his aid in the creation of a liberation army.

Of course the Act didn't give the Quebec nationalists all they wanted. 
But Trudeau never <tag "537527">promised</> it would.   

801335
But neither the power nor the obligation point to a right to promise. 
The right exists because the very same interest on which the power to promise and the duty to keep promises are based is also the ground for holding others to be subject to a duty not to interfere with one's promising. 
The duty requires one not to prevent a person from <tag "537527">promising</> (e.g. by denying him the means of communicating an intention to undertake by that very communication an obligation, or by stopping others from receiving such communications).

Ravenscraig had worse productivity than BS strip mills at Llanwern and Port Talbot, he said. 
Sir Robert appeared to rule out any deal to save the Ravenscraig strip mill, pointing out that BS had never promised to consider private bids for it. 
He fuelled speculation that BS would ultimately close the entire Ravenscraig works by reminding Mr Rifkind of British Steel's <tag "537566">promise</> that `if it should consider at some stage, because of market conditions, to close its steelmaking facilities in Ravenscraig it would consider on a commercial basis any wholly-owned private sector offer &ellip. as an alternative to closure".

While the toddler prefers to tug the beard and poke a wet finger into my eye, four-year-old boys are generally serious, with a tendency to request ludicrously expensive presents. 
Without the faintest regard for the parent cringing in the background, they will demand a data-base programmed computer, a compact disc player or a mountain bike. 
Yet there are others in this age group who really believe you've trekked all the way from the North Pole, and have painstakingly prepared letters for you and will <tag "537527">promise</> to leave out some mince pies for Rudolph.

Labour practised this policy resolutely in regard to India.

So much of our aid is given with strings. 
(Take our aid, but you must <tag "537527">promise</> to buy our goods and especially weapons.) 

801342
There was only a thin trickle of transfers from secondary modern to grammar schools at the age of thirteen, but even this simply exaggerated the class differentials, giving an added advantage to the children of middle-class parents. 
It was clear that the honest <tag "537566">promises</> of 1944 had not been fulfilled: the secondary moderns had not secured parity of esteem, and never would.   

801343
Baldwin was right. 
Hugh Dalton, the most strenuous of Labour politicians for resistance to Germany, said on 26 March: `Public opinion in this country would not support, and certainly the Labour party would not support, the taking of military sanctions or even of economic sanctions against Germany at this time." 
The British government could only offer France and Belgium a renewed guarantee against German aggression, thus escaping from a <tag "537566">promise</> now by giving a less effective one for the future.  

801344
The government says the rebels have suffered heavy losses, however, and claims they are on the brink of defeat. 
More than 70,000 people &dash. most of them civilians killed by the military &dash. have died in the Salvadorean war since it began in 1979. 
WITH THE barbarities of a decade-long military dictatorship behind them, Uruguayans emerged this week into full democracy for the first time in 18 years, electing a president who <tag "537527">promised</> to do nothing to upset their much-prized status quo.

The first hope of a breakthrough in the saga emerged during a meeting between Mr Shevardnadze and Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the West German Foreign Minister, at the United Nations. 
The Soviet minister was `shattered" by Mr Genscher's account of the nightmare conditions in which the refugees were living in Prague and <tag "537527">promised</> to do all he could to help.   

801347
Then &dash. and this was the novelty &dash. there were calls for German unity on West German terms. 
A speaker introducing himself as a `plain craftsman" said they had been lied to and betrayed for 40 years; that the <tag "537625">promised</> `new socialism" would not work either; that everyone could see that a free market economy does work; and that `we cannot repress the will to German unity".   

801348
To bring about a change it is necessary to demonstrate, by example, that the social and technological demands of this society can be accommodated within buildings designed more in harmony with traditional urban and rural landscapes, that modern technology and architectural tradition can be reconciled and that the past is, if not a pattern book to be slavishly copied, a source to be creatively plundered. 
From a modern marriage of technology and history a late twentieth-century architecture could yet emerge that would once again satisfy both layman and architect. 
A YEAR ago BBC 1 relaunched its Nine O'Clock News with a hi-tech logo, a portentous signature tune and a <tag "537566">promise</> to get back to basics with a single newsreader backed by specialists.

Not all, however, feel embarrassed about their racism.

In a terse report, the Romanian news agency said the two countries had talks on `bilateral issues and the need for good neighbourly relations". 
The official statement issued at the end of the summit said the seven Pact members had the right `to make their own political line, strategy or tactics without outside interference". 
On East-West relations, the official communique acknowledged that the prospects for arms control agreements with Nato were <tag "537614">promising</>, but it criticised the West's adherence to deterrent theory and its plans to modernise its short-range nuclear missiles. 

801354
Hongkong Bank bought a 14.9% stake in Midland, paying #4.75 a share (Midland's shares price is now #3.43).

James Sharp, 48, a doctor who charged patients #700 for an experimental Aids treatment which he <tag "537527">promised</> could enable them to live indefinitely, was ordered to be struck off after being found guilty of serious professional misconduct.

`I enjoy the power of influence &dash. it is the manifestation of the fact that you are doing something useful, I need that to survive," he says. 
SIR JAMES GOLDSMITH's long battle for control of BAT Industries suffered another unexpected setback over the weekend when the chairman of Axa Midi, the French insurance company that has <tag "537527">promised</> to buy BAT's Farmers Insurance group if the bid is successful, was admitted to hospital suddenly for heart surgery.   

801359
The interest on which it is based validates the promising principle, namely: If a person communicates an intention to undertake by that very act of communication a certain obligation then he has that obligation. 
The promising principle establishes that if we promise we are obligated to act as we promised. 
It also establishes a present obligation to keep our <tag "538409">promises</>, i.e. we are obligated to perform action X, if we promised to perform X. This is a conditional obligation.

But some senior members of Congress in both parties remain concerned by recent developments in US budget politics. 
They believe the Bush administration's promise of steady deficit erosion, in co-operation with Congress, is being more systematically derailed. 
Democratic leaders in Congress have been wounded and baffled by the fight picked by President Bush over his <tag "537625">promised</> cut in capital gains taxes.

Only firm support from the United States might make the Japanese hesitate, and the Americans were hard to draw.

According to Simmons, consenting differs from promising in two ways: `First, consent in the strict sense is always given to the actions of other persons. 
Thus, I may consent to my daughter's marriage, to be governed by the decisions of the majority, or to my friend's handling my financial affairs. 
<tag "537566">Promises</>, on the other hand, cannot, except in very special circumstances, ever be made concerning the actions of another person. 

801369
Violation of the duty not to interfere with a person's promising will frustrate his right to promise and the interest on which it is base, either by preventing the person from exercising his rights or by perverting the considerations on which he decides whether to promise or not. 
The fact that such interferences with the right are infrequent is reflected by the fact that the right to promise is rarely invoked in ordinary practical discourse. 
To conclude, the power to <tag "537527">promise</> and the right to promise are distinct notions.   

801370
I am sure that I speak for the entire female workforce when I venture that the men with whom we share our professional lives do not seem to work on this principle. 
They will carry out the <tag "537625">promised</> undertaking, attend the arranged meeting or return the phone call so long as nothing better comes up in the interim.

British Rail had <tag "537527">promised</> that if a new station were built in Kidlington, services to and from Banbury would stop there, giving the village a train every two hours.   

801374
The separateness of persons is not merely a limitation on the extent to which compliance with such obligations can be imposed on one from the outside, it is not merely a reflection of the moral relevance of coercion. 
Another <tag "537566">promise</> held by Williams is the rejection of the view of separability of persons as a device to lighten the moral burden, to allow one an escape from moral rigorism. 

801375
Finally, he turned to historical theology, and entered New College, Oxford, completing a doctorate at the age of 75. 
Until his mobility became impaired his commanding figure was regularly to be seen at the Russian Orthodox Cathedral in Ennismore Gardens, where it was his delight to exercise his fine bass voice in their choir. 
His mind remained aggressively clear to the end and his last project was full of <tag "537626">promise</>: an autobiography.   

801376
The Platters revived the style of the Ink Spots of the Forties and the Coasters (originally Robins) were their nearest rivals. 
The emphasis of the hit songs was on true love as can only be experienced before the age of twenty, on the right side of the generation gap. 
The Coasters sang of `Young Blood", the Everly Brothers sang `Bye Bye Love" and `All I Have To Do is Dream", Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers asked `Why Do Fools Fall In Love?", Dion and the Belmonts expounded on `A Teenager In Love", Tab Hunter suffered from `Young Love", the baby-voiced Buddy Holly and the Crickets <tag "537527">promised</> `That'll Be The Day" and, most explicitly of all, Nat King Cole plaintively rebuked the middle-aged in the song `Too Young':   

801377
The MIS, with its vast network of informers, was designed by General Ne Win to consolidate his hold on power. 
Diplomats think that by releasing General Tin Oo now, General Ne Win may be trying to counter the growing power of the MIS head, Khin Nyunt. 
The military government, officially called the State Law and Order Restoration Committee, has <tag "537527">promised</> to hold elections by May.   

801378
Many farmers on the Levels are trapped, if they stop to think  about it, by their low-input agriculture, which allows them no capital to escape from the parish in which they were born. 
It is fortunate for the environment and for the rest of us that generations of stock farmers and withy-growers have generally been content with their excellent cider, their close-knit community,  and the level green horizons which contain their world. 
How many environmentalists, as they drive back up the motorway, having admired the birdlife of the Levels through a brand-new pair of binoculars, pause to consider that they are really having their cake and eating it too, as they enjoy a top-quality  environment which may be preserved only because the quality of the lives of its inhabitants holds out little <tag "537573">promise</> of advancement. 

801379
The British, again spurred by the Dominions, also relinquished their alliance with Japan. 
As an alternative security for Japan, the British and the Americans <tag "537527">promised</> not to develop their naval bases at Hong Kong and in the Philippines.   

801380
`No gun will be raised in Lebanon except the legitimate gun &ellip. we call for a life of dignity instead of mass suicide," he told the parliament.

But Mr Fitzwater did confirm that US officials had spoken directly to her husband, something previously denied. 
US officials say privately that Washington <tag "537527">promised</> the rebels that American troops would block two key roads leading to the headquarters of the Panamanian Defence Forces (PDF). 

801382
The economic measures proposed by Mr Bush and welcomed by Mr Gorbachev will do nothing in the short run to stock Soviet shelves this coming miserable winter. 
Nevertheless, most-favoured-nation treatment and the first step towards eventual membership of Gatt are important to Mr Gorbachev as signs that his ambition to make the Soviet union `a part of the world economic system" holds <tag "537626">promise</>.

At the time of his death he was looking forward to seeing his eldest son, Abul Faiz, who was working in a restaurant in Swansea and who planned to come to London to see his father later in the week. 
Like many of his fellow migrants, Abdus Sattar may have discovered not a land of opportunity but another land described by an anonymous Somali poet, of broken <tag "538410">promises</>, broken hearts and hopes overthrown.   

801384
Not only is Marxist ideology apparently exhausted. 
Young people in the West are increasingly seeing through consumerist ideologies and asking for something more <tag "537614">promising</>. 

801385
A `host" network &dash. like the BBC or Independent Television &dash. cannot be found to commit both resources and slots in its programming schedules 18 months before the event. 
But both major networks have <tag "537527">promised</> substantial coverage -Sheffield will hope for at least one daily 50-minute programme of highlights on BBC &dash. and is in negotiation with satellite broadcasters.

PRICES for Old Master paintings were going through the roof again at Christie's yesterday. 
Heading the field was a Rubens landscape at #3.3m, an auction record for the artist, but much in line with Christie's hopes. 
Although A Forest at Dawn with a Deer Hunt is very dark, cleaning <tag "537563">promises</> to bring out more depth, according to Christie's.  

801389
Nicholas Winterton, the Tory MP for Macclesfield, last night tabled a Commons amendment to block any pay increases for ministers until the plight of the war widows is debated. 
THE CZECHOSLOVAK Prime Minister, Ladislav Adamec, bargained yesterday with the opposition over bringing more non-Communists into the government, and <tag "537527">promised</> to resign if a new cabinet he is to announce tomorrow failed to win the people's confidence.   

801390
Flesh folds to die for, convex cake-holes for budding Bardots &dash. male and female &dash. to puff and point in hot surrender or childish defiance. 
The bread and butter of pin-up prominence, the slobber-chops of gender blur, preaching petulance to the hungry masses. 
Sensual love-blimps, billowing out like hillocky, hummocky, water bottles of desire, bulging with hidden <tag "537626">promise</> and a hint of, hmm, ignorance. 

801391
Still under discussion is whether the declaration should be open to all European countries or should be limited to the 23 Nato and Warsaw Pact countries. 
But it is quite certain that the Nato declaration will avoid language that perpetuates the Warsaw Pact as an institution. 
IN a radical departure from previous government statements, the Prime Minister, Petre Roman, announced his new government yesterday with the <tag "537566">promise</> of quick privatisation and an attack on the existing state bureaucracy.

Perhaps McGeechan should call for a few AN O'Thers. 
LOU MACARI began his duties yesterday with a <tag "537566">promise</> to inject iron into West Ham's play and a warning that the club's unsettled players must honour their contracts.

Detainees who protested were kept in cachots, small underground punishment cells. 
In April this year, after guards took away their clothing, medicines and books, they went on a hunger strike which ended 21 days later when the prison authorities promised reforms. 
The <tag "538409">promises</> were not kept and in June they went back on hunger strike. 

801395
Brown reached the final at Bristol, Castle won Manchester and Nick Fulwood made the third round at Wimbledon. 
Of them all, Bailey has shown most <tag "537626">promise</>.

A spirited third set revival from Australian qualifier Wally Masur forced Becker into another third set tie-break which he edged 8-6 to win finally 6-7, 6-4, 7-6. 
THE rebel English tour of South Africa, which has outraged anti-apartheid groups, may be postponed or even cancelled, a leading opposition newspaper in the Republic reported yesterday. 
The Weekly Mail in Johannesburg said the tour, scheduled to start in January, was out of place in the current political atmosphere, with new President F W de Klerk introducing or <tag "537527">promising</> a series of reforms.

After studying painting in the Academie Julienne in Paris, Maclaren went up to Cambridge in 1922, gaining a blue as a boxer. 
The Morning Post reported of an Oxford and Cambridge boxing match in March 1924: `Maclaren took heavy punishment without flinching, Egan (his opponent), naturally got the verdict, but the Cambridge man must be said to have shown excellent promise for a comparative novice." 
<tag "537626">Promise</> he did show, spending the next six decades exploring and mastering such disciplines as painting, designing furniture, photography and poetry. 

801400
`He's going to have to hold down tremendous expectations, and it won't be long before people ask `What's democracy doing for me?" 
' Mindful of the business leaders and the generals, Mr Aylwin has repeatedly promised to build on the past, `maintaining an open and competitive economy with clear rules and stability". 
Remembering the economic morass that followed the return to democracy in Brazil, Peru and Argentina, Mr Aylwin <tag "537527">promises</> to preserve Pinochet policies he says resemble those of socialist Spain.   

801401
`Clearly there is a need for industry to stop the proliferation of `green" symbols and develop standard European symbols," the survey said. 
The Green Bill <tag "537527">promised</> by the Government for the autumn is not expected to include measures to ban undesirable products or make them more expensive.

I was horrified to discover that Mrs Arkwright of Railway Buildings owes sixpence for groceries. 
I made father <tag "537527">promise</> that he would never extend credit again.   

801403
College staff have issued a health warning: `because the issues raised during courses are of great importance and can seldom be separated from questions of personal transformation, students must expect to find the work emotionally as well as intellectually demanding." 
They <tag "537527">promise</> they will not teach `any particular reassuring system of belief, nor is it a therapeutic or counselling centre."   

801404
At the appointed time we take our position behind the Arc de Triomphe in an atmosphere of keen excitement. 
Just as we round the Arc to start the performance, contrary to all <tag "537527-x">promises</> the whole width of the avenue is awash with water.

`Based on what's happening, we're certainly sceptical," he said. 
`We remain to be convinced and we would like to see the ceasefire discussions be continued and we'd like to see some more evidence of a free and fair election process." 
He said the US was pleased, however, by Mr Ortega's <tag "537566">promise</> to stop arming guerrillas in El Salvador.   

801406
Hard headed reasons underpin the promotion of Japanese. 
Far East capital is flowing in partly because oriental employers recognise a skilled work force when they see one, partly because of Mr Walker's indefatigable salesmanship and partly because of the need Japanese companies feel to establish a European base in advance of the <tag "537625">promised</> bonanza of 1992.   

801407
He kept saying he did not like the title of anti-hero, but it wouldn't go away. 
Anti-heroes were in vogue and they were appearing in varying degrees of regression from the romantic heroes of the silver screen whom they replaced. 
His attitudes to women and sex were to be examined and pigeon-holed largely, as he said, because of his interpretation of Jonathan in the very commercially and intriguingly titled Carnal Knowledge which delivered all the sexual <tag "537626">promise</> that the title suggests, with a cacophony of adventures in lust and love, sufficient for some to consider it worthy of being banned altogether. 

801408
Sherrill Milnes makes an outstanding Gerard, tough and abrasive but with a vein of nobility too, superbly controlled and finely detailed in the big monologue, Nemico della patria. 
Best of all is Placido Domingo in the name part, passionately heroic, with the voice already giving <tag "537573">promise</> of great Otellos ahead, and there it is fascinating to compare his performance with that of Beniamino Gigli, whose favourite role this was, and whose 1942 wartime recording has just been transferred to CD by EMI, as one of a new Gigli series.

But then last week, in a succession of unconnected incidents, some Labour MPs, notably Dave Nellist, lost their tempers. 
Mr Foster is <tag "537527">promising</> to respond with a lecture to the weekly meeting of the PLP today warning MPs to exercise a special self-control in the next two weeks in the face of `provocative government tactics".

The streets of Abingdon will soon host the largest collection of MG sports cars seen in the town for more than a decade as the MG Car Club celebrates its Diamond Jubilee. 
The main purpose of what <tag "537563">promises</> to be a major international gathering in the former home of the much-loved marque, is to celebrate the opening of the club's new office headquarters and archive centre in Cemetery Road close to where the former factory once stood. 

801414
`Time to move from dialogue to change" said another. 
Freedom to travel, already <tag "537527">promised</>, has given way in the list of priorities to free elections, the legalisation of New Forum, the opposition group, and the disbanding of the secret police.   

801415
He recognized that the French had genuine, though in his opinion groundless, fears. 
He sought to remove these fears by <tag "537527">promises</> of British support which, he was confident, would never be called on. 

801416
One avenue open to Mr Lawson which has been pursued by Norman Tebbit, a former Tory Party chairman, is to take on a series of non-executive directorships in British industry. 
Alternatively, there are some senior positions in the higher echelons of British industry due to become vacant over the next few years. 
Sir Eric Sharp, chairman of Cable and Wireless, is thought to be keen to stand down, though his job may already have been <tag "537527">promised</> to Lord Young, who was ousted from the Cabinet in the last reshuffle.   

801417
AROUND the world, some 95 million engines are produced annually for automotive, marine, aircraft and industrial use.

It was unlikely that they would find another opportunity before he left. 
`Oh Nevil!" It was now that she came closest to breaking her promise and begging him to change his mind and stay. 
It was only with supreme willpower that she stopped herself and kept her <tag "538409">promise</> Their mood for the rest of the evening remained sombre, but extremely loving and tender. 

801422
One consents not only to actions but also to the holding of certain positions and to the imposition of duties and burdens. 
Promises quite often concern the actions of others: to consent to be governed by another is to promise to obey him; to consent to his joining the expedition is to promise to provide him with the facilities and the help made available to members of the expedition. 
Finally these examples in which to consent is to <tag "537527">promise</> refute the suggestion that in one case the purpose is to confer rights and in the other to undertake an obligation. 

801423
The Wallstrasse branch, one of five Deutsche Bank branches in the East German capital and 130 in the country as a whole, opened only a week ago and has had a steady stream of potential customers ever since as the West German banks embark on a drive for new business. 
Sunday's opening <tag "537563">promises</> to be a colourful and chaotic event, with the bank open 12 hours. 

801424
`We have no intention of imposing our views on others," he said. 
Even South Africa seemed to have buried the hatchet with Swapo, and President F W de Klerk promised his co-operation `in a spirit of good-neighbourliness". 
But there was less harmony in Pretoria itself, where the government has <tag "537527">promised</> to investigate allegations that the security police ran a death squad to eliminate political opponents, notably the ANC.

Cowley's unbeaten run continued with a comfortable 28-0 victory over Bramall High and Hymers returned to form to beat Leeds GS 29-6.

BR is now likely to pick a route through south London, substantial parts of which will travel overground and link to what it calls the existing `footprint" of BR track. 
The environmental compromise of tunnelling under London &dash. forced on a reluctant BR by the Government &dash. threatened to blight property in the vicinity. 
The prospect of running high-speed trains overground <tag "537563">promises</> to provoke an even greater outcry.

I sell Amway products because the company operates only by direct selling (not through retail shops), and I saw being a distributor as a chance for me to raise funds for NCT (and my kids' playgroup!) 
NCT has given me such a lot as I have moved twice when each of my children was 6 months, and as I attended really brilliant ante-natal classes before I had Debbie &ellip. and now that I am starting out on my ante-natal teacher training which will cost the branch #250 (This is actually the cheapest training offered by any charity e.g. a Relate counsellor costs #600 to train!), I want to raise some of the money myself. 
If some of you have had bad experiences with other `Amway people" let me <tag "537527">promise</> that I am not like that!

Worse still, signs of renewed unrest have emerged. 
About 700 people have been arrested during the past few days in police raids on shanty towns outside Rosario, where 14 people died in food riots in May. 
Resentment at the rich has helped propel the populist Mr Menem and his Peronist movement to power, but also <tag "537563">promises</> to make his first days in office testing ones.

Lapierre also won the European Free Handicap, but later became known as a thorough rogue, earning this dismissive epitaph in a well-known trade publication: `One to leave alone." 
Calapaez made a <tag "537614">promising</> reappearance at Ascot on Saturday when chasing home Toby Balding's Forest Sun over two miles. 

801437
The additional freedom, `in exceptional circumstances" (which the commission will define for itself) to reject the highest bid, gives the commissioners one further tool which they will need if they are to exercise their regulatory function with acceptable firmness of purpose. 
Another useful tool is the performance bond, a very substantial lump sum to be deposited with the commission. 
This would be lost if the franchise holder failed to live up to the <tag "538411">promises</> made before the licence to broadcast was granted.

Thomas Pynchon &dash. whoever she is &dash. has, after 17 years of silence, written a new novel, Vineland, which describes the tribulations of sixties children in the eighties, full of wild-sounding conspiracy theories and terrific jokes. 
Ian McEwan, on the other hand, has chosen to set The Innocent or The Special Relationship in Berlin, 1955. 
It is a <tag "537614">promising</> setting for the sort of spooky deceits which McEwan excels in dramatising, but given recent events the chilly backdrop might seem, well, unlucky.

She competed successfully for a post-doctoral research fellowship at one of the less fashionable women's colleges.

Ms Ginn, who works as a book repairer and restorer, regards it as a `luxury to design a binding". 
The works bound are generally limited editions printed by private presses, and the gold and leather bindings created by hours of intensive work means that prices range from #500 to as high as #16,500.

In practice this meant medieval mystery plays at York, madrigals on the river at Cambridge, and the Edinburgh Festival. 
And yet the Festival proved not to be the beginning of the new civically planned and visually gayer Britain of which it held out a <tag "537566">promise</>, but the swan-song of the era in which it was patriotic to put the community first and all pull together, as directed.

And since landing charges are about a tenth of airline cost on such short-haul routes, this would push up costs by 4 per cent at the UK end.

A memorandum from the department to the Social Security Advisory Committee says the cash is coming from a saving of between #70m and #80m a year in spending on statutory sick pay.

801543
TRANSPORT ministers and British Rail directors yesterday insisted that the King's Cross rail development scheme should go ahead despite the collapse of the #3.5 billion Eurorail high speed train scheme. 
The uncertainty surrounding the Channel Tunnel rail link does `not invalidate progress on the bill" (to build the #600 million terminal extension), Roger Freeman, the transport minister, told yesterday's conference in London of local authority associations. 
<tag "537527">Promising</> that the Government had not ruled out the possibility of backing any future rail link scheme with money, Mr Freeman said: `There is absolutely no reason why progress on a bill should not proceed."   

801544
Eventually Vishwendra Singh appeared. 
The 27-year-old heir to the Bharatpur fortune stood on the back porch of the hunting lodge, dispensing <tag "537566">promises</> and patronage with an easy grin.

801547
At Mezhdurechensk, where the miners' strike began early on Monday, workers defied the strike committee's advice to go back to work. 
Instead of reporting for the night shift early yesterday, they decided to hold rallies outside the pit gates. 
According to Tass, the strikers are demanding that privileges for officials be abolished, and that a new constitution be adopted incorporating all the reform <tag "537527">promises</> of the past three years.   

801548
Until a few days ago, it was officially employing a million people out of a population of 23 million and was undoubtedly paying three or four million others as informers. 
Food and energy privations were so severe that the Securitate attracted recruits relatively easily with the <tag "537566">promise</> of extra rations.  

801549
Mrs Giri is one of only 46 women among the more than 500 candidates representing the ruling Congress (I) party in this month's election. 
To Mrs Giri's dismay &dash. if not to her surprise &dash. Rajiv Gandhi, the Prime Minister, has not lived up to his <tag "537566">promises</> to bring more women into politics.  

801550
`Then let them talk." 
Yet Moran made no move towards her, <tag "537527">promised</> nothing, gave no hint of any reciprocation of interest, lent her no support.   

801551
Indians have always known the Congress Party to be sluggish and corrupt and and inefficient; it is not, therefore, blamed for dissappointed hopes. 
But Rajiv Gandhi is, because he had vowed to purge the party of its wheeler-dealers, dangled the vision of `a government that works faster" and <tag "537527">promised</> to lead Indians into the shining dawn of a 21st century where no one would starve.   

801552
They enter the New Year two points clear at the top of the First Division, a position they never achieved during Graham Lowe's last season, and it is possible John Monie has not only brought the club continuity but effected an improvement. 
When he first arrived at Central Park, Monie <tag "537527">promised</> a subtle change of emphasis, saying it might take three or four months for his influence to show through.  

801553
PRAGUE (Reuter) &dash. Czechoslovak authorities have released a human rights activist, Miroslav Kusy, who was held on charges of subversion.

801554
`He came unto his own, and his own received him not." 
Nor are those who do receive him <tag "537527">promised</> either success or comfort.   

801555
The moral to be drawn from polls of that sort is that spending money on roads is going to win votes. 
The ministers concerned must have congratulated themselves that politically at least they had done the right thing by ignoring the environmental bodies and <tag "537527">promising</> eight-lane motorways and an expenditure of #12.4 billion to ensure that 1992 does not leave Britain stuck in a permanent traffic jam.   

801556
However, as the fighting showed no sign of abating yesterday, he declared a state of siege and a curfew, and said that constitutional guarantees would be suspended. 
The rebel Faribundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) had <tag "537527">promised</> to step up the war, to disprove government assertions that the rebels were weak militarily, as well to force the government to make concessions in the peace talks that started in September.   

801557
FOR A government which once prided itself on introducing civil-service efficiency and streamlining bureaucracy, the business of issuing (or rather not issuing) new passports has become a joke &dash. a very bad joke at that. 
After a couple of summers which have seen the passport queue at London's Petty France office stretch beyond three months, travellers were hoping that the Home Office might soon start action. 
Various junior ministers at the Home Office have made apologetic noises about problems caused by EC standardisation and new computers, but all have <tag "537527">promised</>, at various times, that Something Would be Done.   

801558
Correction (published 26 October 1989) incorporated into this article. 
First Edition RICHARD BRANSON, head of Virgin records, <tag "537527">promised</> yesterday to fund further legal defences by the Irish Family Planning Association if more prosecutions are brought for selling condoms at the Virgin shop in Dublin.

S.T. is definitely accepted, and nothing now can stop it." 
He again <tag "537527">promised</> a letter from John Wright, but instead it was he who again wrote at the end of October, `You obviously haven't read my letter carefully."   

801560
The reviewers liked them. 
He had stepped up from `<tag "537614">promising</>" to `reliable'. 

801561
He brought to his new post a delight in ingenious methods. 
Balloons deluged Germany with news of Allied successes, and the German lines with certificates <tag "537527">promising</> good treatment for those who surrendered.   

801562
At its fourth congress in 1901, the Bund adopted the position taken by the southern Slavs at the Brno congress of the Austrian Social Democrats (the Bauer position). 
The RSDLP should be reorganized as a federal party, with the Bund being recognized as the sole representative of Jewish workers and the party programme <tag "537527">promising</> `personal cultural autonomy" (that is, all Jewish workers, regardless of where they lived in the empire, would be members of a national Jewish association, responsible for all Jewish educational and cultural affairs).  

801563
For, as I said earlier, the dominoes are falling fast. 
Before they have even licked their stamps, there may be revelations from Eastern Europe that may make even my observations look mild. 
WHILE we are <tag "537527">promised</> it will not happen again, the match that may well decide the destiny of this season's First Division trophy has to compete with the scrum descending on Twickenham this afternoon.   

801564
However, the excellence of the Mac's graphics handling and operating system is at odds with HyperCard's lack of colour. 
HyperCard 2, expected at next month's MacWorld in Boston, may <tag "537563">promise</> an answer, but Silicon Beach's SuperCard offers colour here and now, and is HyperCard-compatible.   

801565
EIGHT Conservative MPs voted against the Government last night as ministers reversed a defeat suffered in the House of Lords over the way the new care in the community policy is to be financed. 
MPs voted by 312 to 238 (Government majority 74) to remove plans to `ring-fence" new funds to be paid to local authorities to finance the care in the community scheme. 
The rebellion fizzled out after the Health Secretary, Kenneth Clarke, <tag "537527">promised</> a new specific grant for voluntary bodies involved in preventing and treating drug and alcohol abuse. 

801566
The analogy with promising can serve here as well. 
It may have been wrong to promise to give my son fireworks, for they are too dangerous. 
But having made the <tag "538411">promise</> it may now be my duty to give him the fireworks. 

801567
In addition to the Morland Cup presentation, Oxford mail sports editor Stuart Earp will present the Ron Grimshaw Memorial Trophy to the man of the match. 
PAUL Brown the <tag "537614">promising</> young Witney second row forward gets his big chance tonight when he plays for Southern Counties Under 21 at Marlow, Bucks, tonight.  

801568
There was, for one thing, an obligation of honour. 
The Great Powers, Great Britain and France, who had <tag "537527">promised</> to aid Poland and had tried to aid Norway, could not turn away from small countries on their very doorstep.  

801569
Only lsabel Lavender slept on, unconcerned with garden fe&circ.tes, despising the common enthusiasm. 
In the kitchen, her sister baked, in secret, the final batch of the <tag "537625">promised</> cakes, and opened the garden door while she did so, to enjoy the August morning.

Indeed, in 1983 he won at Luchon. 
The morning dawned misty at Cauterets, but it was not the low rain cloud of previous days. 
There was <tag "537573">promise</> of sun, and much cheery whistling and animated talk as the riders assembled in the town square.   

801572
The 1990 election campaigns are confirming that this lesson was well learnt: candidates are indulging in ghoulish rivalry in support of execution. 
In California all three candidates for governor have <tag "537527">promised</> to keep the gas chamber busy. 

801573
I put the club away and shoved the ball into my pocket; nobody was getting them. 
I'd <tag "537527">promised</> a policeman my overalls for charity so he got them.   

801574
Telling all to Holly did not take long, and Holly accused Rain of holding back. 
`I <tag "537655">promise</> you," Rain protested.

Her cousin Emma won the intermediate discus with 45.18 metres. 
Among the boys, Slough's Adrian Patrick and David Simpson of Croydon wafted through the heats to try to keep their <tag "538409">promise</> of making the intermediate boys" 400 metres final today the race of the championships.   

801576
Two years later the US Congressional Select Committee on missing persons in South-East Asia learned that President Nixon had agreed to post-war reconstruction assistance `in the range of dollars 3.25bn". 
Nixon's <tag "537566">promise</> was contained in a letter to Pham Van Dong, Prime Minister of North Vietnam, dated 1 February 1973.   

801577
Today the mass protests of thousands of East Germans are forcing a reluctant party leadership to embark on changes that a liberal party leadership in Hungary began to volunteer a year ago. 
In East Germany, there is the <tag "537566">promise</> of massive aid from West Germany to cushion the possible transformation.  

801578
You can sit out on the terrace to enjoy your meal which is buffet style offering a wide choice of menu and a temptation to over indulgence. 
After dinner, the hotel cabaret and band take over the easy task of keeping you happy. 
As you sip coffee and liqueurs in the Aquarium bar with new-found friends, you'll hear yourself making the firm <tag "538411">promise</> `I'll be back".   

801579
A reluctance to take a stand about racism, in fact indifference to it, has been shown again and again by head teachers. 
In December 1977 the Headmistress of St Anselm's School in Canterbury, one of Britain's leading Roman Catholic Comprehensives, allowed a teacher who was a National Front candidate to continue in her post alter she had <tag "537527">promised</> that her National Front views would not affect her treatment to black pupils.   

801580
On a visit to Brazil last week, Britain's Minister for Overseas Development, Mr Chris Patten, praised Mr Burch, a 35-year-old Londoner who worked with the Forestry Commission on the Isle of Mull before coming to Brazil eight years ago. 
Mr Patten <tag "537527">promised</> to help Mr Burch, who had flown 3,000 miles from his Amazon forest home to meet him at a lunch for British businessmen in Sao Paulo.   

801581
Wages fell heavily in every industry during 1921, sometimes after a strike, sometimes without one. 
The <tag "537566">promises</> of `a fit country for heroes to live in" seemed a mockery.   

801582
`WHY DO these travellers persist in pretending they're all alone, without a film crew?" groaned many previewers, The Independent's among them, when the new series of Great Journeys came chugging round the bend and into sight. 
Already Michael Palin had <tag "537563">promised</>, when setting off Around the World in 80 Days, not to pretend he was alone, though there must have been some viewers puzzled by his habit of calling his invisible companions Passepartout.   

801583
Too much of what I read in the press today is ill-thought-out and superficial." 
The innovations he <tag "537527">promises</> are hardly the kind to set pulses racing: more in-depth analysis of `processes within the party", interviews with Politburo members after the regular weekly meetings and detailed coverage of developments at the grass roots. 

801584
Poland's next general election is not due until 1993, but there are local ones on May 27th &dash. and meanwhile the government is already well set on the capitalist road. 
Even Bulgaria has <tag "537527">promised</> free elections, though not yet set a date.   

801585
`I've waited for a long time to get this chance. 
Other champions have ducked me.

Some of the plans will almost certainly drop off the timetable for 1991-92. 
The replacement of Littlemore's worst two wards &dash. Phoenix and Marlborough Court &dash. is among the schemes under threat. 
Less than two months ago, the regional health authority <tag "537527">promised</> #335,000 for the project.   

801587
This is one person who can't be quoted, but apparently this had to do with the description of John Major during that leadership crisis. 
Apparently he <tag "537527">promised</> not to attack Douglas Hurd personally, but then quotes stitched him up and hung him out to dry over the classlessness thing.   

801588
Mr Bush admitted that the announcement had taken Washington by surprise. 
If the <tag "537566">promise</> of the East German authorities was kept to, he said, the Berlin wall `will have very little relevance &ellip   

801590
British filmmakers often talk about the need to make films that touch universal themes, but too rarely has there been an environment that would stimulate filmmaking on that sort of level. 
One looks around in vain at the film industry of the early 1990s to find the glimmer of an understanding about how to establish a process that would take every <tag "537614">promising</> story and realize its inner potential, a process that would draw the key participants on a film into a hunt for the kernel of a film at the heart of an interesting idea. 

801591
`I'm damned sure they will," he said. 
Usually he called my work `<tag "537614">promising</>" or `almost too original" or `full of potential" or `a bit ahead of the market" or any one of those predictable, embarrassed and therefore embarrassing phrases which are meant to soften the fact that be thought he would not be able to place it anywhere `for the moment".   

801592
Certainly not. 
In Homer Agamemnon excuses his behaviour by pointing to the action of Ate on his mind; but it does not occur to him to deny his responsibility, or to shuffle out of paying the enormous compensation which he has <tag "537527">promised</> to Achilles.   

801593
The note ends in a series of kisses and what appears to be `From Anto". 
Deputy hospital general manager Mr Seamus Mannion <tag "537527">promised</> that the money would go towards a play area for children on level four.   

801594
Sir John French was instructed to go to Maubeuge. 
On 19 August Kitchener sent the fifth division to France; on 1 September, when French lost his nerve, Kitchener <tag "537527">promised</> to send the sixth also.   

801595
It was no doubt unreasonable that the Arabs of Palestine should pay the whole price for what was a world problem, anti-semitism. 
On the other hand, British governments had made repeated promises to the Jews. 
Now the <tag "538410">promises</> were broken &dash. too difficult to carry out, too expensive and worrying. 

801596
The only untoward incident involved a man who refused to move until his luggage was found. 
He won a <tag "537566">promise</> from Cathay Pacific that they would put it on the next flight.   

801597
It follows that people's interest in being able to bind themselves is the basis of a power to promise which they possess and of an obligation to keep promises they make. 
But neither the power nor the obligation point to a right to promise. 
The right exists because the very same interest on which the power to <tag "537527">promise</> and the duty to keep promises are based is also the ground for holding others to be subject to a duty not to interfere with one's promising. 

801598
Sheridan, yet to make his League debut for Forest after his #600,000 move from Leeds in the summer, had talks with Ron Atkinson yesterday. 
THE COMMITTEE responsible for hiring the Football League's new chief executive yesterday dismissed as unfair and inaccurate the accusation that they had broken <tag "538410">promises</>, confidentiality and their own constitution during their protracted search which finally ended on Monday with the appointment of Arthur Sandford from Nottinghamshire county council, writes Joe Lovejoy.   

801599
Mr Major was a much-liked and respected Chief Secretary but has no great reputation as a House of Commons man. 
I witnessed Mr Smith the other day at a private function, addressing a fat-cat audience of the great and the good convened from all of western Europe and eager to know if Labour was really to be taken seriously once more, either as a threat or a <tag "537566">promise</>.

`I'd like to know the significance of Linda Gower's outburst." 
For three nights Rain went to the nightclub, an accommodating barmaid <tag "537527">promising</> to point out Drummond.   

801602
Instead Norman Fowler, the Secretary of State for Employment, found the ranks closed against him. 
The evident commitment of the 11 to the project virtually ensures that the Strasbourg summit on 8 and 9 December will end with Margaret Thatcher being formally outvoted on what <tag "537563">promises</> to be a central plank of Community policy in the next decade. 

801603
The plans miscarried. 
The Germans had never meant their <tag "537566">promises</> seriously; and when Casement landed from a German submarine on Good Friday, it was with a warning to call off the rising, not with German arms or German soldiers. 

801604
Then she asked to be left alone with him and spoke in a whisper. 
She made mention of their days together, the <tag "538411">promises</> they had made, and how they were going abroad as a team to convert heathens.   

801605
He had previously won over a mile at Kempton but there must be some doubt about him staying one and a half miles. 
Dorset Duke has so far failed to live up to his <tag "537614">promising</> two-year-old form but he may be waiting for soft ground.   

801606
Customer services manager Mr Charles Walker said: `This reveals an improved standard of service from British Gas &dash. people are obviously more satisfied with us." 
Throughout the country the number of complaints received by the council fell by 23 per cent. 
BGS says that figures in the council's annual report, and initiatives by British Gas, support the privatisation <tag "537566">promise</> that standards of service to customers would not be compromised for profit.   

801607
The long frustrating months of separation now made Harley seem like an impossible conquest. 
She must, he thought as he crossed the Thames by Chelsea Bridge, be used to men who were smarter, wittier, and certainly taller, than he, men with more time to court her, able to offer her participation in their useful lives, <tag "537527">promising</> untroubled, committed relationships, not the public ordeal which was all his company implied.   

801608
THE LIBERALISATION of civil aviation in Europe will fail unless European Community governments unite to cure congestion, according to Dr Gunter Eser, director-general of the International Air Transport Association. 
The abolition of duty-free facilities between European states and the threat to impose VAT on tickets would lead to dearer fares not cheaper ones, which the EC had <tag "537527">promised</> would be a direct result of liberalisation, he said.   

801609
It was tempting to see its potential as another fun palace or shopping centre or &dash. this being Liverpool &dash. housing estate. 
It is too soon to be sure that any such desecration has been avoided, but the excellent scheme by Allies and Morrison which has now been adopted is already on course for completion by the arrival of the Tall Ships in 1992. 
With Paul Appleton as the project architect, Allies and Morrison is <tag "537527">promising</> a park and tree-lined square, which will leave an uninterrupted view of the existing buildings from the river.   

801610
But why is it a right? 
The interest on which it is based validates the <tag "537614">promising</> principle, namely: If a person communicates an intention to undertake by that very act of communication a certain obligation then he has that obligation. 

801611
Miss Robertson, who is a registered nurse for the mentally handicapped, will be joined by Jules Haston, 20, who lives in Grays Road, Headington, and works as a care assistant with an Oxfordshire community unit.

Dunwoody's firm conclusion on the race was this: `I have won a Grand National and a Gold Cup, but this was something else." 
As if to prove that every great athlete's status is ultimately transitory, Celtic Shot, a former champion hurdler, walked out to continue his progress as a <tag "537614">promising</> novice chaser less than half an hour after Desert Orchid's return to the winners' enclosure.

801615
He took conservative ideas on privatisation and land reform, gave them a populist anti-government bent and managed to woo over many poorer voters &dash. especially in northern Mexico &dash. who previously feared that the PAN represented only business interests. 
He <tag "537527">promised</> to demystify the all-powerful presidency and make it more accountable to congress and the voter.

The letter was organised by the Bishop of Stepney, the Rt Rev Jim Thompson, and also signed by the bishops of Salisbury, Oxford, Southwark, St Edmundsbury and Ipswich, Lincoln, Worcester, Bristol, and Gloucester, and the suffragan bishops of Dover, Croydon and Stepney. 
These writings are the latest skirmishes in what <tag "537563">promises</> to be a struggle bitter even by ecclesiastical standards over the next few weeks. 

801619
They're justification for the `he-man" tag, with heavy everything at low speeds and not much more than a token lightening up as you press on harder, but not so heavy as to wipe out the sports car's essential touch of delicacy. 
The big mass up front guarantees initial understeer and the ample power to the back <tag "537563">promises</> the balancing availability of power oversteer.   

801620
The traditional way of disseminating and institutionalising information within the services and among language groups is not in the main by the written word but by showing and sharing. 
If you have spent a twelve hour day coping with the daily realities of road accidents, the elderly incontinent, housing the homeless &dash. usually with inadequate resources &dash. I <tag "537655">promise</> you that you rarely want to go home and read about it.

THE riddle to determining the sex of a child may finally have been solved, scientists announced today. 
In what <tag "537563">promises</> to be a scientific landmark, groups from the Medical Research Council and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund say they may have found an elusive sex-determining gene.

On the big day itself, Glemby has offered #50 worth of hairdressing, so our bride can treat herself to a new style &dash. and make sure her man looks his well-groomed best, too.

801624
It was decided that Mr Conroy would commission a bronze of Nicola to which they would all contribute. 
Alas, alas, when the bronze was delivered, months later, Mr Conroy indeed paid for it but did not receive the <tag "537625">promised</> donations.   

801625
It concerns Ms Jennifer Graham's suit, backed by the Humane Society of the United States and the Animal Legal Defence Fund against her Victorville School District, California, which forced Ms Graham against her moral and `religious" convictions, to dissect a leopard frog in a biology class. 
In the early stages of what <tag "537563">promises</> to be a furious legal debate, the school district offered Ms Graham an already-dead frog to dissect, but Ms Graham, whose mother is (perhaps irrelevantly, perhaps not) a publicity-conscious Animal Rights campaigner, refused, alleging she could not be certain of the provenance or `natural" death of said frog.   

801626
HIGH interest rates made it a certainty that the Severn Trent Water group would beat its prospectus forecast, and it did by #8.9 million at #129.9 million. 
Chairman John Bellak <tag "537527">promised</> to deliver the much-overdue investment programme on time and at or below budget.   

801627
But both stem from a common core, i.e. the interest of persons to be able to forge normative bonds with others. 
That is why they coexist, and one has the power to promise if and only if one has the right to do so. 
The right to make a particular <tag "538411">promise</> (e.g., to visit my aunt next weekend) is a derivative right of the general right to promise. 

801628
It has forged an extraordinary symbiotic relationship with Liverpool, Redmond's home town. 
MTV pays half the salary of the film liaison officer, opens a #3 million media training centre in 1991 (with #5 million endowment to boot) and has a policy of recruiting locally. 
Redmond clearly wants Channel Five; his spokesman hints at a rather superior style of programming from a putative MTV station &dash. perhaps to upstage Shah's <tag "537566">promise</> to provide `general entertainment."

Professor Will Waites, chairman of the panel and professor of food microbiology at Nottingham University, said that at the height of the eggs crisis the Ministry of Agriculture had found ` #19m overnight" to support egg producers but had cut 77 jobs out of 600 at the Institute of Food Research.

In 1326 somebody set fire to the peat moor in the Brue valley,  with the idea of burning Glastonbury Abbey. 
The bishop followed up this  preliminary scorching with a <tag "537566">promise</> of eternal fire for the abbot of Glastonbury,  upon whom he pronounced sentence of excommunication for the sin of damaging  his property.

General acceptance in the rest of the United Kingdom that agricultural land-drainage schemes should cease to be regarded as a priority has by no means arrived in Northern Ireland, where the system devised by the Department of Agriculture for assessing the costs of agricultural drainage, together with the secrecy with which it is shrouded, has been heavily criticized by the Northern  Ireland Economic Council. 
The harvests of drainage in this wet climate will be more milk and butter to add to the European surplus. 
Yet in 1987, investment <tag "537563">promises</> to continue unabated.

SHAREHOLDERS in Monotype, the laser-based, photo typesetting equipment maker, must have thought Christmas had arrived early yesterday morning. 
No sooner had they digested news of an agreed #32m bid on Friday from Pointplus, a US investment partnership, at 150p a share, compared with 110p ahead of the offer, than the Monotype share price roared ahead to 171p on talk of buying by a rival.

Since the beginning of this month, British-Borneo's share price has risen by about 100p, or a fifth, as new management spreads the gospel of a fresh, or revived, strategy around the City.

801861
Losing their full-back, Nick Marment, with a leg injury after 57 minutes was a blow but not an excuse for Gloucester's surprising failure to maintain their stranglehold. 
Saracens showed spirit and resilience, but even that would have counted for little had not Gloucester surrendered so much second-half possession, especially from <tag "537614">promising</> attacking situations.   

801862
The second half brought an improvement, but only after the full-back Mironov had switched with his outside half, Dzagnidze, and shownthat in the first half he had been wasted.

The Conservative government in Britain in 1990 still gave priority to fighting inflation, which was rising more steeply than in its commercial competitors.

Matata built a fire over which we cooked a supper of beans and rice while he caught a fish with a piece of string and what seemed very little else. 
The night air amplified the snort and splash of animals and I was very grateful for the orange glow of the fire through the canvas walls of the tent.

The wry smile which accompanied this remark suggested he thought quite the opposite would happen in the Government.

Many of the issues now facing Lord Crickhowell will be directly affected by his ability to keep public goodwill, which he can do only by convincing people of his good intentions towards the environment. 
For instance, he <tag "537527">promises</> to use publicity to shame polluters, and for that to work he must assure the public that the NRA is worth taking notice of.

But he warned that Britain would resist any attempt by France at next month's EC summit in Strasbourg to cite the opening of the East-West German border as a force for wider EC economic union. 
The broader implications of events in Berlin and eastern Europe should now top the agenda in Strasbourg, Mr Hurd said. 
His remarks, during his first appearance as Foreign Secretary before the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, <tag "537527">promised</> continuing conflict within the EC on economic policy, and foreshadowed latent tension between Margaret Thatcher and some senior ministers on the timing of ERM membership.

The speech came generally as a surprise, and many presumed, when it was announced that Hitler would speak, that he would report the capture of Stalingrad. 
In the absence of anything so spectacular, the most impressive parts of the speech were those which declared how Germany had successfully surmounted the most severe test in the previous winter, and those indicating the exploitation of the material resources of the occupied territories and giving rise to hopes of improved foodstuff provisioning at home. 
A further boost was given to these hopes by Go&umlaut.ring's speech, four days later, at the Harvest Thanksgiving Festival, <tag "537527">promising</> an improvement in the availability of foodstuffs.

Mr Usta then demanded #5,000 for the operation because he thought that an Englishman able to afford to go to a hospital like the Wellington Humana could pay more. 
Mr Kunter placated him by <tag "537527">promising</> the extra cash, but Mr Usta never received it. 

801907
The lure of big money was on the way and director Bob Rafelson had fortunately obtained Jack's signature for another BBS film before the price went up and put him back on track as a counter-culture player, a route which Nicholson analysed in terms of the way he wanted his career to go. 
There were plenty of <tag "537566">promises</> of big money, fame, glamour, fast cars and all the trappings that any actor might lust towards.

801912
We should remind ourselves that while the promisee may not be the initiator of the bond of which the promise is the whole or a part, he is not entirely passive either. 
It is always up to him to waive his right under the promise and thus terminate the binding force of the promise. 
It is this general interest which explains why every <tag "537566">promise</>, and not only those performance of which is to the specific advantage of the promisee, creates a right in the promisee.

`I don't like Wimbledon," Rush was saying, `I don't like it."

It was no doubt unreasonable that the Arabs of Palestine should pay the whole price for what was a world problem, anti-semitism. 
On the other hand, British governments had made repeated <tag "538411">promises</> to the Jews.

Think of what such a lump sum could mean to you, especially if  &dash. as for most people &dashq. your 65th birthday marked  your retirement. 
Depending on the amount, you could put it towards paying off a  mortgage, extending your home, taking a special holiday, even  moving house &dash. things you may have <tag "537624">promised</> yourself for  years, comforts you will certainly have earned by the time you  retire.

He agreed with sources in British Telecom who put the number of calls to sex lines at about 45 million in 1988/89. 
Campaigners against pornography believe that an explanation for why the callers fail to realise that the sex line advertisements' <tag "537566">promises</> are largely false rests with the allegedly addictive nature of pornography.   

801920
`The most difficult period is the first one because it breaks economic, legislative, bureaucratic structures, mentalities and practices accumulated in so many years of dictatorship." 
The speech was liberal in character, <tag "537527">promising</> that the new government would allow market forces and a strong political opposition.

Over the past year, more than 1,000 rural households in Oxfordshire have opted for a supply and we are doing our best to extend the benefit of gas even further. 
At this stage I am able to say that we have had a very <tag "537614">promising</> response from North Leigh.   

801924
It may also be that there is a limitless number of possible candidates for a form which need to be ruled out, and so we never could come to a single end of exclusion and rejection. 
The <tag "537566">promise</> that `there will remain at the bottom, all light opinions vanishing into smoke, a Form affirmative, solid and true and well defined" is one that we may not always find easy to bring to fulfilment.

He advanced on her, furious, banging his fist down on the desk in front of her, `I wanted him to see what the system was doing to people, not to sit here in this office hearing it at second hand." 
An echo down the years, her first editor: `Never trust a <tag "537566">promise</>, always see for yourself."

It has made everything much more difficult. 
According to the Israelis, when Shamir saw Bush in Washington he was able to get, as the price for no pre-emptive attack on Iraq, a <tag "537566">promise</> that the US would not actually support a conference on the Middle East when the war was over.

A small crowd gathered around me afterwards, and I signed several evening papers and a programme.

Auriol's getting the dresses sent to London &dash. we'll do 'em in the studios in half the time without the Chambre Syndicale breathing down our necks."

It recommended that a subsidy of #4.9m should be provided during the financial year 1984-85, and the Government, accepting this advice, increased its grant to the Arts Council accordingly. 
The Minister for the Arts reported to Parliament that the increased subsidy would enable the company to `operate on a satisfactory basis in the future" and <tag "537527">promised</> that `provision will also be made for subsequent years." 

801931
Finally these examples in which to consent is to promise refute the suggestion that in one case the purpose is to confer rights and in the other to undertake an obligation. 
Promising differs from consenting in two respects. 
Both establish <tag "537566">promises</> to be a special case of consent. 

801932
Clients should be able to change their `care manager" much as they can change GP if they do not like the service they are being offered. 
CHILD BENEFIT is to be frozen for the third year running, with some of the money saved going to increase benefits for the disabled and low-income families both in and out of work, Tony Newton, Secretary of State for Social Security announced yesterday. 
In announcing next April's increases in pensions and other benefits, Mr Newton <tag "537527">promised</> proposals, he hoped later this year, for a more far-reaching reform of disability benefits following the four-year study the Government commissioned from the Office of Population Censuses on Surveys.

Let that be a warning to you]" 
McInally, a robust and <tag "537614">promising</> full-back, had committed the unpardonable sin of abandoning Nottingham Forest (for Coventry) and compounded it by daring to criticise his former manager in the press.

After yesterday's meeting of European dockers' leaders, Mr Harold Lewis, general secretary of the International Transport Federation, said union leaders from the supporting countries would tell their own port employers they should not take advantage of the dispute by taking diverted cargo normally handled by British ports. 
`Employers will be told they will run the risk of a serious threat to industrial relations in their own ports if they do."

Of course, he might lose interest in the specific content of some promises, and keeping some of them may even work against his overall interest.

This interest is the very one which is reflected in his right to <tag "537566">promise</>.   

801939
Warren Jacques, the men's senior team manager, urged the appointment of `more Mark Coxs, coaches with international experience" to give aspiring players what they needed most: `intensive professional training, day in and day out".

In all such cases you may not be satisfied to receive even large damages for the wrong done; and what the amount of damages is to be may be very uncertain. 
At any rate, if damages are the only thing to be got, your wealthy neighbour might buy the right to annoy you. 
It was to meet cases of this kind that Equity invented the great remedies of specific performance and injunction: specific performance to compel a man actually to do what he has <tag "537527">promised</> &dash. to give you the land in return for the money, to pay you the purchase money in return for the land; injunction to forbid him to do what he has promised not to do or what he has no right to do &dash. to forbid him to open the public house or the music-school, to forbid him to build so as to block up your light, even to compel him to pull down the objectionable wall; the last sort of injunction is called mandatory.   

801941
It has three main items: the new constitution; the release of the party's leaders; and the role of the army under a civilian regime. 
The League wants the constitution that was written in 1947 for independence from Britain to be reintroduced with slight changes. 
The party may be able to bargain for the release of Miss Aung San Suu Kyi and the others in return for a <tag "537566">promise</> of no revenge for the army's role in the 1988 massacres, in which 3,000 people are believed to have died.   

801942
The camera roamed tantalisingly among the crowd; he saw half-a-dozen women who looked like her from a distance but proved to be older, more painted or just someone else. 
She was also nominated in the category of most <tag "537614">promising</> newcomer, and at last he saw her.

Having done all this, Murdoch had one last move to make. 
News Corporation has <tag "537527">promised</> its bankers that the company's debts will not exceed 110 per cent of its total value.   

801944
But his public insistence that the policy would `continue on course" was in stark contrast to attitudes within government as disclosed in the leaked minutes of a meeting between the minister and Sir John Quinton, the chairman of Barclays Bank. 
Sir John said that in a `bruising meeting" Mr MacGregor had warned him that the Prime Minister was `fizzing with fury" and was <tag "537527">promising</> retribution against the banks.

Requests that letters should not be sent to the home address or that the telephone should not be used are always respected. 
Some patients are, in spite of reassurance, unwilling to give their real names and in these cases a fictitious name is quite in order, with the one proviso that an attempt should be made to remember the false name in case a further visit should be needed. 
It is important that all patients attending a clinic have confidence in the <tag "537625">promised</> confidentiality, and that they can rest assured that this extends even to family relationships.

His mother nursed him devotedly, insisting &dash. despite the doctor's insistence to the contrary &dash. that he was pre-disposed to TB, if not already suffering from it. 
By a happy chance, one of Owen's long-held ambitions found a sympathetic echo in his doctor's recommendation that a winter in the South of France would do him good. 
He was offered part-time employment as a teacher of English in the Berlitz School in Bordeaux; his father, touchingly, <tag "537527">promised</> him a small allowance to supplement his salary; and in mid-September he stood at the rail of a steamer filling his lungs with the rich air of France.

`He forced me to sign an Arabic contract, which I did not understand, to be a domestic worker in his house.

But John Evans, for the national executive, insisted that it was unreasonable to tie the party to a strict timetable since scientists and technologists did not yet agree on how nuclear plants could be decommissioned safely.

The second was Emmanuel Steward, Hearns's manager, to whom Andries turned after the defeat. 
At the Kronk gym in Detroit, where Andries was christened `The Rock" by his spar-mates, Steward remodelled Andries's crude style, led him to a second world title in February 1989 against Tony Willis, saw him lose it to Harding, and then <tag "537527">promised</> him one last chance.

That shows how much energy is available, and it is very attractive to try and harness this, but since the turn of the century there have been over a hundred patented devices to extract energy from the waves, but we still don't have a single commercial one operating. 
However, there are a number of attractive and <tag "537614">promising</> schemes under very active development at the moment, but the sea is such a hostile environment &dash. it's corrosive, force is involved for anything sitting on the surface as they are exposed to the force of the waves which is colossal, and if they are on the sea bed then perhaps there are maintenance problems, and getting the electricity ashore has not yet been solved.

`Probably a lot of us who use IT now know to be suspicious. 
Let's face it, it's never as good as <tag "537527">promised</> and industry consistently over-promises about how easy it is to use and what it can do," he said.

It is, of course, the responsibility of every butler to devote his utmost care in the devising of a staff plan. 
Who knows how many quarrels, false accusations, unnecessary dismissals, how many <tag "537614">promising</> careers cut short can be attributed to a butler's slovenliness at the stage of drawing up the staff plan?

Mozambique's attempts to reach peaceful solutions had been wrecked by deliberate South African policy, he added. 
Even after the signing of a non-aggression treaty with South Africa in 1984: `The desired climate of coexistence was not achieved; it was frustrated by hostile forces who found ways of continuing with the same policy, despite the promises made." 
The guest of honour at the congress, the former Tanzanian president, Julius Nyerere, was more forthright than President Chissano, declaring: `All the evidence indicates that South African support for the bandits continues up to today, despite all the <tag "538411">promises</> made by the apartheid government." 

801961
In the light of its chastening guest statute experience, the California Court's ruling was as eagerly awaited as it was surprising.

One year later, Business Week in the United States will have its own say on the subject. 
Under the title `Agenda for the 21st Century: Managing Earth's Resources", the special supplement is being put together with an unusual editorial board that is drawn from industry, science, government, and environmental groups.

They may also take Mr Krenz up on his <tag "537566">promises</> to give teeth to the Volkskammer's supposedly watchdog legal and constitutional committees and to allow controversial debates.

Len was doomed always to disappoint, never to be able to deliver the depth of which his body spoke. 
Every relationship was a torment of anticipating that final inevitable moment when understanding would gleam in the Other's eyes, lighting up the vast vacancy yawning within poor Len. 
His hope was to push that moment off as long as possible, to maintain a suffering silence which the face <tag "537563">promised</> was deep and awful.

Fullblast calls me Billy Weed on account of all my plants. 
I told him they ain't weeds, but proper plants like, but he still keeps on calling me Billy Weed. 
I <tag "537527">promised</> Marie I wouldn't go out with Fullblast again.   

801996
But disillusioned by the pretence, I refused to accompany Santa on the train. 
Nonetheless I did go to the station for his arrival, because I was <tag "537527">promised</> a ride in the police car that would be leading Santa's open car down the High Street.   

801997
It was a reassuring world of sentimental conformism that was presented to the young, for the most part by singers old enough to be their fathers. 
Mr Wonderfuls still <tag "999997">promised</> them some enchanted evenings with a stranger in paradise who might well turn out to be Oh!   

801999
The packages were worth #600 million each. 
The Japanese were quick to <tag "537527">promise</> similar sums.

Stasi heads have begun to roll in ernest. 
Mr Mielke's two former deputies, Rudi Mittig and Gerhard Neiber, resigned on Tuesday and 17 top officials were summarily dismissed following charges that, despite <tag "537566">promises</>, they had not made any serious efforts to investigate allegations against the old regime.   

802001
The officers were holding a small party at the Cha&circ.teau that evening as a preparation for the great event and Ziemke had asked Genevieve to be there, especially as Hortense had again indicated her intention of dining in her room. 
`I've <tag "537527">promised</> to perform for Rommel," she told the General, 'and that will have to suffice."   

802002
A national dock strike is to go ahead from midnight tonight and up to 500,000 local government officers are to follow last week's one-day stoppage with 24-hour strikes tomorrow and on Wednesday. 
Coincidentally, Wednesday is the day of Mrs Thatcher's `summer cabinet" on the economy at which the Chancellor, Mr Nigel Lawson, and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Mr John Major, will present economic assessments before the annual public spending round which Mr Major has <tag "537527">promised</> will be a tough one. 

802003
Both purport to change the normative situation of another, and both purport to do so by voluntary acts undertaken in the belief that they have these normative consequences. 
Yet consenting and <tag "537527-n">promising</>, while overlapping, are not the same. 

802004
The Politburo issued a statement regretting for the first time the mass exodus to the West. 
It even admitted that there were `problems" &dash. a slight euphemism, given the tens of thousands of people who had attended mass protests up and down the country &dash. and hinted that the government might be to blame. 
Although the move was hailed as sensational at first sight, the vagueness of the language used to <tag "537527">promise</> `travel opportunities" and `media that are close to life" failed to convince observers that the leadership had significantly softened its attitude.   

802005
Iraq said yesterday that British officials could have `immediate" access to Mr Bazoft, who is being held in Baghdad. 
But by last night that <tag "537626">promise</> had not been made good, despite an immediate application by the British consul. 

802006
Not a bad note to go out on, is it?" 
He has <tag "537527">promised</> his wife that in retirement he will devote more time to his family: his two sons, his daughter and the five grandchildren.

The arrangements, too, settled for the sweetly seductive rather than the outright and punchy. 
The band's idea of cutting loose was to drop into a bossa nova. 
It was hard to feel invited to journey into the emotional sagas of the lyrics when their musical setting &dash. soothing, tricked out with a sense of faint <tag "537626">promise</> &dash. would have made a decent soundtrack for a ferry commercial. 

802009
Might they be more affordable? 
He <tag "537527">promised</> he would work diligently.

She had thought in the past that he was probably queer if anything but had not been interested enough in him to decide whether it was for real or just for bits of tactics. 
`Yes, I've seen so many <tag "537614">promising</> careers in the kind of business I pursue ruined by unsuitable alliances that I've fought most frightfully shy of any such entanglements in the past.   

802011
Yesterday Mr Kinnock presented a picture of a world changing so rapidly around the present government that the Prime Minister had become `out of touch, out of date and out of step with the British people". 
As she enters her second decade in power, this <tag "537563">promises</> to be an effective line of attack. 

802012
`We feel a bit insecure surrounded by all these (American) ships and military bases," Mr Gerasimov said. 
`Gorbachev gave Bush a detailed map of classified information about US installations around the Soviet Union and Bush <tag "537527">promised</> to check the map with CIA experts, since it was prepared by the KGB."

During both the official announcement of BAe's bid for Rover in March 1988 and at the time of the approval of the sale in July 1988, Lord Young, then Trade Secretary, had claimed that the Rover sale was `the deal of the decade" for the taxpayer. 
Coming two years after the fiasco when Tory backbenchers successfully blocked the sale of Rover to Ford, Young was able to <tag "537527">promise</> that BAe would invest #1 billion in the ailing car group in return for writing off debts and getting the Government and the taxpayer off the hook for future investment in the state firm.   

802014
When dawn comes, some individuals will have been unlucky and return completely empty, while those individuals that have managed to find a victim are likely to have sucked a surplus of blood. 
On a subsequent night the luck may run the other way. 
So, it looks like a <tag "537614">promising</> case for a bit of reciprocal altruism.   

802015
In a similar effort, the Washington-based Center for Foreign Journalists has been holding seminars with Latin American newspapers for their general-coverage journalists. 
In late 1988 fourteen reporters from Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru at a Quito workshop issued a challenge to their colleagues throughout the continent: `We therefore resolve to call on the Latin American press to join in educational campaigns in their communities on environmental topics, to guide governments on this, and <tag "537527">promise</> ever greater space to ecological subjects."   

802016
After years of frustrated attempts to regain control of the site, Hindu extremists brought the issue to an explosive head this year by threatening to tear down the crumbling mosque and build a temple devoted to Lord Rama. 
The dispute has been referred to the Uttar Pradesh high court and the government recently secured a tentative <tag "537566">promise</> from Hindu militants that the mosque would not be harmed pending a ruling. 

802017
The weather proved stormy. 
Eisenhower postponed invasion for twenty-four hours. 
He was <tag "537584">promised</> better weather for 6 June and, at 4 a.m. on 5 June, said: `O.K. let's go."   

802018
McGee settled it after only four minutes, and from then on in it was downhill all the way. 
Middlesbrough lacked the pace and penetration required to profit from some <tag "537614">promising</> approach work; and Wimbledon, without John Fashanu, lacked the physical foil needed to complement more subtle skills from Dennis Wise and Terry Gibson Plough Lane is not the intimidating bear-pit it once was, but Wimbledon's willingness to chase every ball again served them well, and proved that the players are still giving their all for the manager, Bobby Gould.   

802019
At present there is an ever diminishing justification for such a claim. 
But the way to make good this <tag "537527">promise</> is, I believe, to take seriously the practical / theoretical distinction and to explore it further.  

802020
It was late August and inevitably, the quay was packed with home-going Italian boats. 
Our chartered Sunsail 350, La Pietra, rode contentedly with the other anchored boats in the shimmering heat of the afternoon, and it was not until the sun turned bright orange and began to drop rapidly seawards that anyone in the boat felt like stirring. 
The forecast from Livorno has spoken of increasing winds and I laid out all the chain before we rowed ashore (feeling curiously British and eccentric using oars among so many outboards) for the pasta and wine we had been <tag "537624">promising</> ourselves since mid-morning.   

802021
One view regards the promisee's right under any particular promise as a core right based on his interest in the promised act (and the intention of the promisor to be obligated to perform the act). 
On this view, if there could be binding promises which do not benefit the promisee (and are not intended to do so) then there are promises which do not create rights in the promisee. 
Such a consequence seems at odds with the conventions of discourse concerning <tag "537566">promises</>. 

802022
All taxing trouble. 
IT began over a decade ago, when Mrs Margaret Thatcher, alone in a television studio, blithely pledged that she would abolish the rating system. 
It continued over the years as an unfulfilled <tag "537626">promise</> looking for a wheeze.   

802023
These voices command our sympathy and respect, not least because they are consistent: voices of conscience. 
Yet among Germany's European neighbours, and even in Bonn, these voices have been greeted less with respect than with relief. 
For what they <tag "537527">promise</> is also: `Don't worry, German reunification is not just round the corner."   

802024
Not far behind him was Luis Inacio da Silva, of the Workers' Party. 
Mr Da Silva showed surprising strength by running on a programme of <tag "537566">promises</> of wage and price controls, expanded health and educational facilities for the poor and, last but not least, an official moratorium on Brazil's dollars 110bn foreign debt.   

802025
Some are well-off property developers and men with extensive north London business interests. 
Mr Miller is thought to have <tag "537527">promised</> bumper returns on investments, a fact that might explain his plunge into share dealing.

Boing! 
Menace hung over that one like a drunken <tag "537566">promise</> come home to roost, but what could he say?  

802027
Let me tell you to what degree. 
This morning I telephoned my agent from the kiosk on the corner of the road to make sure that he had received the first fourteen or fifteen thousand words of my novel and, hopefully, to hear him say that, yes, he thought a publisher would give me a worthwhile advance (much needed) on the strength or <tag "537566">promise</> of this sizeable chunk.   

802028
There are some simple reasons for this: a popular collapse of faith in modern design, assorted architectural disasters, an obsession with `heritage" promoted by television dramas, advertising and the leisure industry. 
Classical architecture is valued for its inoffensiveness and reassurance, its <tag "537566">promise</> not to disturb.   

802029
`The government of the Federal Republic cannot ignore it just like that". 
The new rate is bound to be seen in East Germany and by the West German opposition as a betrayal of the political <tag "538411">promises</> made by West German Christian Democrat politicians during the East German election campaign.  

802030
Parke certainly has a brain and showed he could use it under pressure. 
But nobody coaches or motivates quite like Barrington and his personality, almost as much as Parke's burgeoning <tag "537626">promise</>, was written all over this enthralling match. 

802031
It is believed that only the 600-strong presidential guard, at Mr Kerekou's palace and residence in the nearby commercial capital of Cotonou, are still armed, for fear of a repetition of the coup attempts which have dogged the regime in recent months. 
Popular discontent with Mr Kerekou, who seized power in a bloody military coup 17 years ago <tag "537527">promising</> to deliver the long-suffering people of Benin with a radical brand of Marxism-Leninism, has reached a feverish pitch.   

802032
The intoxicating combination of physical danger, isolation and comradeship with a few men from the world outside the royal enclosure cleared his mind and gave him new energy. 
He reneged on a <tag "537566">promise</> to stay on with friends to ski, and returned to Victoria.   

802033
It is right for the public that a proper price should be paid for the franchise bidders for these rights." 
As he confirmed the party conference <tag "537566">promise</> of his predecessor Douglas Hurd to increase police strength with an extra 1100 officers next year, the Home Secretary was interrupted by demands from Jeremy Corbyn (Lab, Islington N) for a fresh investigation into the case of the Birmingham Six.   

802034
Only Milner, once the darling of the generals, stood by Lloyd George. 
Men who had <tag "537527">promised</> to win the war found it hard to resist a general who insisted that he could win it.   

802035
There was excitement in the air when the competitors filed out and squatted for their meditative warm-up before flying. 
The Minister for Information and Inspiration, sniffing cynicism, shuffled at the podium and <tag "537527">promised</> aerial jam tomorrow.

It embraces everything in the world" &dash. which might now be seen simply as an inevitable and rather dated by-blow of Forties romanticism. 
Certainly the memorials from his brief and heavily subsidised publishing career are impressive &dash. Henry Moore's Shelter Sketches, Nabokov, Anais Nin &dash. but it is impossible to separate them from the grand gestures, the <tag "537566">promises</> to publish unread books, and the living off other people's money.   

802037
Those are agent-relative reasons. 
A person who made a <tag "538411">promise</> has an agent-relative reason to keep it, even though it may derive from an agent-neutral reason to keep one's promises.   

802038
Are there any others of that sort here? 
Because if there are I <tag "537527">promise</> I'll &dash." `One on the window-sill, I think."

Ward said there would be no question of disciplining the pair because declining selection was `a matter for the individual". 
Hutchings, winner of the silver medal in the world cross country championships, has run only one 10,000 metres race &dash. at the Commonwealth trial in Birmingham last month, when he finished a long way behind Martin. 
Hanlon, a <tag "537614">promising</> 22-year-old from Edinburgh Southern Harriers, is still some way behind Rowland, who proved he is by far Britain's best in his one serious steeplechase of the year, at Crystal Palace ten days ago.

MOZAMBIQUE is facing critical food shortages due to a slow response to its latest emergency appeal, presented at a United Nations-sponsored conference in New York in April. 
Of the 916,000 tonnes of food aid requested for 1989-1990, only 295,000 tonnes have been pledged. 
The US has <tag "537527">promised</> the largest amount, 195,000 tonnes.

If you've nothing specific to go into raptures about you can get together with your favourite funsters for a light-hearted summer of life-enhancing laughter and vitality.

wouldn't that be worth a hug? 
Well, Mrs Davis, I can't <tag "537527">promise</> you a rise (and I certainly wouldn't be bold enough to ask you for a hug!) but what I can offer you is the chance to choose between a substantial pay-rise &ellip. #1,500 a year &ellip. and a cheque for the generous sum of #15,000.   

802043
Serving for the match at 5-2 in the final set, McEnroe became enraged when a human line-judge called a ball out without a peep from Cyclops. 
He reminded Gerry Armstrong, the British umpire, that he had <tag "537527">promised</> before the match that Cyclops' decisions would be final. 

802044
It is unfortunate for them that Britain has done so little to honour its obligations. 
Though in June, Whitehall <tag "537527">promised</> to devise urgently a programme to allow some the right to live in Britain, it has been `fidgeting over figures and numbers", according to Allen Lee, a senior legislative councillor.   

802045
The two went into yesterday's television debate dead even in the polls. 
Mr Coleman <tag "537527">promised</> he would not push for legislation which would severely restrict abortion in Virginia.   

802046
Other plans proved less controversial. 
There were plans for a world security organization at Dumbarton Oaks ; plans for world finance at Bretton Woods which barred any future `autarky" &dash. another British misfortune ; plans in detail for further lend-lease, which suffered from the old defect : the American negotiators made <tag "538411">promises</> which the British took as firm agreements, and Congress later did not fulfil them.   

802048
According to Sir Leon, these conditions have not been met. 
<tag "537566">Promises</> to reduce output, by closing down the Billancourt factory outside Paris, have not materialised and a proposed ruling that Renault could be subject to bankruptcy, which is not the case while it remains state-controlled, has not been forthcoming.

Sadly, they are without a leader at the moment and Gang Show producer Bill Greenough has had to drop them from his line-up: `I hope they will be back next year," he says. 
Last year the Show welcomed its 100,000th visitor and Bill, who has produced every one since 1967, <tag "537527">promises</> that those who flock to see his cast of 300 in action next week can look forward to an entertainment that is every bit as good, if not better.

As soon as the money comes, it'll be a priority. 
And in the wake of remorse came certainty that something was going tragically awry.

802053
The French Prime Minister, Michel Rocard, yesterday urged voters to join forces to `beat the National Front" next Sunday, and warned that Mr Le Pen's policies `lead only to violence". 
Mr Rocard said the National Front's gains were `obviously related to immigration problems" and <tag "537527">promised</> that the government would crack down hard on illegal immigration.

The Welsh and national media, including The Independent, have maintained a news blackout since early December at the request of police. 
`You wouldn't see a thing if you went there, not a blade of grass is out of place, I <tag "537527">promise</>," a Scotland Yard source said earlier this month.

So before each bird was judged, the owner was brought out from among a chain-smoking huddle, concealed from the action by screens. 
One of the most <tag "537614">promising</> competitors, Smokey, an African Grey parrot from Nottingham, was billed as saying `I hate Maggie", but his owner was absent for the judging, which spoilt the fun. 

802056
`Straight from the jar, baby!" I said. 
Soon she had a stomach profile as smoothly Bernoullian as my model-building Skippy spoonfuls, and I, perhaps influenced by that anecdote in Shakespeare about the votaress who got pregnant and grew, like a sail, `big-bellied with the wanton wind," began to visualize her lying with her legs strapped down in a wind tunnel wearing a shiny leotard, giving teasing effleurage to her dome, calling for a technician to apply some Chap Stick to her lips from time to time, while I, a <tag "537614">promising</> young engineer at work on the next generation of airbus wings, evaluated the inexplicable magnitude of lift her Bug-mound aroused in the moaning tunnel's air by pumping luminous gases through the smoke rake and watching their streaklines veer upward and interlace, laminarity disrupted by the brief fuss of her pubic hair, shedding into elaborate lasso shapes and beehives of induced flow that after only a few minutes of flight-speed wind made the entire research installation knock and shiver with worrisome resonances.   

802058
Mr Lula of the PT Workers' Party promises to deploy 1.5 million party militants to help sway the large numbers of undecided voters and to watch out for fraud. 
A former factory worker, Mr Lula is convinced he will contest the second round with Mr Collor and says his victory will galvanise an international workers' movement in other countries.

They were going for the gaming tables, the crocodile farm and the shows. 
The Berlin Commando did not know it, but they were making, in reverse, a journey white South Africans made in the days before sanctions, when the currency was strong and Sun City (sometimes called Sin City) did not exist. 
Such journeys were called `Pussy Cat tours" and cryptic advertisements in the papers <tag "537527">promised</> `unusual" glimpses of Hamburg and Amsterdam.

Because so much of the Quebec nationalist case, and so much of English-speaking acceptance of it, is based on unfact. 
The proponents of the Meech Lake Accord have given us a fresh un-fact: that Pierre Trudeau, during the Quebec referendum campaign of 1980, <tag "537527">promised</> `a renewed federalism" and then did not deliver.
