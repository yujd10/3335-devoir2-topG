The London and North-Western's Euston Station was first, but at the eastern end of Euston Road the Great Northern constructed their King's Cross terminal. 
Initially the Midland Railway ran into King's Cross but a quarrel over access led them to construct next door to King's Cross their St Pancras terminal, which was topped by a statue of Britannia, a <tag "510285">calculated</> snook-cocking exercise because Britannia was the company emblem of the Midland's hated rival, the London and North-Western.

Like a reporter assigned the obituary page, I gathered my envoical emotions together ahead of time to be ready for the loss: I recalled how I once tried to stretch a balloon around an air nozzle but was ordered to sit down before I found out whether it would inflate; and how, while my sister was occupied with a connect-the-dot book, I very stealthily stole her air and aimed it so that I could revel in a twin convergence; and how, pretending to study the stewardess-call button, I pointed my mother's, my sister's, and my own nozzles toward my sister and turned them all on full, so that the corner of her half-connected rabbit page flapped out of control. 
As soon as I was sure she was going to cry, I returned nonchalantly to The Family of Man, feigning interest in the shots of dust bowls and calloused hands, but in fact fixing in my mind the straining images of the childbirth sequence &dash. the incredible full-lipped ugly powerful arousing frown of the woman pushing amid the hospital sheets &dash. for it, along with a pen-and-ink drawing in a Dover book of Heinrich Kley's drawings, showing a tribal woman giving suck to a foot-and-a-half-tall baby elephant at each full breast, their squeezed mammalian yieldingness beautifully captured by repeatingly sinuous pen strokes, was my pornography between the ages of seven and nine. 
But despite hundreds of examples of <tag "510285">calculated</> meanness to my sister, on airplanes, on car rides, at dinner tables, she still loved me enough to invite me to her wedding; indeed, she wanted me to be one of the people who read a little biblical something at the ceremony; and it was only on the way to this wedding, holding my Bug, the product of my own marriage, up to the air vent above us and seeing how entranced she was by it, that my appreciation of it and the screws and the footrest and the tufted-cloud design on the wall that separated us from first-class passengers, and the portshades and the ashtrays, all returned; and I wondered for the first time whether the shape of the nozzle's inner cone was in fact more than decorative, whether it functioned aerodynamically to focus the outflow into a coherent column and allowed it to continue, even at the hissiest stage near shutoff, to offer a palpable incumbency of coolness &dash. unlike the gun-sprayers on garden hoses, which just before the flow of water was completely cut off created instead a Panamanian circular fan of mist on a plane perpendicular to the direction you were pointing the hose, so that you couldn't mist the

This is over 100 times more abundant than the fissile U235 which fuels conventional thermal reactors like the pressurized water reactor (PWR). 
However, some breeding takes place in thermal reactors, so the actual gain is that a fast reactor can generate about sixty times as much electricity as a thermal reactor from each tonne of uranium. 
Since fast reactors can breed from the depleted uranium in the spent fuel from thermal reactors, it can be <tag "510270">calculated</> that in FBR terms British stocks of depleted uranium are comparable to the country's coal reserves.

The advertising industry has not suggested its proposal should be the only method; there are clearly intangible values in the concept of quality television. 
However, what we sought to do was to create a mechanism whereby viewer response, both quantitatively and qualitatively, would provide the cornerstone of quality appraisal.

Not only was the company interested exclusively in cheap pictures for the local market, but also Dean had to go through the ignominious process of securing cast approval on his pictures from Solly Newman, the head of the company's UK subsidiary, whom he regarded as both `illiterate" and `over-shrewd where money was concerned." 
The relationship between American distributors and British producers was an unequal one, but when British studios started to make films that went down well in America, executives became optimistic that they could turn the new relationships formed with US companies in their favour, and brushed aside Maxwell's repeated warnings that `as their films were produced in a manner most acceptable to their own people, there was no reason why they should go outside for pictures." 
The first internationally successful British sound film was Rome Express from Gaumont-British, but its box-office performance was soon eclipsed by that of The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933), Alexander Korda's <tag "510285">calculated</> attempt on the international market.

The willingness of England to welcome foreigners into its communities, celebrated during wartime in the pleasantries of Tawny Pipit (1944), is thrown into question by the searing melodrama of Frieda (1947), where the `kindly, good-natured people" of Denfield become vicious xenophobes when the stranger amongst them is a blonde German girl. 
And the willingness of the British aristocracy to yield place without a show of force is thrown into serious doubt by the <tag "510285">calculated</> viciousness of Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), as the disowned son of a noble line works murderously through the family tree in order to claim his birthright.

If there is a prevailing thread in the history of these state-owned enterprises it is the constant under-assessment of risk &dash. of the lack of imported materials to supply a manufacturing process, of failure in the supply of inputs ranging from petrol to fertilizer, of farming communities not producing the cash crops to keep a processing plant in operation, and of failing to find competent management for complex operations.

Frank Dobson, Labour's energy spokesman, said last night that he would be demanding that the Government issue a White Paper disclosing all its advice on electricity pricing. 
Last week's announcement of the decision to pull nuclear power out of the privatisation meant that consumers could no longer be sure of the basis on which the Government had <tag "510270">calculated</> the industry's costs, he said.

The distinguished thespian wanders on, picks up the book and begins to read a letter from Wilfred Owen to Siegfried Sassoon or, perhaps, David Owen to Vidal Sassoon. 
Faced with an actor reading, as Alan Bates did for much of his one-man show at Edinburgh this year, you're tempted to conclude that he's a little under-rehearsed.

By 1948, in the same county, the proportion for secondary moderns had risen to three-quarters. 
Nevertheless, the gap remained wide. 
It was <tag "510270">calculated</> that 170 per cent more on books and other educational materials was spent on grammar than on secondary-modern pupils.

John Toshack, a little surprised by Real's vulnerability towards the end, spoke of questionable decisions and a tendency towards `strange results" at this stage of the season. 
Barcelona are only two points behind Real and, as long as they stay in contention for the Spanish championship, an obsession last satisfied under Terry Venables in 1985, the club will have no need to <tag "510270">calculate</> the cost of a pay-off.

Here was a challenge of some proportions, given that situationism was antagonistic to museum culture and indeed to the concept of `culture" per se.

For general information on the country see Bartholomew's Guide to Thailand. 
THE first words to greet our arrival at the Kibo Hotel in Tanzania on the south-east slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro were: `They brought a body off the mountain yesterday."

Mr Montezemolo and the World Cup organisers, Col 90, blamed 90 Tour for its incompetence and prices; 90 Tour blamed connivance between Col 90 and `unauthorised" operators, and a judge agreed with the company, demanding last week that Col 90 pay 90 Tour a token #1 million towards the luckless project's losses. 
The losses are on the roundabouts and the swings: outside the World Cup ambit, conventional upmarket tourism has tended to stay away this year &dash. hotel bookings are markedly down, with those anxious to see such sights as Masaccio's restored and unveiled frescoes in Florence apparently suffering from the idea that the Carmine Chapel will be a stage for the Chelsea Shed versus the Ajax Amsterdam Krazy Boys. 
All this is particularly ironic, because hoteliers had presumed that the World Cup would be a bonanza and have made improvements to their properties, spending what their federation <tag "510270">calculate</> to be #2 billion.

To the extent that arbitrary judgments are made in these respects, as they must be, the relation of market share to probability is becoming ever more tenuous. 
Also, whenever a manufacturer who can be actually identified is held solely liable to a particular plaintiff but no allowance is made in <tag "510270">calculating</> his market share, the latter will exceed his real share.

In this period, however, by far the largest occupational scheme was the independently organized Durham Miners Permanent Relief Society, originating in the 1860s, which by the 1890s had 140,000 contributing members and 4,000 pensions being paid out. 
All these advances were dwarfed by the step forward made with the introduction of a national state Old Age Pensions scheme in 1909 for all those over seventy on incomes of less than ten shillings weekly &dash. roughly a charwoman's wage. 
It could not be taken along with poor relief, and those with criminal records were excluded; it was only available at seventy, not sixty; and it was set at a very mean level, a mere five shillings, below the bare minimum which Seebohm Rowntree <tag "510270">calculated</> was then needed for subsistence.

There are tangible advantages to putting Holmes on the wireless &dash. it frees you from the tyranny of deerstalker and meerschaum, while giving you free rein with the violin (played to great effect by Alexander Balanescu in this case) and allowing a more determined dig at the literary roots. 
So in Coules' version &dash. dry in the nice sense of the word &dash. Watson is plucked from his customary obscurity as dullard foil to Holmes's wit and restored to his status as chronicler, if only for Holmes to complain ceaselessly about his appalling prose. 
The most noticeable thing about Merrison's Holmes, apart from a streak of jolly sarcasm, is that he is more self-consciously `a <tag "510270">calculating</> machine" than his rivals.

In the view of most Brussels officials, the alternative of making traders list every item bought and sold across borders would be intolerable and undermine the purpose of 1992, which is to make trading between EC countries as simple as possible. 
The Commission <tag "510270">calculates</>, moreover, that the job of cross-checking between the customs departments of each member state into the validity of traders' declarations would mean an exchange in electronic mail between them of about 20,000 million characters a year.
