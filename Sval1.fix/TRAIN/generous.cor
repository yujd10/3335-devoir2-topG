The bankers, and most other people, believed that it must be balanced mainly by reducing government expenditure &dash. `waste" as it was usually called, not by increasing taxation. 
They believed also that the gravest `waste" , crying out for reduction, was on unemployment relief, though the bankers, more <tag "512274">generous</> than the May committee, were prepared to have their confidence restored by a 10 per cent. cut instead of 20 per cent.

However, Brian Rout, a director of Throgmorton, said the first he heard of the Domeaction offer was when it came up on the screens in the City yesterday morning. 
The management offer is believed to involve ICH changing its domicile and floating a small percentage of its shares on Wall Street, where the group's Fulton Prebon operations have a strong reputation.

The overweight person, on the  other hand, is usually not so mindful of internal sensations as  a cue for eating or abstaining, and is less likely to take  exercise as an antidote to excess indulgence.

Then there is the singing of Adrienne Csengery, which combines lustrous sound with the acute responses of a great actor, or reader of poetry. 
When a song might consist of eight notes that carry as many words, it is crucial that she can shape the minutest inflections of musical and human meaning into a phrase that has the finish of a perfectly set gem. 
For those who had been at the Almeida Theatre on Monday, her unscheduled repeat performance here of the Attila Jozsef Fragments was a particular pleasure because it not only revisited past experiences but, in the more <tag "512277">generous</> acoustic, enlarged on them.

Tolkien, who as Rawlinson and Boswoth Professor of Anglo-Saxon was obliged to be a Fellow of Pembroke (the college to which the Professorship was attached), dreamed of becoming the Merton Professor of English Language, and of Lewis being freed from his disagreeable colleagues at Magdalen and becoming the Merton Professor of English Literature. 
`It would be marvellous to be both in the same college and shake off the dust of miserable Pembroke." 
Unquestionably, the bond which united them most deeply at this period was Lewis's spontaneously <tag "512277">generous</> and passionate admiration for The Lord of the Rings, the `sequel" that Tolkien was writing to The Hobbit.

The subdivision of the remaining, very large volume of the third storey of the main block into three further bedrooms and a bathroom was accomplished by installing new timber-framed partitions, cranked on plan, which thus provided built-in wardrobes for all the secondary bedrooms. 
From the second-floor landing, a ladder-like stair, more steeply raked than those serving the lower floors, leads up to a large loft, wholly accommodated in the roof space of the main block, which was not exploited as living accommodation in the original conversion scheme. 
Michael Manser sold Castle Mill soon after its conversion was complete and since that time it has had two further owners, the first of whom installed a lift linking the ground-floor entrance hall with the first-floor dining-room, the <tag "512275">generous</> volume of which has been somewhat reduced by the intrusion of the lift shaft into its south-west corner.

The input is most visible at Marks and Spencers' flagship store at Marble Arch, where men, women and children blessed with a keen eye can kit themselves out in a style that would pass muster in any fashionable circles. 
A Calvin Klein fan could put together a tan suede skirt, cream polo neck and man's knitted waistcoat to look just like the real thing.

Yes, the frustrated mother can't be <tag "512274">generous</> and so forth with her child, and on the whole I think the emphasis that people used to put on mothers staying at home was very misguided, because a mother who's having to sacrifice all her outside interests for the sake of her child is just a frustrated mother, and it's not good for the &ellip. also the problem is that you then have fairly energetic women devoting all they have to children, then they over-invest in the child's own achievements, so in fact you are putting a great psychological burden on the child because it has to grow up fulfilling expectations of an adult, which is not right for a child.

George Lansbury himself became one of the first reforming Poor Law Guardians in East London in the 1890s, and the social legislation of the Liberals, including the state Old Age Pension introduced in 1908, was a direct response to the rising political influence of the labour movement.

But it is as a scholar of Irish literature, ancient as well as modern, that Mercier will be best remembered. 
He was one of the first to understand the underlying role of ethnic religion in the Anglo-Irish tradition and to research the social background of nineteenth-century writing and in particular the influence of the evangelical revival on it, especially those writers like Shaw and Beckett who rejected religion in their personal lives but made its echoes, images and traditions part of their writing.

In the summer of 1918 there was a new wave of strikes, concerned less with wages than with questions of status: a strike by munition workers in Coventry against further `dilution" ; a strike by the London police for recognition of their union; strikes by the cotton workers against their humiliating dependence on their `rota" .

At the top of the bell the white canopy, meeting at a point, turned out again and cascaded back down the sides of the bell in innumerable white ribbons which were to be tacked down, in a series of <tag "512275">generous</> loops, and finally tied to each other at the bottom to form a scalloped border.   

800178
When Sir Peter Hall first offered me the part, I told him that Dustin had a terrible reputation and life was too short! 
But any member of the company would tell you how wonderful Dustin was &dash. he was funny and <tag "512274">generous</> to the extreme.

`In our view the only answer is non payment." 
OXFORD were grateful to Witney for turning out for a hastily arranged fixture on Friday night &dash. but they were in no mood to be <tag "512277">generous</> on the field.

But Mr Andrew Cant, a senior official, warned of a shortage of primary teachers in future. 
LOCAL education authorities are increasingly offering <tag "512309">generous</> packages of benefits in order to woo teachers to their areas. 

800181
There is no incentive to invest, to encourage young talent. 
Perhaps the simplest way out of the mire would be <tag "512309">generous</> tax concessions for, say, the next decade.   

800182
The travelling involved is certainly a heavy financial burden for the student and the new sponsorship deal has come as a great relief. 
`It really is a great and <tag "512309">generous</> boost and comes at a time when I am trying to step up a grade.

He was also a benefactor of City University, London, and helped set up its museum of construction materials. 
The report in Monday's Independent of the elections for vice-chairman of the Bar was less than <tag "512277">generous</> in its portrayal of democracy in the present-day profession. 

800184
`There are many other small building societies in this situation and I would say they are very vulnerable," said Richard Hatt, assistant general manager of the C &and. G. `Like the Guardian, they must be experiencing problems lending." 
Traditionally, the smaller societies have offered <tag "512309">generous</> rates to investors but have charged extra for home loans. 

800185
As a (continental) friend who had known him for the 42 years of his Geneva life put it: `Richard Ford epitomised all that was best in British life, civilisation and humaneness &dash. he was his country's ideal ambassador." 
Ford retired in 1970 but, in spite of a stroke, maintained his keen professional and personal interests up to the very last. 
AS A CLOSE friend of Tony Hewitt-Jones from our Oxford days, and as a former amateur musician and composer, writes Michael Graham-Dixon (further to the obituary by Lewis Foreman, 12 October), I was an early beneficiary of the warm encouragement, constructive criticism and <tag "512274">generous</> expenditure of his time which were to make him so inspiring a teacher and administrator. 

800186
The first European university to be founded &dash. that is to say, to be set up by a competent authority, endowed with a charter of privileges, and with the expectation of permanent corporate existence &dash. was the University of Naples in 1224. 
Its founder was the Emperor Frederick II and, in his grandiose way, he made many promises of advantages to both masters and students who came to his new university. 
He made these lavish promises not because he was doing something new, but to make up for lost time; he had to promise benefits on a <tag "512310">generous</> scale in order to succeed.   

800187
Leaving behind his ministerial executive car, Mr Lawson and his wife Therese journeyed to their constituency home in Stoney Stanton, Leicestershire, driving a Mini Metro &dash. outfoxing pressmen who had at least expected the unconquering hero to be contained in a Daimler. 
In his only public words of the day he was, as English manners require, more than <tag "512277">generous</> to his successor.  

800188
In later life he replied to a young girl who had sent him a manuscript: `Keep your manuscript for your sons and daughters, in order that they might derive consolation from it &dash. and not give a damn for what their teachers tell them or think of them." 
But many other German jews bear the traces of some of the more innocent aspects of Prussianism. 
I remember one summer my parents and Avram and I spent the week of my father's summer vacation (needless to say, he wasn't given very <tag "512310">generous</> vacations) at a hotel in the Catskills whose clientele was almost exclusively Yekky.

Also one of the ornamental grasses which the Germans are turning out in large quantities: this is a sheep's fescue, Festuca ovina, named Harz, 18in tall and covered in a haze of soft purple blossom. 
Most of Wickenden's trade is by mail order (catalogue for three first class stamps). 
He opens to the public at weekends only, but will, I fancy, have to be more <tag "512274">generous</> to visitors at some time in the future when the business is in top gear.

When folk offer constructive criticism or helpful advice you should accept it at face value, not go off with a sulky pout and vowing vengeance. 
SAGITTARIUS (Nov 23-Dec 21): Your <tag "512274">generous</>, supportive and considerate nature has you digging deep and forking out for a token or gift for a loved one or a pal or partner who's going through a rough patch. 

800191
Unlike Mr Ridley, Mr Walker did not provide a detailed breakdown of what the charges would have been for each authority if the poll tax had been in effect in the current financial year. 
Mr Walker described the settlement as `fair and <tag "512309">generous</>", with community charge payers having to meet only 15 per cent of the total cost of local authority spending in the Principality.   

800192
By the time, then, that he bunkered his second at the last, again 30 yards from the hole, he was well practised at the shot, and played it unerringly despite having one foot in the sand and the other on the bank of the bunker. 
Afterwards Faldo paid <tag "512277">generous</> tribute to his caddie, the diminutive and ruffled Andy Prodger, otherwise Prodge the Trudge.

Harry's imagination ranged over land and ocean to the sultanate of Brunei, which he had never visited in the flesh nor as much as seen pictured on television. 
Nevertheless he found he could visualise with perfect ease his <tag "512274">generous</>, cultivated host there, the very considerable library of which the latter was master and its inexhaustible, truly unheard-of scholarly importance.  

800194
We are the only organisation which operates safe houses to help them &dash. work which costs us nearly #2,000,000 a year. 
We rely on funds raised through Children's Society Week, and I would ask your readers to be especially <tag "512274">generous</> this year.

The seats are excellent too, with support where it's needed and basically good driving position, adjustable for height. 
Legroom is <tag "512275">generous</>, and headroom reasonably good.

Unfortunately, by the time he wrote it his name had been half forgotten. 
As a man Bottrall was expansive, humorously egocentric (he tended to oversell himself towards the end of his life), extremely <tag "512274">generous</> &dash. especially to other poets and writers &dash. and surely one of the best raconteurs of his time.   

800197
The classic example is Nescafe's sponsorship of the Independent Radio Network Chart Show. 
Nescafe decided to back the show when it was looking for a younger generation which had lost the brand habit. 
Nescafe negotiated front and back credits in the show's jingles with the IBA as well as a <tag "512310">generous</> measure of promotional mentions and the crucial spot ads during transmission.   

800198
He reiterated that Vietnamese boat people considered to be `economic migrants" must be sent back to Vietnam, but did not say when. 
He expressed hope that Britain's long-awaited scheme to grant some Hong Kong people the right to live in Britain would be `as <tag "512410">generous</> as possible".   

800199
The leaders of the party, although idealists and orators flourished among them, were perceived as sober statesmen dedicated to parliamentary procedures and seasoned by their years of experience within the wartime coalition. 
Most of them would be unlikely to sponsor a wholesale reconstruction of the educational system and were content to work strenuously within the <tag "512275">generous</> limits of the new Act of 1944.   

800200
It wanted work or maintenance as a national charge. 
Until that happy day (which did not dawn even under a Labour government), it pressed any claims for more <tag "512309">generous</> relief which came to hand and saw in Neville Chamberlain the principal enemy of humane practice.   

800201
I also met Lord Tryon, who is, I know, very proud of all his wife's achievements. 
De Beers were very <tag "512274">generous</> in their sponsorship of this ball.

Thus English officials are keen to pursue the French for importing professional players into the game. 
They are much less enthusiastic about investigating whether the small number of English players who went to South Africa received payment additional to their <tag "512309">generous</> spending allowance.   

800203
The 81p Pendragon share price is worth around 4p per Williams share, with five Pendragon shares allocated for every 100 Williams. 
Despite brisk two-way trades the price was `less than <tag "512309">generous</>", said Barclays de Zoete Wedd's motors analyst, Keith Williams.   

800204
`Despite his illness he was looking forward to recording another radio series this year," said Mr Michael Craig, a BBC producer and family friend. 
`He was a giant in comedy, a <tag "512274">generous</>, talented performer who was unique."   

800205
Eric sat down again, and in a very short time the Guild representatives were successful in getting what they wanted.

The cost per debtor would be #100 or the upper end of critics" estimates. 
Mr Kenneth Baker, the Education Secretary, said last night: `If Labour abolishes the loan scheme, they will be depriving over 200,000 students &dash. who presently receive no grant or a reduced grant &dash. access to considerable extra resources at attractive interest rates and on <tag "512277">generous</> repayment terms."   

800208
Mr. 
Waldron says the company should now offer generous redundancy terms. 
They have gone through privatization and ceased being Civil Servants and gone out into the cold and now they are suffering this blow, so they do, I think, deserve the most <tag "512309">generous</> possible treatment.   

800209
I don't know if it all came to Oxford, but certainly most of  it did, 
and {vocal sound="um"} the city council actually spent six  shillings and sixpence strewing the streets with flowers to  welcome her, which {vocal sound="um"} when we have a look at  the amount of money that was being, having to be raised  elsewhere it was quite <tag "512309">generous</> really. 

800210
The nan was particularly tasty (and very filling) and the vegetables and cheese blended perfectly to make a satisfying savoury side-dish. 
The rice was nicely cooked, but perhaps less unusual than we had expected. 
By now the <tag "512310">generous</> portions were taking their toll, but my partner insisted the call of the sweet trolley could not be ignored. 

800211
Mr Mandelson has vigorously denied the charge but the Joneses now await apprehensively for retribution when the Hartlepool dust settles. 
Mr Jones, a moderate, stuck to his guns to the bitter end, insisting amid mild booing from his Labour audience, that Hartlepool was not seeking `a Machiavellian prince steeped in power, privilege and patronage". 
Afterwards, <tag "512277">generous</> in defeat, he said: `Peter's got a good majority and that's all.   

800212
Why, I've taken pounds here all by myself, which is incredible, considering this isn't the wealthiest of communities." 
`Folk have been <tag "512274">generous</>," Nevil acknowledged softly Maggie spotted one of the girls from Templeton's and waved.   

800213
Only 4 per cent of those surveyed gave more than #30 a month, while 40 per cent gave #1 or less. 
The most <tag "512274">generous</> people were churchgoers from Northern Ireland, Scotland and the North of England. 

800214
Growth is slender, graceful and twiggy, and young leaves, stems and thorns are all reddish coloured when young. 
Plants flower almost continuously throughout summer, giving a particularly <tag "512310">generous</> display in late May and again in autumn. 

800215
Zola is known to have gathered information about all of these famous courtesans, and he must have realized that they, and others like them, were often regarded as astute, quick-witted women, capable of holding their own in conversation with men of education and culture. 
But this aspect of the courtisane myth, dear to the likes of Saint-Victor, did not capture Zola's imagination. 
On the contrary, in the notes he took on conversations with two friends, Edmond Laporte and Ludovic Hale&acute.vy, whom he quizzed about their extensive experience in the world of haute cocotterie, he tends to select details that underline the good-natured qualities of the women (they love the countryside, are <tag "512274">generous</> with the needy, not given to jealousy, indolent).   

800216
The Tottenham midfielder, who was not even an automatic choice when England flew to Sardinia for their opening group F matches, proved with his performance in last night's semi-final against West Germany that he is set to become a permanent fixture in the England line-up. 
Although he collected his second caution of the tournament and will miss Saturday's third-place play-off against Italy in Bari, Gascoigne showed enough skill, energy, vision and maturity in his contest with West German captain Lothar Matthaus to warrant equal billing. 
England manager Bobby Robson, often wary in the past of Gascoigne's lack of discipline on the pitch, was <tag "512274">generous</> with his praise afterwards.   

800217
If the SWCs find it uneconomic to raise capital through an equity issue and if debt finance is also difficult to obtain on reasonable terms then they may be forced to seek outside partners. 
The French water companies have already made several SWC acquisitions but the new vulnerability of their targets brought about by financing problems may make them less <tag "512274">generous</>.   

800218
Yesterday, Mr Ridley rejected the accusation of `significant maladministration" made by the commissioner, Sir Anthony Barrowclough. 
In spite of this, the Secretary of State told the House of Commons that `substantial payments" would be paid to the investors who had lost money as a result of the failure. 
The Government has been more <tag "512274">generous</> than had been expected and it has spread its largesse more widely.   

800219
Peace talks broke down after less than two hours as unions rejected a seasonal truce. 
Duncan Nichol, National Health Service chief executive, made what he described as a <tag "512274">generous</> offer to suspend hostilities over the holiday. 

800220
He seemed to agree with the prosecution that Bakker, who continues to protest his innocence, was a `100 per cent candidate for recidivism". 
Gabor, 68, almost managed to provoke a less fearsome judge in Beverly Hills to throw the book at her. 
Her friends eagerly testified that she was a kind, <tag "512274">generous</>, people-hugging, dog-loving, dedicated American, but to no avail. 

800221
Since he referred the matter to the Court of Appeal in January, the matter had been `entirely out of the hands of ministers" and in those of the police and the DPP. 
Edward McGrady (Down South, SDLP) urged the Home Secretary to make a `<tag "512277">generous</> gesture" and release Paul Hill who is being returned to Northern Ireland to continue serving a life sentence for murder.   

800222
Oxford v Cambridge is something people want to be associated with, and if you were to go to the market place that sort of figure would be replicated. 
Bowring have been very <tag "512274">generous</> but they are obviously reacting to market forces."   

800223
But in those tranquil Little Lea years before the great calamity befell them all, and before Jacks entered puberty, there were times of great happiness. 
The leisurely Irish quality of Albert's life is captured by one of his wheezes about a neighbouring peer who annually allowed a cricket match in his park. 
The luncheon provided on these occasions was so <tag "512310">generous</> that in the afternoon `there were few steady men on the field".   

800224
THOSE hoping for a reawakening of German cinema are likely to have come away from this year's Munich Film Fest slightly irritated with most current German offerings. 
The local press has opined that `the nadir is behind us", but few of the efforts I saw could begin to approach the New German Cinema of the Sixties and Seventies in intellectual depth, aesthetic flair and visceral power. 
Have <tag "512309">generous</> subsidies encouraged film-makers to pull in their claws? 

800225
He had to get to the bottom of every problem and would brook no prevarications. 
He was endearingly petulant and, with his impish brand of humour, a relentless tease. 
At bottom he was diffident, affectionate, lovable and intensely <tag "512274">generous</>.  

800226
The response, of course, was from Whale who told Michael that we'd all be in deep depression if we heard any more from him. 
On the <tag "512277">generous</> assumption that the callers are insomniac fans and not the studio staff heard laughing off camera, you wonder why they bother.   

800227
Internally, the existing building incorporated floors on seven levels because the floor levels of the Victorian extension did not ally with those of the original block. 
As the majority of the mill machinery remained &dash. waterwheel, axle, pit wheel, `wallower", power shaft and millstones &dash. and these components were chiefly situated in the lowest storey, Michael Manser decided to retain most of these items in a `set piece" display, reminding visitors of the mill's former function, and visible from the <tag "512275">generous</> entrance hall of the house through a glass door (Fig 56). 

800228
Some new measures had, of course, been necessary, but on the whole changes brought about by the war were less incisive than they had been in 1914. 
Not least, the absence of any serious rationing of consumer goods, and the large number of exemptions from military service for skilled workers and farmers made it appear that the regime was well in control of developments, did not fear a war on the 1914-18 scale, and was even rather <tag "512274">generous</> in its provisioning arrangements.  

800229
The government had made little attempt to build up reserve stocks, despite promptings from Sir Arthur Salter. 
Petrol rationing, on a <tag "512310">generous</> scale, was the only encroachment on civilian consumption.  

800230
If you now work through an imaginary game between Remorseful Prober and Tit for Tat, you'll find that runs of would-be mutual retaliation are promptly scotched. 
Most of the game is spent in mutual cooperation, with both players enjoying the consequent <tag "512277">generous</> score.   

800231
The terms were a triumph for Professor Smith who had confidently told City analysts that Rover would cost BAe `virtually nothing". 
The then European Commissioner for Competition, Peter Sutherland, immediately began an investigation into the <tag "512309">generous</> state aid on offer to BAe. 

800232
He added: `Over the past five years to the end of 1988 Pearl's rate of growth in total new annual premiums from UK individual life and pensions was less than one third of the industry average. 
`We remain convinced that the offer for your ordinary shares of 605p in cash is <tag "512309">generous</>, particularly bearing in mind the recent uncertainty in world stock markets.   

800233
Gradually the play becomes a list of experiences, rather sensationalist ones at that. 
Corrine Harris as the girl is often far too overwrought, but she does give her character a <tag "512310">generous</> energy and dignity.   

800234
Toleration implies the suppression or containment of an inclination or desire to persecute, harrass, harm or react in an unwelcome way to a person. 
But even this does not yet capture the essence of toleration. 
I do not tolerate the courageous, the <tag "512274">generous</> and the kind even if I am inclined to persecute them and restrain myself because I realize that my desires are entirely evil.   

800235
The non-provided schools, unless they were absorbed totally into the public system, had a choice of status. 
Some became voluntary aided, preserving a considerable measure of autonomy, receiving full support for all their annual running costs and a <tag "512309">generous</> subsidy (at first 50 per cent, but in later decades rising to 80 per cent) towards the capital costs of building.   

800236
Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all. 
But you will perhaps understand that there was a natural tendency on my part, in asking what was after all a <tag "512277">generous</> favour from my employer, to hint that there was a good professional motive behind my request.   

800237
But `Goodbye Russia" was about arrivals as well as departures. 
Once out of the USSR the exiles found themselves folded up in the formidable bureaucracy of West German reception camps and citizenship verification &dash. a bureaucracy conventionally grey in its apparatus but astonishingly <tag "512310?">generous</> in its ambitions.   

800238
The full range of moral emotions is comprehensible only because they attach to prima facie judgments. 
We admire courageous actions, are warmed by <tag "512277">generous</> ones, are repelled by ruthless acts, etc., regardless of whether or not they are justified overall.   

800239
Nothing pleased Mr Conroy more than to relate yet again the story of how he came to get such a beautiful tie and what a double-edged gift it was. 
It had been given to him, he said, by a very <tag "512274">generous</> lady, a rich lady whose baby he was godfather to.   

800240
But she looked down through the glass skylight and recognised in Maggie's cropped hair and long white body the same contours that she had seen in that other virgin warrior whom she had inspired into battle. 
This was a new Joan: another of these modern women with their new  language and new dreams who could follow where she had led, if she were <tag "512277">generous</> enough to let them fight their own battles.   

800241
Schemes will have to guarantee increases in benefits. 
But there is growing concern among industrialists and pensions experts that the proposals are too <tag "512309">generous</> to employees and will push up the costs of running a pension scheme.   

800243
In his original report he had proposed four names. 
Only two of them were western, but his editors had deleted his other suggestions: to name the star after Kali, the Hindu Goddess who is the destroyer of men and animals and yet is infinitely <tag "512274">generous</> and kind; or Indra, the verdic God of storms and war who uses a thunderbolt (comet)  to slay a serpent (dinosaur); or finally George, the Christian saint who slew the dragon.

Our yachts and their equipment are described on pages 14, 15. 
We're confident of our high maintenance standards, and guarantee <tag "512309">generous</> repayments if they're immobilised for a day or more.

In silence, Victoria Hamilton gazed across her children's heads, thinking about their future. 
The early summer sun streamed through the yellow Provenc&cedilla.al-print curtains of the kitchen and illuminated a room in which the only sound was the faint crunch of toast in their mouths. 
Unformed as their faces were, Sarah and Alex had the look of all her family, <tag "512275">generous</> and strong-boned, with thick, fair hair above a wide forehead.   

800246
And that's not all. 
The rest of the cooker is just as highly advanced: a fully automatic ignition and re-ignition system, a sophisticated but simple-to-use control panel, a high-powered, full-width grill, and a <tag "512275">generous</>, heat-zoned, circulating `Cycloheat" oven.   

800247
It is to find a strategy to win large-scale support on the government side for raising family income relative to childless taxpayers. 
A child benefit freeze has invariably followed a budget which has made <tag "512309">generous</> increases in the full range of personal tax allowances. 

800248
A man of great courage and a very devoted friend, he astonished many in his old age by the freshness of his curiosity and his readiness to experiment. 
The deference shown him at Birmingham University's Centre for Byzantine Studies, of which he was made an honorary member, brought him great pleasure, and was an appropriate reward to a meticulous scholar who in his long life gave <tag "512274">generous</> support and encouragement to young students (especially if they were Greek).

Sport and recreation clubs in Oxfordshire will be protected from large rate increases imposed under the Community Charge or Poll Tax. 
District councils have promised to give non-profit-making organisations <tag "512309">generous</> rate relief. 

800250
By scoring when he did he saved himself some considerable tension later on. 
The England manager paid Sunday's opponents some <tag "512277">generous</> compliments yesterday but it is impossible to escape the feeling that had Bobby Robson spent a whole night before the World Cup working out ideal opposition for the quarter-finals he would have dismissed the idea of a match against Cameroon as pure fantasy.   

800251
I had a wonderful time. 
All the local CCFers were more than <tag "512274">generous</> to me.   

800252
There was, for instance, the question of cost. 
For even taking into account my employer's <tag "512309">generous</> offer to `foot the bill for the gas", the costs of such a trip might still come to a surprising amount considering such matters as accommodation, meals, and any small snacks I might partake of on my way.   

800253
She was pleased now to see him so importantly at work, and immediately felt proud of him, regaining her vision of him as a distinguished man, how obviously superior, she felt, to Mark Strafford and those other drearies. 
Dora's capacity to forget and to live in the moment, while it more frequently landed her in grave trouble, made her also responsive without calculation to the returning glow of kindness. 
That she had no memory made her <tag "512277">generous</>.

She hit the ball firmly with great control, volleyed confidently and was always in command.

But to Jack, who had spent so much of his time in Janie Moore's squalid lodgings, the years since the war felt like the strugglings of a friendless pauper. 
`First, let me thank you from the bottom of my heart far the <tag "512274">generous</> support, extended over six years, which alone has enabled me to hang on like this.   

800256
Expanding waist lines should have dictated a stop but one look at the sweet menu decided us that in the best interest of the readers of the Taste Test we must carry on. 
Lemon sorbet, zabaglione, and cream caramel were just some of the temptations on offer but even better sounding were Monte Bianco and Tiramu Su. 
The Monte Bianco was a <tag "512310">generous</> helping of ice cream, {typo bad="merinque",good="meringue"}, glace chesnuts helped along with brandy while the Tiramu Su was a glass filled with a deliciously creamy combination revealing at the bottom biscuits soaked in Tia Maria and coffee. 

800257
It says the figure is half that number but seems to be ignoring Tigray, all of which is in rebel hands. 
The politics of this famine have made UN agencies and other governments nervous about taking public initiatives but if there is a <tag "512274">generous</> public response they will be encouraged to do more.

Even when a playwright has been drafted in, you can still see the joins. 
Patrick Edgeworth's Boswell For The Defence has a plot of sorts &dash. the barrister's defence of Mary Broad, an escapee from the penal colony at Sydney Cove &dash. but, in the end, the form defeats any narrative thrust. 
Unable to show his client or the Home Secretary or any of the other protagonists, Edgeworth is left with Boswell alone in his lodgings and is obliged to spin out the evening with the great man's reflections on extraneous matters &dash. principally the size of his member and a certain actress's `snow-white boobies of the most <tag "512275">generous</> proportions". 

800259
Equally broad is the range of real ales, food, and facilities. 
The Coffee Room offers the best espresso and fresh sandwiches in town, the hot dishes are <tag "512310">generous</> and inexpensive and the cold platters genuinely tempting. 

800260
We had contributions of 50 pence from little children, a few pounds from pensioners who remembered playing in the area as youngsters, and hundreds of pounds from some households. 
People gave what they could afford &dash. they all deserve a medal for being so <tag "512274">generous</>."

But the sunshine in Mr Major's vision may be felt, just, by the end of 1991, with inflation down to 5%, growth recovering and interest rates on the wane. 
In which case the member for Huntingdon could deliver a 1992 budget of <tag "512309">generous</> tax cuts and more spending, with the markets roaring at the prospect of another Tory triumph.

CANCER (June 22-July 23): You need to share your thoughts, plans, hopes and ambitions with a constructive comrade if only to get them straight in your own head. 
If your soft heart and <tag "512277">generous</> good humour have been exploited in the past you may decide to be more hard-headed in the future, but try not to tar everyone you meet with the same brush.

The Court of Appeal refused to cut the award made in February to Radojka Gojkovic, 49, in the Family Division of the High Court. 
Her lawyers believed it was highest settlement made in an English divorce court. 
Lord Justice Butler-Sloss said the award, #1m cash and a London maisonette valued at #295,000, was `not excessively <tag "512309">generous</>".   

800268
The cost of such a scheme is hard to estimate, since it depends on the size of the annual limit, and on the take-up. 
But the IFS estimate that the first-year cost is unlikely to be more than #1bn, even with a relatively <tag "512309">generous</> #10,000 limit, and could be much less.   

800269
The long-term solution to the ambulance dispute does not lie in nationwide reviews by a committee staffed from among the great and the good. 
Still less does it lie in automatic linkage to, say, the top quartile of average earnings of manual workers, on the lines of the rather <tag "512309">generous</> agreements accepted by firefighters and the police.

The 24-year-old forward is already on the representative ladder after only six games of rugby league, following his summer move to Simms Cross from Widnes rugby union club. 
Overseas opportunities closer to home exist in France, where jobs, accommodation and `<tag "512309">generous</> expenses" are on offer in delightful places like Carcassonne, Avignon and Cannes for players at the upper level of the BARLA ability range.

Present in the coach from Victoria Station to the village of Langham, Rutland is a handful of die-hard Warlockians, including a retired head of the BBC World Service Music department and a freelance musician responsible for composition of the Monty Python `Lumberjack" song. 
They tell me that Warlock himself was a vigorous champion of real ale ('Chemists's beer makes me puke and with anger I snort," he once complained), so our trip to Ruddles, a brewery which has been <tag "512274">generous</> in its sponsorship of this society, is partly out of deference for the composer's roistering delight in consumption of the Real Thing.

With the specific task of producing a class winner for the '92 race, Mike Pocock wanted to combine a powerful, easily managed upwind performer with a yacht which excelled on a reach. 
A <tag "512275">generous</> rig with a big, powerful main, counterbalanced by a waterballasted hull fitted with a cleanly shaped, non-bulbed, lead and iron keel, was the result.

The market works most efficiently when the potential investor's avarice is tempered by fear of an investment proving unwise. 
The decision to provide such a <tag "512410">generous</> safety net will do nothing to engender a healthy fear in the next generation of small investors.

The society claims, however, that recent votes show it has 3-1 support in the House of Lords and more in the Commons. 
HEALTH authorities look to be at risk of another round of bed closures, service cuts and deferred developments this winter, despite the fact that the year's financial settlement for the NHS originally looked <tag "512309">generous</>.

At Christchurch the university stood to welcome His  Majesty. 
" Well he doesn't bother to mention that the king also had an  official welcome at Carfax, which was the normal place, what  was known as the Penniless Bench, which was at the end of St  Martin's Church,  only the {inaudible seconds=1} of that remains at the moment,  now,

For any reforms to carry conviction, those psychiatrists who connived at the maltreatment of `patients" must lose their jobs and, in the more severe cases, face punishment. 
If the world association today insists on anything less, it will betray not only the many victims of perverted psychiatry, but also those reputable psychiatrists within the Soviet Union who are seizing the opportunities presented by the present political situation to press for proper professional standards. 
The temptation to appear <tag "512277">generous</>, by prematurely readmitting the Soviet association, would remove the sharpest spur to improvement which exists.

While an unusual player with virtuoso qualities that certainly justify YCAT's support, Scott did not emerge on Wednesday as a sure and mature phenomenon. 
The violinist Laurence Jackson chose to play one important sonata, the Faure No 1, and one virtuoso fragment, William Kroll's Banjo and Fiddle. 
This last, with its fast sharp-etched runs, its clear and resonant pizzicato strummings and its overt, <tag "512310">generous</>, singing chromatic lines and double stops in the middle, was performed as well as I have ever heard and even wrung a few cheers from a relentlessly non-committal, professional audience.

It's just as well that points are not awarded for a team's entertainment value.

There were large, unmistakeable signs that with The Child In Time McEwan had lost his desire to outrage. 
The lurching nausea his earlier stories taunted you into was replaced with the deep, sick shock of grief: the loss of a child. 
The book made large, <tag "512410">generous</> claims for life, and for itself: its beguiling charm made people reluctant to point out that what they had read was in fact a factitious marshalling of concerns that did not stand up too well to scrutiny.   

800291
So we now know how a big and profitable a business is for sale. 
But there is not yet enough information to put a price on it &dash. except perhaps to say that the shares will have to carry a <tag "512309">generous</> yield, say 8 per cent, if they are to be attractive.

Much has been made in the media of the low charge set by Wandsworth Council, leading people to believe that Wandsworth is a very low-spending borough. 
In fact, at #1,200 per head it is one of the highest spenders in the country and the low charge has been made possible only by a <tag "512309">generous</> government grant of about #600 per charge payer and payment from the `safety net" (to which Oxfordshire will contribute) of a further #116.

Much of the shrub bed is filled with plants given to her by friends: when she moved in she asked them each for one item from their garden.

Though Man of Straw is a fine achievement in itself, when the company frees that kind of imagination more, (and perhaps employs a writer), it will be a major force. 
As usual the Final Concert of the annual Chipping Norton Music Festival demonstrated amply the wealth of musical talent apparent in North Oxfordshire, ranging from young instrumentalists at the very outset of their training, to accomplished adult amateurs. 
From the <tag "512310">generous</> selection of `outstanding entries" picked from a week's busy music-making and presented at Saturday night's concert, the following must be mentioned: Sibford School band's imaginative Street Conversations, depicting a day in the life of a street; Peter Crowther's sensitive cello account of Faure's Apres un Reve; Chipping Norton Male Voice Choir's stunning version of Seventy-six Trombones from The Music Man; and Richard Dixon's sunny and exotic reading of Walton's Bagatelle No 2 for guitar.

And after a little pause she added, `It does look lovely; I'm happy to sit."

And she did. 
Another welcome visitor to 51 Milton Road was Cousin May, a distant relation of Susan Owen's. 
She had a tongue even racier than Miss Taylor's and such an abundance of <tag "512274">generous</> vitality that her annual visits were preceded by weeks of excited anticipation.

The bergenia is one of the best, clothing the ground in winter with bold, leathery leaves and producing rosy flower heads, anytime between February and April, depending on which variety you choose. 
First to flower is the cottage garden elephant's ears, Bergenia schmidtii, treasured since Victorian days for its early display of pink honey-scented flowers in <tag "512310">generous</> sprays about a mound of big paddle-shaped green leaves. 

800302
Finally, she warned the summit not to be obsessed with `graph paper economics" but to watch out for such unexpected political events as the Yom Kippur war or the Iran-Iraq conflict which could change the world economic outlook. 
President Bush's plan for a `capitalist international" to rescue the economies of Eastern Europe, laid out at the formal dinner of the heads of government last night, was given a cool reception yesterday by France and West Germany, who see the US approach as not <tag "512274">generous</> enough.

`Nowhere in its defence has Pearl produced any convincing evidence that it is able to reverse its long-term decline." 
Urging Pearl shareholders to accept its offer, Australian Mutual said: `This is a very <tag "512309">generous</> offer, bearing in mind that Pearl has grown at half the rate of the industry for the last 10 years and seen its market position fall from second place in 1977 to seventeenth place in 1988."

He considered that Tesco's proposed Marsh Bridge improvements would be a planning gain. 
After Tesco Stores and London Retail Investments &dash. which submitted the Tesco application for a greenfield site off the Wallingford Road &dash. offered to help fund major changes to Marsh Bridge to improve the difficult access to Didcot in the lower Broadway, Pembroke wrote to the district council and invited the planners to ask for `bigger and even more <tag "512310?">generous</> and worthwhile planning gains."   

800305
Even more depressing figures can be produced over the period 1969-78 where a different classification series showed the proportion of undergraduate applications through UCCA, coming from administrative and professional families, rose from 44 per cent of the total to 51 per cent, with a corresponding decline in the proportion coming from white-collar and blue-collar families. 
Thus, over 20 years, little progress has been made in widening access into UK universities even with the backing of a student-support system which, by any international comparison, has been a <tag "512309">generous</> one.

This was extremely annoying, but, of course, I had no choice but to hurry on upstairs.

V S Naipaul's A Turn in the South (Viking #14.95) is a patient, crafty account of a trip through America's Southern States. 
Slow reading reveals that Naipaul has pulled off a remarkable trick: a book which is unflinching in its damnation of slavery but <tag "512277">generous</> in its evocation of Southern charm and order.

If you had done so, the inappropriateness of someone of your age and standing addressing him as `William" should have been self-evident to you."

Beds have also closed at King's Lynn in Norfolk and in Manchester; Newcastle upon Tyne health authority has deferred a decision on whether to restrict services to deal with a #1.9m overspend, while Basingstoke and Southampton are among the districts facing significant overspends. 
The fresh round of closures comes after Kenneth Clarke, Secretary of State for Health, won what appeared to be the most <tag "512309">generous</> settlement for the NHS for some years last November.

Elizabeth Stevens, at Curtis Brown Ltd, Lewis's literary agents, has also been kind and helpful. 
I am greatly indebted to all those who, over the years, have shared their memories of C. S. Lewis with me, either as a friend, a teacher, or a figure on the horizon. 
In particular, I should thank Lady Dunbar of Hempriggs (ne&acute.e Maureen Moore) and her husband Leonard Blake for their <tag "512274">generous</> hospitality and the ready way in which they shared their memories with me; likewise Douglas Gresham.

I don't have the impression, though, that he does any work at all. 
He roams the world like the Flying Dutchman or the Duke of Windsor, except that he doesn't find the travel irksome, as they did. 
I conclude that he was made redundant on <tag "512309">generous</> terms some years ago.

The sheer volume of information was always going to bring presentational problems, although to be fair to the water industry its pathfinder is no more impenetrable than those of previous privatisations. 
A slimmed-down version of the prospectus will be sent to potential investors but the inaccessibility of the pathfinder serves only to support the view that the attraction of this issue will come from <tag "512309">generous</> pricing on the part of the Government rather than a thorough understanding of the prospects for the water businesses.   

800317
The texture was right, the tone was correct. 
He had to keep this manner, this pained narrative, so that any reader would feel that the account had been forced out of him with great reluctance, and that the sordid events he had yet to describe were softened by the compassion and <tag "512277">generous</> charity of the writer.   

800318
But the Government does not allow councils to borrow freely. 
Unless you decide to be unusually <tag "512274">generous</> when you set Cambridgeshire's borrowing limit, the county will need to raise poll tax by up to an extra #40 &dash. taking the grand total for my district to #426.

The garden is on sandy soil (those monks did not like damp chasubles), and in the accumulated rocks and rubble of the old buildings water simply disappears.

The pint has the right speed for a quietly sociable drink in a British pub, which is a habitat different from an art nouveau cafe in Belgium or a beer garden in Bavaria.
