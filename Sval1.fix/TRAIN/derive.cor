`This Christmas, time of peace and goodwill, you will buy a turkey that has had its beak tip burnt off with a hot wire" and so on. 
From a company describing itself as `the most revered supplier of meat <tag "515674">derived</> from livestock reared without the use of growth promoters or pre-emptive medication and according to special high welfare keeping conditons", this seems below the belt.

Their first album featured torrential acoustic guitar-work, and succeeded even in making the song `My Way" ('A Mi Manera') seem worth the bother again. 
On the recent Mosaique, they go further, lifting a few melodic phrases from the Arabic. 
But the thing to listen for is the propulsion they <tag "515647">derive</> from the handclap.

The possibility that there are duties which do not correspond to any rights is allowed by the definition of rights, and is generally acknowledged by legal and political theorists. 
Yet the view that such duties must ultimately <tag "515648">derive</> from fundamental rights or at least be based on the interests of people other than those subject to the duty has become sufficiently widespread that it is important to explain why it is rational to expect that there are fundamental moral duties which do not derive solely from the rights and interests of their potential beneficiaries, or which have no potential beneficiaries at all.

Such a horrific suggestion makes one realise that reconstruction of a past condition is only one possible treatment for historic sites, and it has its dangers. 
The awe and sense of time which an uncrowded visit to Stonhenge or Avebury offers, <tag "515648">derives</> from that very quality which exists at a site that has survived through millenia of historical change: a sense of slow decay yet also of survival.

The Bug's nostril had the innocent perfection of a Cheerio (and Cheerios were on my mind, since lately we had begun to offer them to her), a tiny dry clean salty ring, so small, with the odd but functional smallness of the tires on passenger planes, or of the smooth rim around the pistil of the brass pump head that you fitted over a tire's stem valve to inflate it to a pressure you preset with a crank on the air machine: at first, as the pump head and the stem valve failed to couple, there was a sharp, wasteful hissing, and the dinger tolled freely, but then you got the surfaces to seal and the air began to flow throatily in &dash. each slow decelerating ding now made the tire change shape slightly, as if it were swallowing, and the sound of the hiss was released into the tire, where the extra atmospheres gave it an unusual pent resonance (this was truer of car tires than bicycle tires), like the sounds strong dogs made as they strained at leashes, and familiar also from the transformation of the initial chesty sigh of balloon inflation into a space-age-upward-warping effect as the balloon's limit was reached, or the faint, high 
, sonar-like suffix of sound that the expensive kind of textured red rubber playground balls added to the prosaic bounce of extemal impact on concrete: inside, the shock waves flew around the ball (and the balloon and the tire) in unusually high-velocity polyhedrons, delighted by the readiness of their compressed medium to hum their rebounds and lengthen their term of reverberation. 
Air, the unparceled and seemingly infinite plenitude, available world wide, was focused and linearized by the air pump and brought to bear on a single task &dash. and so it was with my lovely Bug, who was able to inhale its transparent liters through a pair of miraculous one-sixteenth-inch portals and as a consequence to live and even to <tag "515647">derive</> amusement from a superball with a swirl in it.

The applicant's case was that in reaching its decision, the committee had acted unfairly in failing to inform the applicant of the case against him and to give him an opportunity to be heard. 
It was plain that in order to determine whether the decisions of a particular body could be reviewed judicially, it was not always sufficient to apply a single test. 
In many cases it would be enough to enquire whether the source of the powers of the body concerned was statutory or <tag "515648">derived</> from the prerogative.

No one in the area has seen another ditch like it, and I can only conclude that this stone-paved conduit was originally designed to take the run-off of rainwater from the cowshed and barn roofs. 
Perhaps if we can direct the sewage to a satisfactory destination of its own it will do so again; and if it does I shall be delighted, for huge satisfaction always <tag "515648">derives</> from bringing some long-defunct artefact back to life and use.

Being of ultimate, i.e. non-derivative, value is being intrinsically valuable, i.e. being valuable independently of one's instrumental value. 
Something is instrumentally valuable to the extent that it <tag "515647">derives</> its value from the value of its consequences, or from the value of the consequences it is likely to have, or from the value of the consequences it can be used to produce.

It's likely that they are the result of the impact of an  asteroid-sized body on the Moon, the actual point of impact being at the  centre of the inner mare basin, while the concentric ridges around it were  thrown up by the shock waves propagated by the impact. 
Alternatively, the concentric ridges may represent collapse features, where  the Moon's crust, weakened by fracture during the impact event, subsided  along concentric rings a short time later, as a result of the extrusion of  large volumes of basalt at the surface to form the central lava plain. 
The lava itself must have been originated deep down in the Moon, probably  in the lunar mantle, and it seems as though the scale of the impact was so  great that in effect a hole was blasted through the crust, enabling magma  <tag "515674">derived</> from the mantle to well out on the surface.

The existence of such benefits raises the question whether they should go in reduction of tort damages or be ignored as res inter alios acta, i.e. none of the defendant's business. 
The first alternative is based on the argument that damages are compensatory and should not exceed the plaintiff's net loss. 
Especially benefits from public funds are intended to fill needs, not to enrich the beneficiary, all the more so when the defendant would have contributed to the fund as much as the plaintiff and therefore cannot be accused of <tag "515647">deriving</> an unfair advantage from it.   

800031
The policy deliberately reversed the approach of successive governments in encouraging better care by reducing the incentive to doctors to lengthen patient lists.

Conversing with his friend Durtal, a writer, Des Hermies opens La&grave.-Bas with a criticism of naturalism's purely materialist perspective: it treats man, he says, as a creature of {deadGuys}. 
Since naturalism conceives of human impulses as <tag "515648">deriving</> exclusively from sensation and the flesh, mankind is closed off from any suprasensual experience, from the realm of dream and the spirit.

Although the Soviet navy is still afloat, most of the other post-second world war rationales upon which our military structure was built either have sunk or are listing badly in the water, swamped by a sea change wrought not only by time and technology but also by a new dynamism in international politics. 
These former dreadnoughts include the role once played by nuclear weapons, the short-war scenarios <tag "515647">derived</> from such nuclear dependence, and the strategies that call for the forward basing of troops which we have clung to since the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty, 40 years ago.

Visitors were shown up a narrow staircase, lined with pictures by Blake &dash. mainly illustrations to the Book ofJob and Paradise Lost.

But an analysis of the relations between separability and rights has to wait for an account of the intuitions about separability. 
Whatever our ultimate verdict, it is evident that at least Nozick's reason for erecting rights as side-constraints <tag "515648">derives</> from additional sources besides the doubts about comparability, if indeed these worried him at all.   

800037
I shall briefly discuss two cases purporting to show that some duties require non-instrumental justification, i.e. that their existence is of intrinsic, even if not necessarily of ultimate, value. 
They will also show that there are duties which do not <tag "515648">derive</> from anyone's rights.

Sir Geoffrey was replying to Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, who asked if it was `mere coincidence" that the average level of inflation for countries outside full membership of the European Monetary System was double that of those inside. 
`How much longer will businesses, mortgage holders and industry have to pay for the Prime Minister's lonely obsession of keeping Britain out of the EMS and keeping in her own hands the power to fiddle the economy for electoral purposes?" Mr Ashdown asked. 
Gareth Wardell (Lab, Gower) ventured that the majority of homeowners and industrialists would <tag "515647">derive</> some comfort from seeing Britain in the EMS `rather than the daily spectacle of the Chancellor clinging desperately to the rate of interest like a dead man clings to a live electric wire".

In many ways, it's the most radical BMW you can buy, with styling that, for the time being, bucks the house style, a chassis that refuses to oversteer and a facia that follows a trend instead of setting one.

There is a view, which I shall call the reciprocity thesis, that only members of `the same moral community" can have rights. 
This is narrowly interpreted when the same moral community is a community of interacting individuals whose obligations to each other are thought to <tag "515648">derive</> from a social contract or to represent the outcome of a fair bargaining process or if morality is conceived of in some other way as a system for the mutual advantage of all members of the community.

Thus is the status quo preserved. 
The nationalism of national liberation thus includes, for the minority of the national group involved, a paradox: a loyalty to the idea of the national group which is most intense, emotional and committed, to the point of sacrificing one's life, but which is also, on other criteria, quite shallow, apparently founded upon intellectually erroneous grounds. 
The paradox arises partly because the emotional force <tag "515648">derives</> from external oppression, not internal unities, but the external oppression seems to identify an internal essence, the junction point between what is imagined as a national group and personal integrity, self-respect.

The campaign has identified no fewer than 66 wide-ranging targets. 
Infra-red remote sensing of city-wide heat loss, promotion of car pooling, CFC extraction from scrapped fridges, phasing out the use of peat, reducing packaging, a commercial embargo of wildlife <tag "515674">derived</> products and a presumption against developments on sites of wildlife value are a few which give a flavour of a greener Leicester.

The side-walls of the train concourse were devoted almost entirely to Reiss's murals &ellip. and the end wall was covered with a world map and clock dials showing the hour differences in various time zones. 
Elsewhere on the walls there was a trim of Red Verona and various domestic gray and black marbles; the low vault of the ceiling was again done in orange and yellow plaster, and the floor was finished in red and tan terrazzo. 
Wood veneer finishes with aluminum trim characterised the lounges and offices: zebra wood, holly, and walnut in the men's lounge were arranged in abstract designs <tag "515647">derived</> from railroad locomotives, cars, and signals; panels of zebra and madrone wood covered the women's lounge; and gum, harewood, and holly were used in the offices along with cork flooring.

Most universities and polytechnics do not have sufficient resources to provide adequate facilities and support for disabled students, according to a Labour Party survey. 
Nearly all institutions believe extra help should come through further Government support, or a combination of such funding and students own disabled allowance.

Hess mistakenly thought that the oceanic crust consisted of altered  peridotite, the material of the mantle itself. 
It is now known, however,  that it is made up of basaltic rocks, <tag "515674">derived</> indirectly from peridotite,  and erupted by volcanic action along the ridge itself, building up the long  submarine mountain range and giving rise to the relatively few volcanoes  which poke their heads above sea level.

Brel's most famous work, `If You Go Away", is particularly ill served by Almond's treatment. 
He romps through the song as if it were some errant show tune being wrestled to the boards by Lloyd-Webber's wife, the lonely ache at its heart replaced by an overdone swoon of synthetic emotion. 
Too often throughout Jacques, Almond mistakes Brel's quiet fatalism for the absence of drama, and attempts to rectify the situation, punching up songs whose emotional power <tag "515648">derives</> from more subtle accretions of energy.

It was the weekend of the massive demonstration in observance of Human Rights Day, and the atmosphere inside the building (previously devoted to the use of the Soviet-Czechoslovakian Friendship Society and `probably bugged", I was loudly and cheerfully told) was at once relaxed, frantic, purposeful, and chaotic. 
`The relations between the people, the educational system, and culture are governed by the following principles: democracy; humaneness; love of truth; love of the homeland."

Towards the end of the last decade, a generation of innovative, treatment make-up bases in skin-flattering shades emerged, geared to covering the skin with an imperceptible film of colour while simultaneously hydrating and protecting it. 
For the cream of the 1990's treatment foundations, investigate Mary Cohr's Hydro-Protein Fluid Foundation and Bourjois' Teint Naturel Fluide. 
Both of these incorporate the anti-oxidant vitamin E, and vitamin A; in the case of Mary Cohr's Fluid Foundation, the vitamins are <tag "515674">derived</> from evening primrose oil, the principal ingredient in the Hydro-Proteine complex.

Nothing, public opinion polls show, is more resented than privileges for the few amid hardship for the masses. 
Why, asked Komsomolskaya Pravda the other day, for example, was the defence ministry building a country villa for one of its top brass at a cost of 674,000 roubles, `when the army can't find homes for thousands of officers and their families?" 
Much of Boris Yeltsin's appeal <tag "515648">derives</> from his tirades against `spepts-shops", `spets-clinics", and the like: `spets" being the Russian abbreviation for `spetsialny", as these establishments are coyly described.

National liberation invariably takes its form from the nature of the force oppressing those to be liberated. 
Thus, the traditional grounds for identifying genuine nationalisms are either <tag "515647 or 515672">derived</> from the oppressive context or established by the independent State (even if, in both cases, symbols are borrowed from the past, albeit transformed to modern purposes).

To suggest otherwise, to suggest that living in a tolerant society is good independently of its consequences, that it is intrinsically good is, in their opinion, to reject humanism, for it amounts to asserting the intrinsic value of something which is not human life or its quality. 
To understand why such misgivings are misplaced, and to show that humanism is compatible with holding some collective goods to be intrinsically valuable, we have to remind ourselves of, and to amplify, a few distinctions introduced in the previous chapter.

Locke aims to defend his view that all our ideas <tag "515648">derive</> from experience by consideration of cases such as `Space, Time, and Infinity, and some few others".

One informal estimate of how the House of Commons stands is 31 per cent in favour of research, 40 per cent against and 29 per cent undecided. 
Most of those against were <tag "515647">derived</> from voting figures five years ago on Enoch Powell's embryo Bill, before the most recent advances in medical science, which can help to determine the risks of bearing a genetically handicapped child.

Use of on-line order entry from the field (possibly by the customer personnel directly from their own premises) to reduce processing lags, thus allowing fewer regional warehouses while maintaining or improving average delivery times 
Analysis of data <tag "515647">derived</> from the operational system to develop tactical and strategic plans dealing with such matters as plant locations, capacity planning, make-or-buy decisions, and the cost savings from long-term sales contracts that stabilize production

But the Enquiry brandishes it in a rather more provocative way, as a weapon to banish unintelligible jargon and rectify confused reasoning about abstruse topics. 
If we suspect `that a philosophical term is employed without any meaning or idea (as is but too frequent) we need but enquire, from what impression is that supposed idea <tag "515647">derived</>?   

800081
Costs can grow rapidly with demands for finer granularity, greater timeliness, and increased accuracy of the data, especially if large volumes of data must be collected specifically for use in the model. 
Even in the case where the data are <tag "515647">derived</> from a transaction-fed database, significant costs can be incurred in selecting and processing the data to transform them into the form needed by the model.   

800082
Much will also depend on the timing of investments. 
`Our view is that the best guide to an investment manager's capability may be <tag "515672">derived</> from the past performance of UK funds under its management," says John Spiers of Best Investment Publishing.   

800083
Olivier was clearly born to act. 
From his Victorian-clergyman father he may have <tag "515647">derived</> his lust for language and his secret fury: from his mother, who died when he was 13, his clownish humour and feminine grace.   

800084
The farmers and farm labourers grow fewer in number. 
The efforts of the survivors, though prodigious enough, <tag "515648">derive</> less from the sweat of the brow than from thew exertions of the machines they direct from on high.

Madrid: 
Confidence <tag "515647">derived</> from Wall Street's gains took shares higher, with the index 0.85 up at 305.66.   

800086
Secondly, ideas are said to combine additively, like lengths or numbers, whereas impressions are said to mix, like colours. 
An important empiricist feature in Gassendi and Locke was the view that all our ideas are <tag "515647">derived</> from experience.   

800087
The matter was not, however, free from authority. 
In Law v National Greyhound Racing Club (1983) 1 WLR 1302, the Court of Appeal held that the authority of the stewards of the National Greyhound Racing Club to suspend a trainer's licence had been <tag "515672">derived</> wholly from a contract between him and the club and that the status of the stewards was that of a domestic tribunal.   

800088
The disease, which is caused by bacteria, is characterised by  spasmodic coughing, accompanied by sneezing and fever. 
Its common name is <tag "515673">derived</> from the `whoop" children make as they  desperately struggle to inhale after a coughing spasm.   

800089
Hot springs are one of the most characteristic features of areas of  recent volcanic activity, although they do also occur in other areas  less abundantly. 
They range in temperature from merely tepid to boiling, and they can  originate in two ways. 
They may be either <tag "515674">derived</> directly from a body  of magma deep below ground, or, more commonly, they may be `ordinary"  surface waters which have found their way underground and come into  contact with hot rocks.   

800090
It was a primitive sort of `pop-up" book. 
The horns of the beetle were strips of cardboard separate from the plate so that you could make them open and shut like pincers. 
From this early terror, Lewis <tag "515647">derived</> his violent distaste for insects.   

800091
His later development was to show many similarities between his mind and that of Yeats. 
Both were fascinated by historical cycles, archetypes and magical correspondences; both ignored the rationalist tradition of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. 
But Yeats's revelations were <tag "515647">derived</> from the `Great Memory" and Joyce's from the objective world.   

800092
John could hardly have found a better influence. 
John Piper had seen the Diaghilev Ballet in his twenties, had gone as often as possible because `the excitement &dash. the tinge of exultation &dash. in the dancing married to modern music and modern art, worked in my blood and bones." 
From that experience, he <tag "515647">derived</> an ideal of stage unity stemming from a close collaboration `regardless as far as possible of individual prestige and personality", which was reinforced by working in the Group Theatre of the thirties with Auden, Isherwood, Spender, Britten and others.  

800093
There is a danger that fathers will feel anxious about showing affection to their children (something they tend to do anyway since tenderness is not next to manliness) and that men may become even more self conscious than they already are about such activities as collecting the children from school or choosing a profession that involves working with young children, in a nursery school perhaps. 
Even mothers may feel inhibited about touching or <tag "515647">deriving</> sensual pleasure from watching their children grow out of chubby babyhood.   

800095
Places dedicated to film presentation, the penny gaffes, did start to spring up at the beginning of the new century, but it was only with the emergence of long films around 1910 that cinema acquired any sort of institutional presence in British towns. 
There is an extraordinary variety to the films produced in the early days of British cinema, showing the diversity of sources from which filmmakers drew their ideas. 
A film like Mary Jane's Mishap (1903), in which an uncouth maid who has been a little careless with the paraffin evaporates through the chimney, but returns in ghostly form to visit her grave, <tag "515647 or 515672">derives</> its fantasy elements from magic lantern shows, whereas The Big Swallow (1901), which shows camera and cameraman being swallowed up in a restless jaw, is more evidently a response to the medium's possibilities. 

800098
And what, in any case, did these radical critics of social change in fact propose to offer? 
They were (like Tawney and Webb before them) clear about the injustices and the distortions in the contemporary system, but what kind of programme could be <tag "515647">derived</> from their aching nostalgia for a working-class world that was slipping away?   

800099
Its approach is instrumental. 
One consents to the establishment of a political society and to its authority because of the benefits one will <tag "515647">derive</> from its existence.

Another, more general, prima facie argument will have to wait till later in the book. 
Even though deontological and teleological considerations are distinct they <tag "515648">derive</> from a common moral core.   

800101
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Grundig dominated the mass market in radio, television and the fledgling tape-recorder market. 
The man himself enjoyed a reputation as one of West Germany's most influential industrialists and the honours he received <tag "515648">derived</> from international recognition as an outstanding electronics engineer.

Mrs Lennox thought. 
What an awful business Outside in the street Maggie linked arms with Laura. 
They held each other close, <tag "515647">deriving</> comfort from one another, being sisters in a time of crisis.   

800103
One's friends can voluntarily control the distribution of the benefits of their friendship. 
The benefits I have in mind are the more diffuse ones <tag "515648">deriving</> from the general character of the society to which one belongs.   

800104
For something drier, try the 1989 Vermentino di Sardegna (Majestic Wine Warehouses, #2.99). 
Its nutty flavour is <tag "515647">derived</> from vermentino, the main white grape of Sardinia which has almond overtones.   

800105
In other words I would suggest that the principle is derivable from a morality which regards personal autonomy as an essential ingredient of the good life, and regards the principle of autonomy, which imposes duties on people to secure for all the conditions of autonomy, as one of the most important moral principles. 
To <tag "515672">derive</> the harm principle from the principle of autonomy one has to establish that autonomy-based duties never justify coercion where there is no harm.   

800106
The Psychogeographical Society of London took up and developed these ideas into practical programmes. 
While rejecting Surrealism's preoccupations with the unconscious, the SI drew on Surrealist ideas in devoloping their theories about urban behaviour. 
The two notions of opening oneself up to the peculiar emotional resonances of a locality, and the transforming of the mudane through the performance of an act on an object or environment, were developed in the theories of <tag "999997">Derive</> (drift) and Detournement (deflection).   

800107
A study of the congestion, or ground space per person, of urban areas can be expected to show a similar distribution pattern. 
The geometric mean GM is <tag "515671">derived</> from the GP.

By the late 1950s, the royalties from Shell ran at #250,000 a year. 
But in 1964, British-Borneo sold the royalty rights to Shell for #900,000. 
British-Borneo ceased to <tag "515647">derive</> a direct income from oil production and, instead, tapped the dividend flow from stakes in oil companies. 

800109
In ditches and damp springs, you may sometimes  notice that the water is discoloured to a strong shade of orange. 
This is caused  by `iron ochre", a generic term used to describe the iron-derived material which  blocks drains. 
Iron sulphides occur naturally in the form of mineral iron pyrites,  <tag "515674">derived</> from rock slate or else found in peat and marine deposits. 

800110
By unspoken agreement, they flaunted their relationship as publicly as they could. 
Richard <tag "515647">derived</> acute enjoyment from the storm of publicity which broke around their ears, the pack of paparazzi who attended them and the sanctimonious newspaper editorials trumpeting a further step towards the new, multi-cultural Britain.   

800111
On the physiological theory, as such, the poet passes no judgement, but the inference which depreciates the relationship of mother and child he cannot accept without undermining one of the bases of tragic emotion in his trilogy. 
Not only does the dramatic tension of the Choephori <tag "515648">derive</> from this relationship, but in the Agamemnon also interest is focused upon the relationship of Clytemnestra to her daughter Iphigeneia and upon the violation of a mother's rights.   

800112
SO FAR Umbrella '89 has looked more polished and more solidly assured than any of its previous seasons. 
Part of its adult look <tag "515648">derives</> from the strong presence of the French who are much better-funded than we and can afford to stage more ambitious work.   

800113
The company toyed with calling this, its third guaranteed equity fund, the General Election Fund since it safeguards investors from political uncertainty over the next few years. 
The fund will use futures and options &dash. sophisticated contracts <tag "515647">derived</> from shares &dash. to match the growth in the FT-SE 100 index, which comprises the market's 100 biggest companies, over three years from next January.

The Marquess of Blandford has been banned from driving for a year and fined after speeding and driving inconsiderately in his Porsche. 
Charles James Blandford of Blenheim Palace, Woodstock, admitted the offences when he appeared before the magistrates in Blandford, Dorset, the town from which he <tag "515673">derives</> his title.   

800115
Historically it may only have been a brief moment in Jewish Canadian history, but it was an important and passionate one, illuminated by the utopian hope of centuries. 
During the latter part of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth, the Jewish socialist movement was infused with new life by the work of Yiddish writers such as Sholom Aleichem, I.L. Peretz, and Sholom Asch, and it <tag "515647">derived</> further inspiration from the poetry of a number of working-class writers who had immigrated to the United States towards the end of the nineteenth century.   

800116
South of the Azores, but only about 100 to 150 kilometres from  the African coast are the Canary Islands, also volcanic, and also the scene  of recent eruptions. 
South and west of the Canaries, the Atlantic extends emptily for thousands  of kilometres, broken only by the Cape Verde Islands (also volcanic) and  two tiny specks of land, St Peter and St Paul's Rocks, which are not  strictly volcanic, oddly enough, but are composed of material that must  have been <tag "515674">derived</> from much deeper levels in the Earth than most volcanic  rocks.   

800117
Top of the list come anti-imperialism and anti-Americanism. 
Both <tag "515672">derive</> from a deep sense of grievance and resentment against those Western powers led by the United States which are seen to have carved up the world for their own convenience.   

800118
Some philosophical traditions emphasize self-creation. 
Sometimes this has been exaggerated into a doctrine of arbitrary self-creation based on the belief that all value <tag "515648">derives</> from choice which is itself not guided by value and is therefore free, i.e. arbitrary. 

800119
Its relations and feelings are also so clearly established, by performers of great precision as well as range, that dialogue becomes almost unnecessary, a look or a raised hand speaking alone. 
From a playwright celebrated for restraint and subtlety, Nekrosius's direction <tag "515647">derives</> enormous emotional power: it would be hard to imagine a fresher, more compelling treatment of Chekhov.

Closing date for entries is Monday, July 24. 
The name of an English First Division soccer ground is <tag "515673">derived</> from America's national pastime?

But supporters of the turtle project believe their plans for an eventual release of up to 100,000 members of the species Trionyx Gangeticus will go a long way towards cleaning up an unpleasant and embarrassing problem. 
The Ganges <tag "515647">derives</> its special status in Indian society not from its length -which at 1,500 miles is shorter than the Brahmaputra, the Indus and even the Danube &dash. but from legend.

What will be the payoff from making these improved decisions? 
Implementing an information system requires an investment from which future benefits are <tag "515647">derived</>.

`Sugar's clean bill of health" was one headline; `Sugar gets all-clear on disease" was another; a third read: `Sweet success as sugar gets clean bill of health". 
A fourth was equivocal: `Row as sugar is given clean bill of health". 
These stories were all <tag "515647">derived</> from a report on the Press Association wire service by food writer Don Philpott. 

800124
Blenheim Palace would not comment on a national newspaper report saying that Blandford was not in court because he was ill. 
The ban will be added to the 12-month disqualification he received on Wednesday, coincidentally, in the Dorset town of Blandford, from which he <tag "515673">derives</> his title.   

800125
The vote yesterday is expected to be confirmed by the full conference before it ends on Friday. 
The UK abstention was condemned by conservationists, who said that a stand should have been taken on ivory which they claimed was almost entirely <tag "515647">derived</> from poaching. 

800126
For many, having children does not have a money price because exchanging them for money, whether buying or selling, is inconsistent with a proper appreciation of the value of parenthood. 
In a way which calls for an explanation, both their rejection of the idea that having children has a price and their refusal even to contemplate such exchanges are part of their respect for parenthood, an expression of the very high value which they place on having children. 
Since the value of not exchanging children for money <tag "515648">derives</> from the value of having children it is misleading and distorting to say that of these two they value having children less.   

800127
His contacts in North America were not wasted, however. 
High-powered sports cars, designed by Jaguar and Porsche, for example, often use components <tag "515647">derived</> from the aerospace industry and Mr Goodridge was able to obtain such parts from the US and Canada for his growing band of European customers.   

800128
I know of no such arguments. 
The argument in the rest of the book (starting in Chapter 8) showing that all aspects of morality <tag "515648">derive</> from common sources refutes such a possibility.   

800129
The figure increased to one in four among students from manual working-class backgrounds. 
`Many will share my scepticism about the usefulness of evidence <tag "515647">derived</> from such surveys," Mr MacGregor said.   

800130
To accomplish this subversion is to create a text purged of mimetic dependence on female nature. 
The narrative structure of A Rebours, like that of Bouvard et Pe&acute.cuchet which it resembles and from which it may <tag "515648">derive</>, is discontinuous.   

800131
Some philosophical traditions emphasize self-creation. 
Sometimes this has been exaggerated into a doctrine of arbitrary self-creation based on the belief that all value derives from choice which is itself not guided by value and is therefore free, i.e. arbitrary. 
The views explained above neither <tag "515648">derive</> from nor support any such conception.

800133
A right-based morality is essentially a morality of rights and duties. 
Many moral views presuppose that there is more to morality than rights and duties and precepts which can be <tag "515672">derived</> from them.   

800134
Others, like Quasar Khan's inflatable zebra pattern armchair of 1968, remain unadulterated kitsch and enjoyable low-grade fun. 
But then, as Nigel Whiteley writes in the excellent illustrated catalogue that accompanies the show: `By the early 1970s there were two distinctive aesthetics for plastic, one <tag "515648">deriving</> from the Modernist principle of truth to materials and respecting the Modernist `less is more" aesthetic; the other a symptom of Pop sensibility which subverted principles and conventions of `good taste" in favour of impact and novelty."   

800135
Scholarship may come later to them, but when it comes, it has a surer foundation. 
It may be asked whether, since a grasp of general principles is what is evidently needed, and an ability to connect together ideas <tag "515647">derived</> from different disciplines, it would not be sensible to teach philosophy as a separate subject at school.   

800136
But just what is Degas remembering? 
He kept his private life so secret that we do not know if his brothel imagery <tag "515648">derives</> from first-hand personal experience or from fantasies fueled by viewing previous representations of brothel life, notably those of Constantin Guys, and by reading in the extensive prostitutional literature of the time. 

800137
Non-derivative rights are core rights. 
The relation between a derivative right and the core right (or any other right) from which it <tag "515672">derives</> is a justificatory one. 

800138
Where the fee is a flat percentage rate or a rate declining with increasing recovery, the lawyer intent on maximizing his profits could conclude that it would not pay him to invest more effort, when a knowledgeable client would be prepared to pay for extra time. 
Thus, there is much anecdotal evidence of a widespread practice to settle claims below value on a mass volume scale in the belief that the cost of further litigation to the lawyer would be disproportionate to any additional profit he might <tag "515647">derive</> from a larger jury award.   

800139
But how did Mt Katmai come to be demolished? 
It's thought that at the  time of the eruption a large volume of molten rock may have existed in a  magma chamber beneath the volcano, and that this was connected by some  kind of subterranean volcanic plumbing with the vents around Novarupta,  eight kilometres away, so that most of the material that was actually  erupted at these vents was <tag "515674">derived</> from beneath Katmai.   

800140
He was brilliant at invective, and making general statements about the need to communicate a politically responsible set of values, but neither he nor any of his friends were screenwriters, nor were they motivated to work with writers on ideas that were their own. 
Despite their rousing calls for a cinema that was `vital, illuminating," and their polemic against a national cinema divorced from contemporary realities, they turned to a series of novels set in the English provinces for material out or which to make their first movies. 
Nor did this brief fashion for working-class subjects <tag "515648">derive</> directly from their critical campaigns, except insofar as Richardson had directed Look Back in Anger on the stage in 1956, and that production marked the cultural watershed from which a fashion for `realism" seemed to flow. 

800141
He rejects Mr Lazaris as `an inconsistent and unstable politician, who did nothing for Lefkas when he was National Economy Minister". 
He says 50 per cent of the island's income <tag "515648">derives</> from tourism, which developed without control under Pasok, while vital needs, like a sewage system and improved water supply were neglected.   

800142
Their multiscreen projections of slides and film loops have featured in orbital parties, at the Astoria and Heaven, in Rifat Ozbek's 1988-89 fashion shows, and at Energy's recent Docklands all-dayer. 
From their residency at the Fridge during the first summer of love, Halo used slide and film projectors to throw up a collage of op-art patterns, film loops of dancers like E-Boy and Wumni, and unique fractals <tag "515672">derived</> from video feedback.

The former is raw and undigested, generally entering the MIS as transaction data.

Their lives had been a circular journey: no less than nine of them had spent their schooldays there. 
The frequently mistranslated motto of the Garter, Honi soit qui mal y pense, <tag "515648">derives</> from an incident at the ball to celebrate the capture of Calais when the Countess of Salisbury, either accidentally or otherwise, dropped a garter. 

800145
Having looked at one or two decidedly dodgy examples, we plucked up the courage to approach the one specialist dealer in Princesses, Don Kitchen in Lincolnshire, and became what can only be described as `proud owners". 
The Princess is a massive, long wheelbase limousine <tag "515672">derived</> from the standard Austin 4-litre, six-cylinder A135.   

800146
The rejection is there in Hobbes too; for him the basis of explanation is matter in motion. 
The picture of the universe as a mechanical affair of matter in motion did not originate, but rather was painted afresh, in the seventeenth century; it was <tag "515672">derived</> from the atomic theory of the ancient Greeks, Democritus and Epicurus.   

800147
The complete essence or form of a triangle is to be a three-sided plane figure. 
Nevertheless, even though having angles equal to two right angles is not part of a triangle's essence, it is because it is a three-sided plane figure that it has them. 
Properties of this sort were supposed to `flow", `<tag "515648">derive</>", or `emanate" from the form. 

800148
The closer they `zoom in" on an object the fainter it appears, and so they need to collect as much of the radio emissions from the object they are studying as possible. 
The concept of Merlin depends on astronomers being able to measure the minute differences in arrival time at the different telescopes of the signals from distant stars and galaxies. 
As the radiowave washes over the telescopes, they can compare its intensity and phase and can add and subtract the amplitudes of the wave to <tag "515647">derive</> more information than would be obtainable by one telescope alone.   

800149
LORD JUSTICE PURCHAS, also concurring, said that there was clearly a commercial advantage to both sides in reaching the April agreement. 
The modern approach to the question of consideration would be that where there were benefits <tag "515647">derived</> by each party to a contract of variation, even though one party did not suffer a detriment, that would not be fatal to establishing sufficient consideration to support the agreement. 

800150
He said Mr Wakeham should reconsider the arrangements for breaking up the industry, inherited from his predecessor Cecil Parkinson. 
The climbdown <tag "515648">derived</> from `the Prime Minister's twin obsession with privatisation and nuclear power".   

800151
These reflections on the mediating role of authoritative directives and of rules generally explain why they are reasons for actions. 
Ultimately, however, directives and rules <tag "515647">derive</> their force from the considerations which justify them.   

800152
Many argue that the embryo has a soul, and that the egg, once fertilised, is a person. 
The Medical Research Council, however, supports work on pre-embryos, which it defines as the fertilised egg and the group of cells <tag "515674">derived</> from it. 

800153
Which is a great pity, because if one cuts out all the Freudian claptrap, Abse has produced a brilliant character analysis of the Prime Minister, and of the whole Thatcher phenomenon, which succeeded in scaring the wits out of me. 
It is enough to attribute the rage with which she invests every issue to primal narcissism, the rage provoked by any threat of helplessness. 
We can observe that she is happy only when she is furious, and do not need to have it suggested that her earlier nickname of `Thatcher Milk-Snatcher" <tag "515648">derived</> from her own breast-deprivation, which denies her all happiness and allows her `only the sadistic triumphs of tawdry political and military victories."   

800154
Considering the simplest case that can be rhythmic, a minimum of three sedimentary layers &dash. light, medium and heavy; 1, 2, 3 &dash. can be permuted into six possible relationships. 
Experience, and tradition, teach that their orderly sequence is most readily understood and welcomed when sandwich effect is avoided. 
Reading from top to bottom, the series 1, 2, 3 is known as architectural form, an unfortunate and misleading phrase <tag "515673">derived</> from the bottom weighting of masonry, necessary to its stability.   

800155
For there is no mention of how capitalism or the consumer can play their proper roles in determining the future of genetic engineering. 
This is a serious omission, redolent of the old habits of thought that if only the public will trust Whitehall, all will be well. 
One of the first commercial products to <tag "515648">derive</> from this biotechnology is likely to be genetically engineered tomatoes.   

800156
This, indeed, was why he was there. 
Despising politicians, especially Tory politicians with experience of government, had been one of the easier intellectual habits of the Thatcher circle. 
It was from their disregard for the political class that both Young and Hoskyns <tag "515647">derived</> a fierce confidence that they would be more purposeful intermediaries for the recovery of Britain.   

800157
Although Lautrec's illustration does not stress, as does Michelet's text, the laundress's erotic allure, he was dealing with a theme that was `freighted with a sexual meaning for middle class viewers", who assumed lower-class women in general, and laundresses in particular, to be sexually free and available. 
The laundress was a familiar figure throughout Realist literature and art and as a visual image Lautrec's representation undoubtedly <tag "515648">derives</> from earlier, similar ones by Daumier, Degas, and Steinlen.

Biopol, created by ICI, is said to be the `world's first wholly bio-degradable plastic."

There is but one source for morality and for personal well-being. 
It is important not to go overboard and read the above as suggesting an inevitable identity of moral and personal concerns. 
All I argue for is that individuals inevitably <tag "515647">derive</> the goals by which they constitute their lives from the stock of social forms available to them, and the feasible variations on it.

All these points are supported in the exhibition by reference to various, much admired, historic, precedents. 
But how can these principles, clearly <tag "515647">derived</> from a contemplation of the past, be used to make a contemporary architecture that is not merely a self-conscious pastiche of old, but of its own age, looking forward with confidence while also looking back with understanding?

Senior sources at the Department of Employment believe that the parliamentary timetable will not allow for another tranche of union legislation before the election, due in 1992 at the latest. 
It is also thought that ministers are now aware that they have exhausted the political mileage to be <tag "515647">derived</> from `union bashing" and will be keen to soften their image by emphasising the Government's achievements in `employee participation".

There are really two economies, the state-controlled one based on the official rate of exchange of some three dollars to the dinar, and the new free-market one, based on the illicit, but tolerated, one of four dinars to the dollar. 
While those on fixed incomes continue to benefit from the subsidies on basic necessities they are bludgeoned by the ever-rising prices that <tag "515648">derive</> from the private sector, free-market imports.

What experience gives us is not knowledge itself, but the ideas which form the material basis for knowledge. 
This means that Locke has not only to substantiate the claim that all ideas are <tag "515647">derived</> from experience, but also to explain how it is that our reason gets from those ideas to certain items of knowledge which others said were innate.

IN THE 19th century, gynaecologist Robert Barnes declared: `Any disease occurring in a woman will almost certainly involve some modifications in the work of her sexual system". 
In her lively and original book, The Science of Woman, Ornella Moscucci explores the heated medical and scientific debates about the nature of `woman" as they took shape in the new medical speciality of gynaecology. 
Once new fields are delineated they come to be seen as natural, their boundaries appear to <tag "515648">derive</> from logic, and a world in which they had no place becomes unimaginable.

Indeed, the defendant's deep pocket is seen as a special target for retribution, especially when the plaintiff's injuries are great and the defendant's culpability demonstrable. 
The generality of the instruction the jury receives from the judge, the absence of any tariff or standards that might be <tag "515647">derived</> from prevailing practices as a guide, and the ambitious targets suggested by plaintiff's counsel,{fo id=169} are an open in vitation to respond in a spirit of generosity without much countervailing restraint.

There are ideas for libraries, colleges, and scientific societies. 
Finally, in the New Atlantis, there is a description of `Solomon's House", an elaborate institution of workshops, laboratories, and libraries, all dedicated to the systematic and collaborative pursuit of knowledge. 
Bacon's division of knowledge into Inspired Divinity and Philosophy is based on the idea that all knowledge is ultimately <tag "515647">derived</> from one or other of two sources: it may be `inspired by divine revelation", or it may arise from our senses of sight, touch, hearing, and the rest.

There is, however, no need to develop this point here. 
One may think that one's right to X always <tag "515648">derives</> from one's interest in X. If so then one's interest in having a right to X yields at best a right to have a right to X. It does not yield the right to X itself.

Following a recent trend, the exhibition organisers have commissioned the firm of architects Branson Coates to design the show. 
In an apparent attempt to compensate for the small quantity of work and its somewhat desultory disposition around the gallery, they have built massive wooden trestle tables in red and black and set at a jaunty angle, to support the pamphlets and models. 
In a gauche move to emulate the <tag "999997">Derive</>, they have laid pathways of adhesive tape to guide the unsuspecting viewer from one display to another: these pathways usually end by running up a wall or into a dead corner.

This wasn't always the case with Henry Threadgill's band, which proceeded in a more rarefied and deliberate way, at times close to modern conservatoire music, tiptoeing through delicate dissonance. 
Fred Hopkins's bass playing, however, continued to demonstrate that he remains one of the greatest practitioners of his instrument in the world, his playing a blend of secure, rock-like accompaniment and joyous, singing eloquence. 
At Ronnie Scott's, Red Rodney's band was surprisingly crisp and forthright-surprisingly because he might have been expected to coast on his legendary status in bebop and has instead associated himself with younger musicians who play originals <tag "515672">derived</> from bop, funk, Blakey-like soul jazz and Coltrane-inspired almost-free music.

This is how she manages, as The Golden Fly, to enter into palaces through open windows. 
This is how her sexual organ manages to detach itself from the body of a `bonne fille toujours," sacrificial scapegoat of the circulus, and to rise in triumph above its death-driven victims. 
The poison she brings with her, which causes the varnished surface of society to crack and decompose, may <tag "515647">derive</> its venom less from repressed libidinal instincts than it does from the ferment of representation itself, undermining natural reference, hystericizing its body, and infecting its vital circulus with a corrosive morbidity.

The latest Wedding and Home Survey shows that the average cost of a diamond engagement ring is #328 while the most expensive ring in the survey cost #4,800. 
When choosing a diamond there are four aspects to take into account &dash. carat weight, clarity, colour and cut. 
Carat weight determines the size of the diamond with the word carat being <tag "515673">derived</> from carob as carob seeds were traditionally used to weigh the stones.

It was blasted through this thickness of sandstone, and there is a well  preserved rim of ejected debris round the crater.

There was a long-standing tradition of professionalism, which centred around jockeys and pugilists for the most part. 
Sporting gentlemen of the pre-Victorian period saw no harm in making money through playing games so long as this was a matter of gambling; nor did they mind mixing with others of a lower class, who <tag "515647">derived</> the bulk of their income in this way, provided distinctions of birth were recognized and preserved.

The Nottinghamshire village of Cromwell stands  beside the meandering Trent.

As Richard was excited by the grand interplay of nations, and bored by social history in general, his tutor had asked him for an essay contrasting the supposed national characteristics of the colonial powers. 
`I think Montesquieu argued that the monarchy in France had barred the nobility from commerce, whereas in England the nobility were free to do business and so to plough the wealth they had originally <tag "515647">derived</> from the land into enterprises in the Empire," Richard's reply was fluent.

As she will be  maintaining all her twenty-six goals on a permanent basis,  the low sugar intake should help her considerably in getting  down to her final goal weight for the end of the year.

They were often designed by engineers, but what they lacked in architectural distinction, they gained in homely practicality and in the opportunities they afforded to local carpenters to display their skills in beautifully carved barge boarding and valances. 
Even the tiniest of flag stations (where passengers stopped the train by raising a flag or changing a signal) could bear the marks of the expertise of some unsung local craftsman.

But significant as this is, we should not place too much weight on it by taking it as a manifesto, a considered announcement of a developed empiricism of a theoretical sort. 
Unlike Locke, Bacon does not argue for some theoretical view that all of our knowledge ultimately <tag "515648">derives</> from experience; unlike him, he does not go in for showing how sensory interaction with the world is necessary for, and results in, ideas and knowledge.

The corridors form an intricate maze, infested with unlikely monsters which are nonetheless unnervingly lifelike, even if they resemble nothing on earth. 
I know a ten-year-old who runs to hide when the armed skeletons appear; and a grown computer journalist once described how he spilled coffee all over his machines after being startled by a giant pink worm which was chewing on his characters. 
The plot of the games is a jumble of nonsense, apparently <tag "515647">derived</> from the sub-Tolkien world of `dungeons and dragons", which was also the source for the way in which the characters, controlled by the player, can gain in cunning and strength as well as armour and possessions as the game continues.

The long tradition that regards consent as either the foundation or a foundation of legitimate authority displays two separate strands of thought.

One of the most useful aids that can be provided to decision makers is easy access to selective information in the form of summary reports, responses to ad hoc queries, exception reports, and graphical displays. 
Most of the needed information can be <tag "515647">derived</> from raw data in the organization's database; additional information might also be obtained from public sources, such as a proprietary econometric database.

In the wider sense of the political, the sense in which it encompasses all decisions by authoritative state organs, constitutional issues are, and should be, subject to change through the political process. 
The fact that the constitution affects the existence of the basic political culture, which is &dash. if a good at all  &dash. a collective good, is a prima facie reason for holding it to be a proper subject for political action, even though sometimes the only right political action is to take no action and to leave a certain area free from political interference.

The new examination will also be open to people who are already competent, but need formal qualifications to enhance their career prospects, and users of open learning materials (for example, from Linguaphone) for whom OIBEC would provide a focus. 
Interest in OIBEC has already been expressed worldwide; the nearness of 1992 and the Single European Market, and new markets in countries previously behind the Iron Curtain, are expected to increase demand for a such a qualification in the future.

The list of basic liberties is a matter of contention, but any list which is faithful to the Western liberal tradition will include widely diverse rights such as the right to be elected to parliament and the right to become a parent. 
Are both, when understood as core rights rather than as <tag "515672">derived</> from another more fundamental right, motivated by a common core, a concern for liberty understood in a unitary, coherent way?

The jelly-like blobs had dried out, leaving the mysterious black central specks, which immediately became recognisable as the seeds of the salvia. 
Those of the true clary, slightly larger, behave in the same way when moistened, and were inserted into eyes to absorb fluid or even specks of solid matter. 
It is thus understandable that the name clary was taken to be derived from `clear-eye", but in fact it <tag "515673">derives</> from the name by which Roman herbalists knew this plant &dash. the Latin Sclarea.

The right to walk on my hands is one instance of the general right to personal liberty. 
The right to personal liberty is the core right from which the other derives.

At one stage, Whitehall officials seriously considered stripping Vauxhall of its classification as a UK car company, so high was the imported content of `British-built" Vauxhalls. 
Since then local sourcing of components has improved markedly, as has the proportion of Vauxhall-Opel's UK sales which <tag "515648">derive</> from its UK car plants as opposed to those on the Continent.

The need to make films longer, in order to compete with American and French imports, also bred a more insidious form of dependence. 
For 15 years British filmmakers had experimented with the medium, developing film editing and camera effects to build suspense, and explore a world of magic and fantasy. 
Seen now, these early British films still have a feeling of freshness and spontaneity that <tag "515648">derives</> from the natural performances of non-actors, and a loose approach to framing which allows interesting material to get in at the edge of the picture.

Although the film concludes with a cheerful coda in which Havers ensures Nolte's future freedom, a feeling persists that the subject's tragic aspects have driven Milius into a self-conscious solemnity.

Examples are  iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and  magnesium. 
These are the inorganic elements in the diet, and  although they are only needed in tiny amounts, they have  very important functions. 
However, as with the vitamins,  you will find that a sound diet with plenty of protein from  various sources, good food <tag "515647">derived</> from cereals, fruits and  vegetables, should supply adequate minerals, with no need  to take supplements.

It was his active suspicion and even contempt for authority that allowed him to challenge the fundamental premises of classical physics.

Only if they secure the approval of the PLO, do the Israelis have any chance of staging the elections in the first place, and the idea behind the US proposal is to enable them to win effective PLO support for their plan, while preserving the fiction that they are still having nothing to do with a `terrorist" organisation which remains bent on Israel's `destruction". 
It is not for the Israelis to dictate who would represent him, Mr Arafat replied, but, in his counter-proposal, he made another gesture of goodwill: The delegation of `insiders" should be supplemented by `outsiders" of his choice. 
For however doughty supporters of the PLO the insiders might be, only outsiders would incontestably be seen to <tag "515647">derive</> their authority from Mr Arafat himself.
