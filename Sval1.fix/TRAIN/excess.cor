The money supply, as measured by M2, has risen sharply since November and rose by 22.4 per cent in January, the highest monthly increase since July 1983.

If the slim  person has eaten a really large meal, he or she will naturally  be very full and will perhaps not eat again until hunger really  returns; in addition this type of person might take a little  exercise to `work off" the food.

Property increased by 19 per cent a year in the four years up to last year, with average house prices increasing from around #24,000 in 1980 to #65,000 last year.

One way of evading restrictions was to find sinecure posts for good players; one man was given the job of checking the advertising posters for the club, though the most common trick was for club directors, who were often substantial employers, to find part-time or simply bogus jobs for which payment was made.

Perhaps most important of all, the enormous capital costs of nuclear power stations mean that, even at reduced levels of energy demand, nuclear power is not a viable option for the industrialising countries. 
Even a moderate expansion of nuclear power in Third World countries, as a substitute for coal-fired power stations, would cost in excess of $50 billion per year.

Great nineteenth-century operas quench these needs on every level, displaying the operatic art in all its full-blown glory. 
Go back two centuries to Monteverdi, when the first seeds of opera were sown, and the experience is altogether different: <tag "512404">excesses</> are stripped away, replaced by spareness and understatement.

What is more, all too many automobile owners fail to procure higher cover despite their exposure to liability in six and seven figures. 
What sanctions are there against an insurer turning down a settlement offer by the plaintiff within the insurance limits and thereby exposing his client, the insured, to personal liability on a later verdict in <tag "512402">excess</> of those limits? 

800081
This can be solved by wiring a {typo bad="reulator",good="regulator"} in series with the generator and battery. 
This restricts the battery's level of charge by converting the <tag "512405">excess</> power into heat. 

800082
It is a simple enough idea. 
The cars, powered by electric motors, tear around a circuit guided by a pin on the underside, which runs in a slot in the track. 
The speed of the car is determined by you and your hand-held controller, which must be deployed with some sensitivity if the car is not to be derailed through <tag "512405">excess</> speed.

As his work gained international recognition, environmentalists concerned about the destruction of the rain forest by settlers and ranchers lent support to his efforts. 
Environmental experts point to widespread burning of the forests as a key ingredient in the `greenhouse" effect &dash. global warming that results from <tag "512405">excess</> carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

AN AIRMAN from RAF Brize Norton has been banned from driving for 12 months. 
Robert Petherick, 21, admitted driving with <tag "512405">excess</> alcohol when he appeared before Aylesbury magistrates.   

800086
The beautiful Oriana exclaims `marriage is my thing and I'll stick to it" and a cat's cradle of intrigues and trickeries ensues. 
Alasdair Middleton's period production for Berma is wisely unfussy and he captures well the mood of uncynical good humour in this Paris-based frolic. 
It doesn't quite rise to the challenge of the rich character parts, but is a sound revival, stylistically on guard against the usual <tag "512403">excess</> of talcumed periwigs and sucked-in cheeks. 

800087
He based his character, Marie Cloporte, on La Goulue, and cast her as the epitome of depravity, a figure as contradictory as Salome&acute. in her combined repulsiveness and allure. 
In her crude language and `obscene" charm, she was the `icon" of `materialist <tag "512830">excess</>" and `grossness".

On charter flights skis and half a set of golf clubs can be carried free of charge in addition to your baggage allowance, unless otherwise stated. 
On scheduled flights sporting equipment may be carried as part of your baggage allowance. 
However, if this is in <tag "512402">excess</> of your allowance a charge will be made.

The court was told that 22-year-old Miranda Martin carried on driving after colliding with another car, and then crashed into a stone wall. 
She then reversed and went on her way, but came to a stop further up the road, and a member of the public took her keys away. 
Martin, of West Lane, Sparsholt, admitted driving with <tag "512405">excess</> alcohol when she appeared at Wantage on Wednesday. 

800090
Like a best-man's speech, Edward Petherbridge's The Eight O'Clock News is an anecdotal monologue, often rambling, occasionally funny and inevitably far too long. 
Offering us `the entire history of World Theatre", a kind of pop-up guide to the theatrical imagination, he artfully avoids dry chronology, beginning instead with the modern, virtuoso <tag "512404">excesses</> of Simon Callow, reaching Shakespeare through Jane Austen's observations of Edmund Kean, and the Greeks via puppetry.  

800091
But when you loved it, didn't you &ellip 
I mean I know I did when I was a young person first drinking {vocal sound="um"} I definitely had the feeling that if I was drinking to <tag "512408">excess</> I wasn't doing the right thing, whereas the impression we give in Oxford that drinking to the excess is perfectly acceptable behaviour.   

800092
He said that the relief would apply only to that part of the local poll tax which fell within settlement guidelines. 
The transitional relief will be calculated by comparing a notional poll tax level, based on assumed government spending, with this year's individual rates bills. 
If a council budgets to spend more than its settlement assumption and has to levy a higher poll tax, the <tag "512472">excess</> will be met by the individual payer &dash. over and above the #3 cap.   

800093
The overwhelming view in the market, moreover, is that the bull has plenty of energy left. 
On recent form the price will almost certainly exceed dollars 420 an ounce &dash. another rather silly round number &dash. and could well reach dollars 450, an even sillier round number. 
Allowing for the usual <tag "512405">excess</> enthusiasm displayed in such circumstances by gold bugs whose prime interest is a higher price, there do appear to good reasons for a sustained increase.   

800094
None the less, over 85 per cent of the population are covered by private medical insurance, though not all of these for long-term chronic illness. 
In addition to workers' compensation, a number of states require non-occupational disability insurance,{fo id=102} many have enacted no-fault automobile insurance, and federal legislation has experimented with several compensation plans for special injuries, notably black lung disease{fo id=103} and now vaccine injuries,{fo id=104} as well as making itself responsible for <tag "512409">excess</> insurance for nuclear accidents.

Saint Lydwine's physical suffering signifies her overcoming of the female organism; her gaping wounds are filled with the Divine Word; her disfiguration, in the very exorbitance of its violence, is contained in and by God's purpose. 
While the narrative of Lydwine's life connects castration and temporality in the, to Huysmans, satisfying mode of <tag "512830">excess</>, it simultaneously sublimates that narrative out of temporal sequentiality into a transcendent mode of symbolic repetition.

Rob Watson was a decent, straightforward man, so good-hearted that he had actually tried to pay money he was not obliged to. 
And yet Gower knew that the money was relatively unimportant to Rob, although he did not have <tag "512472">excess</> to splash around.

During the press briefing, however, Sir Donald Acheson, the Government's chief medical officer, intervened to draw reporters' attention to a specific paragraph in apparent contradiction to the government line. 
It shows how sugar, through obesity, may indeed contribute to several serious or life threatening conditions. 
The section reads: `Dietary sugars may contribute to the general <tag "512403">excess</> of food energy consumption responsible for the development of obesity.

Corruption and the mismanagement of the economy by the previous government are major issues. 
A number of people associated with the <tag "512404">excesses</> of the past have already fallen from grace.

What we do not know is how quickly the easing of growth will feed through into the current account. 
To what extent is the trade deficit a result of <tag "512405">excess</> demand and to what extent it is structural?   

800101
He admitted that this financial capacity would be provided by fewer underwriting members. 
Many professionals within the Lloyd's market welcome the current crop of departures as there is an <tag "512403">excess</> of financial capacity within the market at a time when business is not growing at the same rate as the available capacity.

A VAN driver was banned from the road for a year after a court heard that he was driving while still over the drink limit the day after a heavy drinking bout. 
Jobless Raymond Cook, 27, of Edinburgh Drive, Kidlington, was also ordered by Oxford magistrates to do 60 hours' community service after he had admitted driving with <tag "512405">excess</> alcohol.

It comes mainly from traffic and power stations. 
According to Friends of the Earth, one in five of the population is particularly at risk from <tag "512405">excess</> levels.

In that sense, it matters very much indeed. 
The deficit is a problem, firstly, because it is a symptom of <tag "512405">excess</> demand.

They found her deep within the kitchen, pretending that she had not heard the car's return.

What happens to share prices in the US inevitably affects prices in the UK. 
In addition, fund managers such as the big pension funds have a constant flow of cash from employee and employer contributions which has to be invested somewhere, and they are currently sitting on a pile of money on deposit. 
`The <tag "512407">excess</> of investible funds over the supply of securities looks set to remain for at least another financial year.

You might expect air conditioning, leather seats and at least a stereo when you pay over #50,000 for a car, but not if it's a Mercedes you're buying. 
Alloy wheels, anti-lock brakes, electrics for the hood, windows, mirrors and central locking are all standard, but you can spend many thousands on extras that ought to be included in the list price. 
Our car cost in <tag "512402">excess</> of #61,000.

The Mexico debt negotiations have been watched closely as any agreement would set a precedent for future debt agreements involving other countries, including Venezuela and the Philippines. 
In their first initial comment since talks began last week, negotiators said they had made substantial progress and were near agreement on options that would provide Mexico with `financial benefits" in <tag "512402">excess</> of $3 billion annually.

Raimi never quite decides whether to play it straight or go for camp laughs, although some major-league hamming from Neeson rather takes the decision out of his hands. 
Luckily, though, Darkman's daft narrative gives Raimi enough space to indulge his real talents &dash. cartoon action, smart sight gags and visual <tag "512830">excess</>.

Vitamins are present in the animal and plant sources of  protein we outlined earlier, in fruits, in vegetables, and in  some fats. 
Just a tiny quantity of each vitamin is necessary for  the health and growth of body cells. 
Too much of some  vitamins (notably A and D) can prove toxic: <tag "512405">excess</> vitamin A  or D can be difficult for the body to eliminate and therefore  can act as a poison.   

800113
Powell produced no novel for 12 years. 
Orwell, until driven to compose Animal Farm, confined himself to writing a diary. 
Though Sinclair seizes on the merits of a novel like Brideshead Revisited, it can surely be argued, as Waugh himself argued, that the book's <tag "512404">excesses</>, its clotted and opulent nostalgia, were the chief product of the Spam and Nissen Hut atmosphere in which it was composed.

Listen to `Kashmir", perhaps the Led Zeppelin song. 
It's big, but all muscle, without any <tag "512472">excess</>.

The Wrestling School claims to `propagate new methods and practices in the theatre through the work of Howard Barker". 
Sad to say, on the evidence of this lithe and ambitious production, it does little of the sort; nor does the audience here `surrender" itself to `a priest without convictions", as Barker would bid it to. 
Puzzling and fretting, not truly provoking, it indulges in an <tag "512403">excess</> of epistemological pretension.   

800116
As a guest he was ideal. 
He said the right things but not to <tag "512408">excess</>, he committed no gaffes and caused no embarrassment and he mixed with your other guests.

The first is the traditional perception, the second the one that is gaining ground fast. 
Each new piece of police <tag "512830">excess</>, each reported example of police harassment, each fresh scandal adds to the number of its converts. 

800118
The census of 1921 also tells us that the preponderance of women over men, which had long existed, was then at its height. 
Though the excess had been exaggerated by the death of three quarters of a million men in the war, the cause was mainly natural: more male babies were born, but still more died in infancy. 
The <tag "512472">excess</> of women &dash. a million and three quarters in all &dash. may have provided a practical incentive towards their `emancipation" , though it was rarely used as an argument.   

800119
Two Phillips &and. Drew analysts, for example, have just shown how Coloroll `created" its 1988-89 profits by writing off the goodwill on the Crowther carpet acquisition &dash. the very buy that broke its back. 
The same team shows that WPP, while crippling itself by debt, threw away its crutches by taking on so many small earn-outs (over 30) that it risks, on this count alone, a 150% increase in share capital &dash. with awful implications for dividends. 
In taking new-fangled ideas to such <tag "512408-x">excess</>, of course, WPP was by no means alone.

If you use only part of your agreed overdraft, you will pay interest only on the sum you have actually borrowed and not on the full amount agreed. 
Please remember, however, that if you exceed the agreed amount or overdraw your account without prior arrangement, you will automatically be charged a higher rate of interest on the <tag "512472">excess</> or on unauthorised amounts.

Wexford, who was hardly ever shaken from his equilibrium by the devious <tag "512404">excesses</> of criminals, was perpetually astonished by his own daughter.

Some such certainty about women's biological inferiority is a crucial fantasy motivating the essentialist plot. 
Structurally, this plot moves toward closure, revelation, the clarity of dramatic dualisms, and the purgation of desire. 
The prostitute in Parent is a seminal sewer, cleansing the city of <tag "512405">excess</> libido.

Staff in the area have since voted to step up their action by withdrawing emergency cover on New Year's Eve, the time of the year when the service is most stretched. 
While nationally the number of 999 calls over the Christmas period seemed to be down on last year and staff in nearly all areas provided cover, services are gearing up for the new year celebrations when <tag "512405">excess</> alcohol normally means a high number of road accidents and more public disorder. 

800124
If we divide the domestic economy into two sectors, public and private, then the deficit must correspond to a financial deficit by one or both of these sectors. 
In the UK at present, the public sector is in substantial budget surplus, (ie the <tag "512407">excess</> of tax receipts over government spending).   

800125
The film is about camaraderie and courage, of determination and the tough training the soldiers undergo. 
To protect itself and its reputation, the tight-knit unit (motto: `All for one, one for all") closes ranks after crossing the bounds of morally-acceptable behaviour. 
The film was based on a play written long before the onset of the intifada, though there have been many incidents of army <tag "512404">excesses</> during the uprising.

whereas a few years ago they were exporting to lots, they  are now exporting saw wood and ply wood. 
A big trade, probably the biggest imports of tropical ply  wood and saw wood come from Indonesia, as far as this  country's concerned anyway. 
Indonesia's policy in the past has been to clear and  resettle <tag "512405">excess</> population from Java, into the other,  into Sumatra and {inaudible seconds=1} town, the two  other islands bordering over Sumatra.

He had begun to drink heavily. 
Light was given nine months in prison for reckless driving and an additional three months for taking a vehicle without consent; plus four months for driving with <tag "512405">excess</> alcohol, to be served concurrently.

A moment's reflection will show the ineffectiveness of that. 
All-night parties, blaring music, and summer barbecue <tag "512404">excesses</>, for instance, are all strictly out-of-office-hours activities and that's when the monitoring has to be done.

He could not discuss the current alcohol content of gripe water because it was `confidential to the companies".

Because of the poor results, which left the share price 3p lower at 37p, Radamec shareholders will receive no interim dividend payment although borrowings have been reduced to their lowest for 12 months and are set to fall further into 1990. 
Chairman Len Whittaker said there were signs of improvement in Radamec's defence systems subsidiary and the company had recently won order and signed protocols for overseas business totalling in <tag "512402">excess</> of #3m.

In the past 15 years Denison's work has had a direct influence on the conservation movement in the North of England.

The rudder trim started at two thirds to the right and in level flight, with the power set at 24", manifold 2200 rpm, ended up a quarter to the left. 
The distance to fly was just over 500 nautical miles, which meant that with the published 75% cruise range of 780 nautical miles with reserves, we had more than two hours <tag "512405">excess</> endurance.

After a journey from Glasgow involving two faulty aeroplanes, an unscheduled visit to Brussels, and some hitchhiking, he missed the lunch planned in his honour. 
But his book, a half-million-word `Victorian" novel (reviewed below) had better luck. 
An American publisher, Ballantine, bought the book before the fair and sold the title on to the Literary Guild Book Club for `in <tag "512402">excess</> of dollars 100,000".

The consensus favoured his father's view that a British prince had no business meddling in international politics, let alone as the agent of an institution founded in Norway and based in New York. 
Richard responded to the assembled worthies with an <tag "512403">excess</> of charm which his mother knew was simply a tactical screen behind which his position was the more stubbornly entrenched.

The banks fought a rearguard action, and at one point talks seemed to be foundering on their insistence on benefiting from a rise in oil revenues, Mexico's major export. 
After a final round of talks at the weekend involving Mr Brady and Mexico's finance minister Mr Pedro Aspe, a compromise was reached giving the banks a 30 per cent share in <tag "512405">excess</> oil revenues after 1996, or a higher interest rate than 6.25 per cent.

If a regular source of swill is available nearby, pig-keeping can be profitable, but health regulations impose severe restrictions on swill feeding. 
The breeding, rearing, or fattening of beef cattle can be viable in the right conditions, although it is hard to make a profit on a very small scale.

Four grant bids totaling #280,000-plus &dash. to help with teacher information, difficult pupils, school attendance and teacher recruitment &dash. were turned down. 
Mrs Terry said it appeared only #341 was being provided per county school this year to cover extra assessment costs; this would drop to #134 next year, and the <tag "512405">excess</> cost would fall on the Poll Tax payer.

Many people have a heart attack, which can be fatal, without warning. 
Blood cells stick to the plaque, a clot forms, and blood flow to part of the heart is blocked. 
Blood cholesterol level is partly determined by diet: saturated fat, animal protein and <tag "512405">excess</> weight increase it; polyunsaturated fat, vegetable protein and bean, fruit and oat fibre lower it.   

800146
The immediate issue is not the plethora of forms which have to be filled in.

At Toronto North, a station open only from 1916 to 1930, an Italian Renaissance building was combined with a high clock-tower.

Not that the Calibra falls behind in all chassis dynamics. 
It grips better than the Corrado on the fast sweepers, but, on tight and bumpy lower-gear corners, the VW leaves the Calibra scrabbling to get a grip on the road surface. 
The Corrado also comes out on top for its firm and consistent braking &dash. the Calibra's pedal has an <tag "512403">excess</> of free travel before anything happens &dash. but the overly heavy servo action loses the VW some points.

To gauge how far he has succeeded, for three nights last week I compared the Nine O'Clock News with its rival on ITV, News at Ten, which pioneered the two-presenter format in Britain and stuck to it. 
In particular, I wanted to see whether the BBC's emphasis on analysis had led to an <tag "512403">excess</> of ponderousness, making the news less accessible, less comprehensive and less slick.

`We have sufficient growth and increased prosperity to spend far more on improving this than ever happened under the last Labour Government."

The commemoration of 1789 therefore sought to show that the Republic was the natural and legitimate heir of the great Revolution.

The land belonged to the people, he believed, not to a small handful of what he called `knickerbockered tycoons".

The 1975 Faulks Committee on Defamation recommended that the jury should be restricted to telling the judge whether damages should be `substantial, moderate, nominal or contemptuous". 
The drift of the Eye judgments demonstrates why this will probably be an unworkable second-best solution. 
It might avoid the worst <tag "512404">excesses</> but is no more likely than the present system to lead to justice in the particular case.

Torres, a former light-heavyweight champion and until recently New York State boxing commissioner, set out to repeat the trick with Fire and Fear (W H Allen, #3.50), one of two books inspired by Mike Tyson. 
Tyson is so completely the world heavyweight champion, so convincingly one of the most dramatic figures ever to inhabit professional boxing, that his <tag "512404">excesses</> are bound to be regarded as conclusive proof of something more potentially terminal than any hazards he is likely to encounter in the ring.

There has always been crossover at the borderlines between mainstream cinema and the sexual underground. 
Andy Warhol and Russ Meyer both turned the `stag film" into a kind of art form and Paul Schrader got explicit sexual concerns into the mainstream by canny, twisted routes. 
In Taxi Driver all the trouble comes from the final release of bottled-up sexual energy; in American Gigolo from an <tag "512403">excess</> of sexual expertise, where the orgasm &dash. as the peak of professional pride, as something bought and sold &dash. becomes the capital of American sexual congress.

`We only ever blush to the top of our clothes &dash. without clothes we probably wouldn't blush at all!"

Contrary to what Professor Winiecki has implied, they have significantly contributed to the development of an alternative economic model for the East European countries.

Indeed, the projected increases over thirty-five years from all sources &dash. about 43 per cent for methane and 70-110 per cent for nitrous oxide &dash. might turn out to be low if positive feedbacks and synergistic interactions (such as nitrogen fertilizing acting to suppress the methane soft sink) come into play.

At Vladivostok, the station which rose on Nicholas's foundation stone was a baleful prison-like building with two blocks linked by a single-storey entrance range. 
The plain, towerless strength of all the stations seemed to be a conscious representation of a powerful and economical practicality. 
There was nothing of the picturesque or civic <tag "512830">excess</> in these stations.

Also, in a dwindling number of conservative jurisdictions adhering to the traditional allocation of constitutional powers, the more drastic reforms, like the adoption of comparative fault, were carried out by legislation. 
For the most part, however, legislative intervention has been not to expand but to limit liability, to counteract the <tag "512404">excesses</> of judicial activism.

She felt she had found her own style in O Pioneers, a style as loose, as fluid, as unemphatic, as shifting as the fine earth of the endless prairies she wrote about. 
Later she came to depend more upon excision, upon the evocation of what she called `the thing not said"; castigating Balzac for delivering an <tag "512403">excess</> of information, she praised the hint, the pared-down suggestion.

The English-speaking whites were also hypocritical. 
They liked to blame the new laws on Afrikaner <tag "512404">excesses</>; but even before the apartheid government there was a deep white fear, as in the Deep South, against social mixing and mixed marriages; and the English-speaking opposition, the United Party, voted in favour of most of the apartheid bills.

He who had beavered away through the years with such diligence was obviously one of catholic interests. 
Battle, murder and sudden death were well represented (there were enough of the second to produce a Newgate Calendar in miniature), but with other such chef d'oeuvres as the sale of Oliver Cromwell's table (on which the Protector was said to have signed Charles I's death warrant), the Dangers of Traction Engines, a steam tricycle and, under a modest heading of `Military Disaffection," the story of a battalion of the Grenadier Guards refusing to parade as a protest against what was considered to be an <tag "512403">excess</> of parades.

He was already having to watch his weight. 
He could not be described as handsome, and, in later years, with his weight fluctuating to in <tag "512402">excess</> of fifteen stone through his appetite for junkish food between pictures, he showed signs of a middle-aged spread; not being tall, at five feet, nine inches, it tends to be obvious.

Already the Pentagon is drawing up plans for long-term containment, including the construction of training and recreational facilities for thousands of troops. 
Douglas Hurd has proposed the establishment of a Gulf Co-operation Council, with Western support, to contain Arab nationalism and Islamic fundamentalism. 
The costs of permanent military presence would be paid by Germany, Japan and oil-rich Arab allies, thus siphoning off <tag "512405">excess</> savings to finance the permanent, long-term external deficits which are likely to be experienced by the US and Britain. 

800221
The first reason is really the other side of the view already considered, namely, that a patient's express wish may be disregarded on the ground that he was not of sound mind. 
Here, this view becomes converted into the argument that the refusal of treatment may not have been a rational decision or may not appear to others to have been so. 
Thus the doctor will be persuaded to err on the side of caution and to disregard the expressed view of his patient; that is, just as earlier we noted the possibility of the patient's view being overridden by an <tag "512403">excess</> of zeal, now we see the same result produced by an excess of caution.   

800222
The time is probably not far off when manufacturers will be competing with each other to market goods and services on the basis of how `greenhouse friendly" they are, both in final performance of the product and in the process by which it was manufactured. 
Though there is no substitute for the consumer asking whether he or she really needs a particular product in the first place, there is no doubt that in the provision of essential products the role of anti-greenhouse-motivated consumerism can make a big impression in the fight against global warming. 
Recycling of paper and avoidance of <tag "512405">excess</> packaging and disposable products is necessary because paper and packaging can end up in landfills, where methane is generated.

Flying in the face of today's ubiquitous electronickery, the torbocharger uses nothing more than a simple spring-loaded wastegate to regulate boost, which is never allowed to build too high in deference to the engine's life expectancy.

CERTAIN misinformed gastronomic snobs persist in believing that you can't eat well in the United States.

Mr Lawson is right to argue that, given time, this desirable objective will be achieved. 
But if anything, the rate may already be too high, bringing with it the danger that it will not only remove <tag "512405">excess</> demand, but push the economy into recession.   

800233
Once you have turned the tap on nothing will stop the water coming out at the other end of the hosepipe in the form of price increase (my italics). 
Rees-Mogg `proved" the point by showing that during 1965-73 the growth of M3 (in excess of output growth) averaged 9.4 per cent per annum, exactly equal to the average inflation rate two years later, that is between 1967 and 1975. 
But a similar comparison for the early Thatcher years shows that, whereas the average rate of growth of M3 (in <tag "512402">excess</> of output growth) was about 14 per cent in the four years ending 1983, the average inflation rate was only about 6 per cent in the four years ending 1985.

But there is no god-given identity between the two, the linkages being wholly determined by the nature of the harness the financial system. 
It is a rough and ready analogy, of which doubtless Keynes and Keynesians might disapprove, but it serves an important illustrative purpose.

All of these are projects in which the government holds a controlling interest and in which it has a strong commercial partner.

For Surrey it must seem a far cry from the urban decay of Kennington. 
The Surrey bowlers were no doubt scoring themselves pretty high on the deprivation scale yesterday morning when that dedicated follower of fashion, Ian Greig, invited the home side to take first strike on a wicket that had yielded three totals in <tag "512402">excess</> of 450 in the last week.

Since then the unpopularity of the council has grown, judging by a byelection in February which saw Labour lose a seat with an 18.3 per cent swing to the Tories. 
In such circumstances, Mr Livingstone, for all his <tag "512404">excesses</>, may be a better bet than Ms Spray &dash. a relatively inexperienced member of highly unpopular council.

800244
What sanctions are there against an insurer turning down a settlement offer by the plaintiff within the insurance limits and thereby exposing his client, the insured, to personal liability on a later verdict in excess of those limits? 
The likelihood of abuse is of course controlled in the first instance by the strong incentive for insurers to settle whenever the likely recovery and the cost of trial exceed the policy limits. 
Beyond that, the conventional answer, still adhered to in many states,{fo id=133} has been to make the insurer liable for the <tag "512409">excess</> only on proof of malicious refusal to settle in violation of his implied covenant of good faith.

To say that the military training provided by the UK to the two non-communist resistance (NCR) factions grouped with the Khmer Rouge in the coalition government of Democratic Kampuchea is equivalent to UK support of the Khmer Rouge is a sensationalistic simplification worthy only of the tabloids. 
It is analogous to arguing that countries like Britain that fought beside the Soviet Union in the alliance against Nazi Germany in doing so approved of and furthered the <tag "512404">excesses</> of Stalin.

Retired postman Norman Hoare found a ticket on his windscreen when he returned to his car after leaving it in the Rye Farm parking area close to the riverside meadows in Abingdon on June 8. 
The notice had been issued because of his failure to display a valid ticket, informing him that as a result, there was a #15 <tag "512409">excess</> charge to pay.

The exhibits are imaginatively presented. 
`Food poisoning", for instance, shows the effect of the 44,000 cases of the `runs" reported this year with a cartoon strip depicting bacteria like so many vengeful Smurfs. 
The display on consumption utilises the age-old trick of piling up an adult's average monthly intake of food (enormous amounts of chocolate) and invites the visitor to burn off <tag "512405">excess</> calories on an `Energy Bike" (it does, of course, take a depressingly long time to nullify the effect of just one grape).   

800251
We haven't had that sort of figure very often before. 
The national figure seems to be, the national figure of food poisoning cases this year looks like being in <tag "512402">excess</> of sixty thousand. {vocal sound="um"} it was around fifty-four thousand last year, and the figure's just going up and up.   

800252
Job injuries have mostly retained the historical link with workers' compensation in providing income-related benefits, though subject to `caps". 
Since tort damages would be reduced by these benefits, resort to tort recovery by the victim is largely discouraged except in cases of severe injury when it might be worth his while to pursue damages for non-economic loss or, in the case of high income earners, for the <tag "512405">excess</> income loss.

Such an increased return of blood is monitored by receptors that signal the amount of filling of the heart. 
These receptors wrongly interpret the increased return of blood when lying down as a sign that <tag "512405">excess</> blood volume has caused the blood vessels to become `overfull" and so the kidney is instructed to remove the excess water and salts.

One that quite eclipsed the vote of thanks from Michael Heseltine and the presence of such luminaries as Margaret Drabble on the guest list. 
Although his audience was smaller than expected (a rail strike day), under the gaze of the now obligatory TV cameras in the lofty marble halls of the RIBA Max savaged the post-Modernists and the revivalists in a manner reminiscent of the worst <tag "512404">excesses</> of the French Revolution.

The cacophony spun out of control as the crowds swelled through the amusement park in the countryside on the outskirts of Baltimore. 
The summer night was hot and nearly everywhere faces and necks were drenched with sweat, except for those screaming as they plunged over the crests of a roller coaster, or shrieking as they plummeted down the narrow, twisting gullies of racing water in torpedo sleds. 
The garishly coloured, manically blinking lights along the central gangway were joined by the grating sounds of emphatic music metallically erupting out of an <tag "512403">excess</> of loudspeakers &dash. calliopes presto, marches prestissimo.

An explanation is required of my reported comment (9 December) that Sir Winston Churchill would not like what is going on today in Parliament. 
Such displeasure does not derive from the increase in pensions for war widows, although it may perhaps apply to the long delay in this being granted, but rather to the abandonment by increasing numbers among all the main parties of Parliament's prime constitutional role of keeping a check upon the Executive. 
The growing reticence of Conservative Members to incur the wrath of the Whips by seeking constructively to criticise Government proposals, the use by the main Opposition of Parliament as a mere platform from which to fight the next general election, and the degeneration of the SLD/SDP into the obscurity of community politics effectively destroys the climate necessary for good government and denies to the people from one election to another all protection against Executive <tag "512830">excess</>.

Perhaps most important of all, the enormous capital costs of nuclear power stations mean that, even at reduced levels of energy demand, nuclear power is not a viable option for the industrialising countries. 
Even a moderate expansion of nuclear power in Third World countries, as a substitute for coal-fired power stations, would cost in <tag "512402">excess</> of $50 billion per year.

Just as in the bad old days, the public has had to rely on foreign radio for news. 
Everything began on 13 October, when Soviet media leaders were summoned to a session with Mr Gorbachev to hear a quite unexpected lecture on their alleged <tag "512404">excesses</>.

Almost as frightening was the bellow of Buddie's voice when it grew huge and powerful with anger, and the shouted words that struck like blows to make Frankie flinch and tremble. 
His own imagination offered a punishment far in <tag "512402">excess</> of his crime.

Only 4 per cent of the 7.5 per cent package for teachers' pay was included in the July announcement. 
No provision was made for the <tag "512405">excess</> cost of collecting the poll tax instead of rates (about #200m) or for the fact that council house rent payers will not in future be able to subsidise ratepayers ( #171m).

Light was also disqualified from driving for six months, fined #5, and ordered to pay #40 compensation to the owner of the ski jacket. 
Michael Schofield, 18, of Evenlode Drive, Berinsfield, admitted eight charges of theft, using a motor vehicle without insurance and driving a motor vehicle on a restricted road in <tag "512402">excess</> of 30mph.

The jury's award would only be interfered with on appeal if it was so large or so small as to be irrational. 
Taking account of all material considerations and assuming everything in Mrs Sutcliffe's favour, the amount of the award was very substantially in <tag "512402">excess</> of any sum which could reasonably have been thought appropriate to compensate her.

Flexner, a historian, does not belong to what Virginia Woolf called the picturesque school of biography. 
Rather, she is a scholar who is primarily interested in tracing the development of Wollstonecraft's thought, and of showing how she was both of her time, and beyond it. 
Flexner does not seem quite at ease &dash. and who can blame her &dash. with the contradictions, <tag "512404">excesses</> and ambiguities of her subject.
