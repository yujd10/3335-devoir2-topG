It seems a very British way of handling differences of class and race.

When the big day comes, when we <tag "511216">invade</> Europe, the battle is going to be won on the beaches.   

800008
Like so much else in Lebanon, it was physically possible but we never met anyone who had actually achieved this. 
In reality, the story of Lebanon was one of both implosion and explosion, of internal conflict and external pressure, but its tragedy &dash. its history &dash. was one of constantly invading armies, negotiating, cajoling, intimidating, storming their way into Beirut. 
Lebanon was easy to <tag "511216">invade</>. 

800009
And, second, the coercer aims at and succeeds in forcing others by restricting their options. 
All coercion invades autonomy by subjecting the will of the coerced. 
Coercive threats which create a choice dictated by personal needs, and most serious cases of coercion by the state are of this kind, also <tag "511342">invade</> autonomy by offending against that aspect which concerns the quality of options.   

800010
The SPD hold their annual party conference next week. 
This is the party that, under Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik, pioneered the development of inter-German relations and some party policy makers are concerned that Chancellor Kohl has, with his 10-point plan for German `confederation", <tag "511340-x">invaded</> what is traditionally SPD turf.   

800011
You will also need to curb its inexorable sideways spread, smothering the flower borders you had planted under its once-manageable feet. 
A Leyland cypress is the most boring plant ever to have <tag "511340 or 511343">invaded</> a garden centre.

He persuaded Marshall to accompany him to Algiers. 
Marshall found even the American generals there eager to <tag "511216">invade</> Italy.

Another is Gen. Jaruzelski, who, despite stilted relations with the Vatican has sought such relations. 
One of the first vexed issues to be debated between Poland and the Vatican could be the present row over the Carmelite nuns" convent at the Auschwitz concentration camp. 
A Jewish protest grouplast week <tag "511340">invaded</> the convent &dash. wearing concentration camp uniforms &dash. and demanded that the nuns leave what it says is a Jewish memorial site.   

800014
Boyd and Lorberbaum showed that a population of Tit for Tat could be invaded, evolutionarily speaking, by a mixture of Tit for Two Tats and Suspicious Tit for Tat, the two prospering in each other's company. 
This combination is almost certainly not the only combination that could invade in this kind of way. 
There are probably lots of mixtures of slightly nasty strategies with nice and very forgiving strategies that are together capable of <tag "511342-x?">invading</>.

It plays with Godard's Une Femme est une Femme, made the following year, both graceful and romantic tributes to the MGM musical comedy, and to their vibrant stars, Anouk Amiee and Anna Karina. 
Asterix, whose village was the last in Gaul to resist the <tag "518924">invading</> Romans, was conceived in the Fifties with, no doubt, the Occupation still fresh in memory.

Neither, it was clear, could strike a quick final blow against the other. 
The Germans could not <tag "511216">invade</> Great Britain. 

800017
`The only solution will be to neglect them," he says. 
This might seem an attractive notion &dash. the woods gradually returning to nature &dash. but the much-loved appearance of traditional woodland comes from centuries of management and sustainable exploitation. 
A neglected wood usually becomes a mess &dash. full of impenetrable brambles, often damaged by introduced species, like the grey squirrel, and <tag "511343">invaded</> by fast-growing foreign species such as sycamore.   

800018
Additionally, if those countries were to embrace the paradigm-shift from military security of the 1980s to environmental security in the 1990s, with all its budgetary implications, it is difficult to believe that the arms trade from North to South would survive for long in all its current extravagance. 
As the UN's World Commission on Environment and Development noted in the Drundtland Report, `the recent destruction of much of Africa's dryland agricultural production was more severe than if an <tag "518924">invading</> army had pursued a scorched earth policy.

And God help the little sparrow that dares to close its eyes or shuffle its tiny feet during a performance. 
Mums and dads in the rows behind will soon give a practised twist to its ear. 
I saw so many of these earnest young hopefuls that one day, I'm sure, we will be <tag "511340">invaded</> by battalions of these wunderkinder descending by parachutes above the Royal Festival Hall, violins strapped to their backs.   

800020
Neither, it was clear, could strike a quick final blow against the other. 
The Germans could not invade Great Britain. 
The British had no forces with which to <tag "511216">invade</> the continent.   

800021
The next argument &dash. restoring democracy &dash. is morally powerful. 
But it would, in theory, give the US the `right" to <tag "511216">invade</> any country &dash. such as China &dash. which denied democratic rights or subverted an election.

Lord Aldington, 75, a frail and stooping figure, was allowed to give his evidence while seated. 
His first action had been in Greece in late 1940: `We soon went to the border, and the Germans <tag "511308">invaded</> from Bulgaria and Yugoslavia which they had romped through.   

800026
One historian has given this explanation of the British victory: `Whereas Dowding and Park proved capable of standing up to men who wanted them to do the wrong things, their German counterparts proved incapable of standing up to Goering." 
On 16 July Hitler directed that preparations should go forward for <tag "511216">invading</> Great Britain.

PLANTING oak trees around unattractive conifer plantations to shield them from view may be hastening the demise of Britain's red squirrels, scientists warn. 
The oaks encourage the <tag "511343">invading</> grey squirrels, which have already ousted the smaller native species from most of the country. 

800028
Yes, they are the largest settlements and that proves to the world and proves to everybody how the Palestinians chose Kuwait as a place to live, rather than Iraq or any other state. 
But we have reports that Palestinians and other ex-patriots they helped the <tag "518924">invading</> Iraquis and took part in the looting.   

800029

Armenia, the scene of fearful destruction with half its population refugees from Turkish persecution, continued to press claims for the return of its homelands in Turkey. 
The Turks <tag "511308">invaded</>, but the Red Army was now beginning to re-establish order and a Turkish withdrawal was negotiated.   

800031
Those whom Balfour had described as `the existing non-Jewish communities of Palestine" were about to undergo their first catastrophe. 
The Arab armies that <tag "511216">invaded</> the new Israel were driven out, together with between 500,000 and 700,000 Arab Palestinians whose homes had been in that part of Palestine that was now Israel or in those areas of Arab Palestine that the Israeli s captured.

It is based on a series of Justice Department interpretations of US law, one handed down as recently as last weekend. 
`Even if one accepts this argument, and many don't," said a lawyer, `does the US really have the right to <tag "511216">invade</> a whole country with 24,000 troops just to arrest one man?"  

800033
It was claimed that it would do more. 
The defeat of Italy would be a blow against Hitler's prestige; it would even be a weakening of his power &dash. a perverse argument considering that the British felt stronger at having shaken off their alliance with France. 
Moreover, victory in the Mediterranean would enable the British to <tag "511216">invade</> Italy herself and would thus open a door into Europe. 

800034
This sort of metaphor became a constant refrain in Israel. 
Weeds had to be destroyed, torn out by their roots. 
The Palestinians &dash. civilians as well as guerrillas &dash. were part of `a cancer", one of the <tag "518924">invading</> soldiers would later tell us.

Moulin was essentially betrayed, he says, `for a few dollars more". 
THERE HAVE been few English abbesses of Orthodox convents, and there had been none in the mountains of southern Serbia before a middle-aged woman set out from London to become Mother Maria, the abbess of Gradac. 
Her eyrie perches on a mountain amid ravines and gorges dotted with ruined castles, the legacy of ancient battles between Serbs, Bulgarians and <tag "518924">invading</> Turks.   

800036
Peaceful demonstrators were vulnerable if their espousal of an unpopular cause moved to violence a hostile crowd or those who saw the message as threatening or insulting. 
Anti-apartheid demonstrators were prosecuted for <tag "511340">invading</> court number 2 at Wimbledon during a match involving the South African, Cliff Drysdale; the House of Lords ultimately decided that the meaning of `insulting" was properly a matter for the magistrates (who had acquitted in this case) and allowed the defendant's appeal against the Divisional Court's decision that the conduct had been insulting.

The islands were settled successively by Malayo-Polynesians, Bantu Africans, religious immigrants from Shiraz in Iran, and the Arabs. 
They were <tag "511216">invaded</> by slave raiders from Madagascar and received a massive influx of slaves itself from the African mainland, especially the Makua from Mozambique.

Mr Wright could not be happier. 
`In no way are we planning to obstruct the wild life," he said. 
`They are the most important part of the scene and I think we can count on the elephants and hippos wandering through and the crocs <tag "511340 or 511343">invading</> the waterholes."  

800041
The new Gorbachev strategy of removing ideology from inter-state relations ran against the Gromyko legacy. 
Gorbachev and Shevardnadze also criticised the decision to <tag "511216">invade</> Afghanistan which Gromyko was party to, arguing that Soviet foreign policy in the 1960's and 1970's relied too much on military power and too little on political flexibility to achieve its goals.

Faced with this deadlock the British decided on military intervention. 
A well-equipped force dispatched from India, under the command of General Robert Napier, <tag "511216">invaded</> Ethiopia and advanced on Magdala.

When Mrs Esteve-Coll proposes contextual settings for objects and perhaps even an active element in exhibitions, she is berated for turning the museum into a historical theme park. 
But walking into the newly redesigned Science Museum, I was engulfed in a sea of hands-on exhibits bleeping and blooping at me like so many Space <tag "999997">Invader</> machines.   

800045
What had happened in the fourteenth century, mainly French music had become very, very intellectual, very austere, very formal. 
The English at that time had produced a kind of ravishing sensuality which when we <tag "511216">invaded</> Europe in France in the Hundred Years War and influenced the Burgundians, they were fascinated by the kind of sensuous sounds we were producing.  

800046
Today, the buildings of architects such as the London-based Abdel Wahed El-Wakil, the Quinlan Terry of Islam, are expressive of a new traditionalist spirit. 
A disciple of Hassan Fathy, the Egyptian architect and philosopher, El-Wakil is dedicated to the development of an appropriate, vernacular architecture rooted in the faith. 
El-Wakil's stand against the modern blitzkrieg is as much part of a worldwide architectural reaction to Modernism, as it is part of the Islamic world's fightback against the <tag "518924">invading</> West.   

800047
The people, in the shape of an obstreperous native Chicagoan, Jeremy Rifkin. 
Rifkin has been at the forefront of the struggle to make biotechnology accountable to the public since 1977, when he <tag "511340-x">invaded</> the stage at a conference of the National Academy of Sciences, brandishing a banner reading `Don't tread on my genes."

According to Israeli Radio, General Aoun had asked for Israeli military support in the event of a Christian attack, using retired General Antoine Lahd, the commander of Israel's proxy militia in the south of the country, to pass on his appeal. 
But the Israeli government confined itself to warning Syria that it should not endanger Israel's security by its military movements in Lebanon. 
Even the Christian Phalangist militia, which said that it would fight alongside General Aoun if the Syrians <tag "511216">invaded</> east Beirut, has let it be known that it still regards President Hrawi as the legitimate president, and wishes for mediation.

Adults and children spend time learning to read and write so that they may recover and renew what is best even though it is all sadly threatened again by those who destroyed it a generation ago. 
In Brazil the forests are being indiscriminately destroyed and many indigenous peoples, like the Yanomami Indians, are being slowly wiped out as gold prospectors and others <tag "511340">invade</> their lands, poison their rivers, and bring disease and death in their wake.   

800051
Mr Endara led an opposition alliance in elections in May which were annulled by General Noriega when it became clear that the opposition had won a commanding majority. 
Recognising the new government the US put in place, Mr Bush announced the immediate removal of economic sanctions imposed against Panama in an effort to topple the Noriega regime, whose removal has been a key US objective since he was indicted on drug trafficking charges in May 1988. 
President Bush's decision to <tag "511308">invade</>, made last Sunday, was well received in the United States, but the Secretary of State, James Baker, called the reaction abroad `mixed".

It keeps slipping off, she's constantly pulling it back whereas if you look at most women's veils, they just stay put." 
The logistics of interviewing the six women were tough, Murray recalls, not complaining but sorry that there was never more than the absolute minimum amount of time available. 
In Dominica, for example, where she went to interview the impressive, redoubtable 70-year-old Eugenia Charles who has been Prime Minister of the Commonwealth for nine years, and who invited President Reagan to <tag "511216">invade</> Grenada in 1983, she would have loved time to explore what she describes as `the last unspoilt Caribbean island".

`It's a great relief, a great satisfaction to us that agreement has been reached on this." 
Sudden concessions by the Soviet Union and Poland, two countries wary of Germany long before the Nazis <tag "511216">invaded</> them 50 years ago, have given another mighty push to the unity drive Bonn will bring to fruition in December.   

800057
The Nobel Peace Prize in 1975 raised his spirits, but, denied a visa, he had to leave it to his wife, who had been allowed to go abroad for medical treatment, to collect the award for him. 
The Helsinki Accords of 1977 gave him some encouragement, but when Soviet forces <tag "511216">invaded</> Afghanistan in December 1979, Sakharov condemned the action as aggression and supported President Carter's boycott of the Moscow Olympics.
