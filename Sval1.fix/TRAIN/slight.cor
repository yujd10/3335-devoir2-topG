She went on to record it four more times in Montreal, bagging three gold medals in the process. 
After seven years with Karolyi, the 4ft 11in Comaneci combined a perfect centre of gravity and <tag "537043">slight</> body weight (just over six stone) with the muscle strength of a grown man and a complete lack of fear.

Thus Stephen Ball, at 32 the youngest chairman in the Rugby League, explained the first of many alterations carried out this year on gaining control of the slumbering Second Division club. 
Any <tag "537053">slighted</> classicists in West Yorkshire will have been impressed even less by Ball's translation.

How much Nicholson deliberately fed to the media for the purposes of publicizing the two films is difficult to assess. 
It was around this time that he made his eminently quotable quote to Newsweek, `I've balled all the women, I've done all the drugs, I've drunk every drink" which he later corrected as being a <tag "537043">slight</> exaggeration.

`I think so." 
There was a <tag "537043">slight</> pause as he stood there, hands clasped behind him, a kind of fantasy figure in that magnificent uniform, the cross at his throat.

Coming from a writer whose reputation is built on large, expansive, improvisatory novels, these two miniatures seem a bit of an anomaly, or maybe just a diversion. 
A Theft was exhilarating, but it faded very quickly; this new one, too, suffers a <tag "537043">slight</> anticlimactic wobble at its turning point.   

800007
Sign language is almost essential in shops too, but it's a little less embarrassing because you can be more discreet. 
A tiny gesture towards a desired item and a <tag "537043">slight</> flick of the eyebrows is almost enough to complete most transactions. 

800008
Last week a press release issued jointly by the two departments warned pregnant women of the dangers of Chlamydia psittaci, an organism that infects sheep and can cause pregnant ewes to abort. 
Expectant mothers who come into close contact with ewes face a <tag "537043">slight</> risk of infection to themselves and their unborn child.

Though these positions reflect performances at last week's Stella Artois tournament and the latest world rankings, John McEnroe at No. 4 is promoted over Andres Gomez, the new French Open champion, and two fellow Americans in Brad Gilbert and Aaron Krickstein. 
The women's list accords strictly with world positions, although, with so many clay-court specialists included, a case could perhaps have been made for some <tag "537043">slight</> adjustment.

They'll be producing programmes and publications, on a worldwide basis, on an environmental theme.

She was not a garish poster girl or the kind of woman you see on magazine covers, shellacked into bookstall anonymity, but she was much closer to that real yet elusive image those boringly and indeed obscenely ubiquitous categories of commerce keep striving so unsuccessfully to represent. 
That is, her grace was totally unconscious, devastatingly so, movingly unattainable. 
Her femininity was expressed in the <tag "537044">slightest</> tilt of her dark head or the most inconsiderable movement of her shiny boots beneath the table.   

800013
Although she kept Alison so firmly, as in some austere yet not malevolent discipline, at a distance, she could not hate her, even felt a companionable pity observing the discomfort and guilt which proud Alison could not altogether dissemble. 
At times &dash. and Franca was aware of this as a dangerous weakness &dash. she felt a <tag "537043">slight</> momentary urge to `talk" to Alison, to give that tiny fatal signal for which Alison was, sometimes so urgently, so breathlessly, waiting.

We strolled afterwards in the garden, and I could not help noticing the spiked helmets of the Glamorgan Constabulary (known now I suppose as the Clwyd Constabulary) behind the privet hedge. 
`Over there," said my host, tossing a biscuit to the voracious Dobermans, pointing in the direction of Abergavenny. 
There was the <tag "537044">slightest</> tremor in his hand, his voice dropped an octave so as not to alarm the policemen.   

800015
The silversmith's `they" are the security forces, known as the Izni, the local, Tigrinya-language word for `ear". 
Widely scorned and widely feared, the Izni are seen as part and parcel of the regime run from the distant capital, Addis Ababa, the heartland of Amharic speakers. 
Locals blame the regime for importing unpleasant Russians, for bringing Amharic soldiers to patrol the streets, for ruining the economy, for arresting people at the <tag "537044">slightest</> sign of grumbling.

So far, only a lunatic fringe, led by Roland Antoniewicz, a Polish-born admirer of the North Korean dictator, Kim Il-Sung, have joined the new Communist Party. 
As delegates continued their debate over the new manifesto and statutes late into the night, the arithmetic in the hall began to show a <tag "537043">slight</> drop in the reformist support, while numbers of the popular democracy platform doubled to more than 200.

For a short and poignant reflection, consider this fragment from Lo Tong, an eighth century poet, translated by T C Lai in his book At the Chinese Table: The first bowl &dash. how soothing to the throat! 
The second bowl &dash. all feeling of loneliness vanishes; The third bowl &dash. I start searching my soul to find five thousand volumes of ancient tomes; The fourth bowl &dash. a <tag "537043">slight</> perspiration which washes away all unhappy things; The fifth bowl &dash. my bones and muscles all cleansed; The sixth bowl &dash.

Claire Primrose's problem as Alceste in the first act was her lack of rhythmic vitality. 
She has an unfortunately nasal focus to her tone in the upper register, and has <tag "537043">slight</> range of colour, but when confidence improved she was able to make a firm and sweet impression in the big numbers of the other two acts, dignified and moderately accomplished.

`Would that be Freudian?" 
`Freudian my arse," said Sister Marrow in a booming voice from the doorway. 
`Are those saints?" said one of the camera crew, a <tag "537046">slight</> and sensitive-looking youth.

Socialists, too, assumed prosperity and merely sought to distribute its rewards differently. 
They expected the laws of laissezfaire economics to continue in operation, with the <tag "537043">slight</> change that profits would go to the community instead of to individuals.

Mr Collor can expect another 12 million votes from those who supported other conservative candidates.

There would be shouted words of command from Sir Oswald in his Lancashire accent; and then, adjusting his armband, possibly looking around to see if Fruity Metcalfe had turned up, he set off towards Billericay. 
But at once, without the <tag "537044">slightest</> provocation, people started to throw things.

Furthermore, the success of secondary forest varies according to the degree of cattle-use before abandonment, with only half as much biomass on heavily used sites (the predominant type) than on more lightly used sites. 
In some parts of the humid tropics, deforested lands are used for tree plantations, whether coffee, tea, rubber, oil-palm, and other agricultural crops based on trees, or for commercial timber and fuel-wood. 
The first category has little relevance here, since their biomass is generally too <tag "537043">slight</> to make much difference to factors of biomass and hence of carbon-cycling.

It is full of incidental pleasures, but doesn't begin to deliver the substance expected of a film only a little under two hours long. 
In the past, Jarmusch's films have tended to drift geographically or to fall into sections; Mystery Train is firmly set in Memphis, but tells three <tag "537049">slight</> stories, separately titled, that only begin to interweave towards the end, with a barely detectable thickening of texture.

`The documents show that the companies will be able to go straight to the director general of water services for extra price increases," he told the conference. 
The `cost pass-through" mechanism is designed to override the five yearly profit limits set by the director general, called the K-factor. 
Dr Cunningham said this meant prices would rise `for the <tag "537044">slightest</> reason . . Consumers will pay and shareholders will be protected".

I respect Donald Davie's general position. 
But I feel that his blanket disapproval, in this case, takes too <tag "537043">slight</> account of what Arvon means to a great many of his colleagues, and to the much greater number of those who aspire to become his colleagues, or at least to understand better, and in a more creative spirit, what he has written.

This might be to speed the job up to earn a larger bonus or to create some leisure time during the working shift, or to slow the job down so that an impression of busy-ness is created and he is not given further work. 
There may also be short-cuts that the machinist could take in doing the work which may mean <tag "537043">slight</> deviations from the specification in the drawing.

Right in the northern part of South America, in Colombia, the volcanic  chain and the Andean mountain chain get a bit mixed up. 
The mountains swing  away to the east, running into Venezuela, but the volcanic chain after a  short gap in the dreary and fever-ridden jungles of the Isthmus of Panama,  reappears in full vigour in Costa Rica, and extends throughout the Central  American republics of Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala, which are by  reputation as unstable and explosive politically as the many volcanoes that  they contain. 
The Caribbean islands present a <tag "537043">slight</> complication to this simple picture  of a single volcanic chain running up the Americas.

In the excitement of the firing line, he proposed to relinquish the admiralty and take `formal military charge" of the British forces in Antwerp &dash. a proposal which the cabinet received with `ill-concealed merriment" .

Some of the `British" may have been French-speaking Scots or Irish; some of the `French" may have had English as their mother-tongue. 
But it is probably safe to say that in the original four provinces of the Dominion, the English-speaking outnumbered the French-speaking almost three to one. 
In the second place, I cannot find the <tag "537044">slightest</> evidence that at Charlottetown, Quebec, or London the delegates lined up on linguistic lines.

We feel there is a lack of liberty about the way things are done in rugby at the moment which could change quite soon," Griffiths said. 
DESPITE injury worries over David Hulme and Kelvin Skerrett, there were no late withdrawals from the Great Britain side yesterday, and it remains to be seen whether this unusual state of affairs will affect the players' concentration in this afternoon's deciding Test at Wigan. 
Britain have not won a home series against New Zealand, or anyone else for that matter, since 1965, but as they go into the third Test at Central Park they can comfort themselves that the Kiwis are <tag "537043">slight</> underdogs.

The body began, very faintly, in all its parts and regions, to twitch, as if its muscles, its very bloodstream, wished to prove that they could maintain their living functions. 
This scarcely perceptible but ubiquitous twitching, described by Ludens as like the <tag "537043">slight</> tremulous movement of leaves on a tree or ripples on a pool, was one of the strangest, and in an odd way most convincing manifestations of the raising of Patrick.

Flitting backwards and forwards across the frontier between these two zones, whose values, priorities, language and manners were so utterly disparate, Robyn felt like a secret agent; and, as secret agents are apt to do, suffered occasional spasms of doubt about the righteousness of her own side. 
`You know," she mused aloud to Charles one day, `there are millions of people out there who haven't the <tag "537044">slightest</> interest in what we do."

There is quite a bit of research, I think, to show that women do better at maths and science in single sex girls schools. 
On the other hand, my own feeling would be very much that schools have to prepare children for taking their life in the community and the community is mixed sex, it's not single sex, so I have a <tag "537043">slight</> aversion to single sex institutions.

The reference was gone in a moment but hearing it in Mrs Caldecote's gooily sorrowful tones was enough to depress Harry's spirits, not in any case near their zenith at the moment. 
It was not actually raining and he wandered out into the ruinous garden and tried to take in the broken bird-bath, the fallen-in bit of grille over that bridge thing, the hollow oak tree in whose uncomfortably shaped cavity nothing of the <tag "537044">slightest</> interest or importance had ever been done or said.

There are pressures building up for me to do all  sorts of things but I don't want to accept them," she says  confidently, her blue eyes filled with a new purpose.

At the end of Mamet's play, Robert, left alone on the bare stage, gives a valedictory blessing to an imagined audience, aware that life, for himself, has consisted of hamming through a tawdry part scripted by others. 
But is he, as an actor, a concentrated image of what is true for all men, or a special case and cautionary instance? 
Hermetically sealed in the world of theatre, despite its professed valuing of life outside, Mamet's <tag "537049">slight</> but intriguing piece is loath to let you decide.

If he drew a man, he was unable to resist drawing our attention to his sagging belly.

If Felix Bloch is a spy, what were his motives?

She had a superficial air about her that I don't remember from our student days &dash. but, I must say, she looked remarkably unchanged since then, as if the cares and wrinkles that beset the rest of us, had, magically, eluded her. 
She seemed a bit jittery, too, but I put that down to gallery opening nerves &dash. and I gathered from Sir James Lister that the place has only just been renovated and launched as a picture gallery; and that it's the first time he has employed Eliza, who a few weeks ago he didn't know at all.

What is more, you must be able to plan your cropping to meet the needs of your animals, your home, and the market, ordering your rotations well ahead to ensure the correct balance. 
You must know and anticipate your climate and be ever ready to take advantage of any spell of good weather. 
You must have a sound knowledge of the life cycles, nutrition, and management of the different species of animals on your farm, and develop this skill to a point where you can notice, almost instinctively, the <tag "537044">slightest</> signs that a beast is off-colour.

Under the cover of loudly played music Stanek excuses himself: in a long speech of mind-boggling chop logic he proves that his signature will in fact do more harm to the movement than good.

The nearest you get to this is the thrilling moment at the end of Act One when, as though he had engendered them, the thunder and lightning which usher in the next act and a complete change of country, melodramatically erupt during Iago's concluding lines. 
Elsewhere, the close-up, detailed approach which works brilliantly, say, for Imogen Stubbs's affecting Desdemona (the pathos of her disoriented, jittery jauntiness intensified by beautiful touches such as the sepia photograph of her estranged father she keeps on the bedside table in Cyprus or the chocolates from Casio that she has secreted in a locked draw, not because she fears sexual misconstruction but because she would like to be thought too grown-up for frivolous sweet-guzzling by Othello) paradoxically diminishes Iago because it encourages the belief that he can be realistically `explained" like a figure in a novel.

The celebrated Canon's rooms were indescribably filthy since he wouldn't allow any scout to clean them and, yes, he was more inaudible than Tolkien. 
However, these men were committed humanists, and the last of a vanishing breed. 
When Heidegger was made Rector of Freiburg University, the Socratic stance in German academia came to an end and, as Allan Bloom puts it, `the most sinister formula in his Rectoral Address of 1933 was, with only the <tag "537044">slightest</> of alterations, the slogan of the Americans who collaborated with the student movements of the sixties."

And he had a notorious asperity for which he was afterwards sometimes penitent. 
Treating his pupils to the compliment of rational disagreement sometimes spilled over into a verbal contest so fierce that the young person concerned was abashed or even frightened. 
The feelings may be imagined of the pupil who rashly let fall a <tag "537062">slighting</> reference to Sohrab and Rustum, to be answered by Lewis's brandishing an old regimental sword of his brother's which stood in the corner of his room and shouting, `The sword must settle this!"

We have reason to be grateful that after seducing us with his ENO Don Giovanni, Miller abandons us to The `Don Giovanni" Book. 
ACCORDING to its editor, MacNeice's Selected Prose, a companion volume to the Selected Literary Criticism, offers `a discontinuous, largely personal, social, and intellectual history".

Then they almost caught up, though they slipped behind once more when prices ran away in the post-war boom. 
Unskilled labour benefited most: the gap between its wage rates and those of skilled labour was permanently narrowed by the war. 
Material loss was also <tag "537043">slight</>, the gravest being the sinking of about 40 per cent. of the merchant fleet.

But Michelle was not a slippers-by-the-fireside soul, waiting by the kitchen sink for her man to come home from work. 
She was still a free spirit and a model of the age; a woman on the move and who needed a career of her own so that she need not be the <tag "537044">slightest</> bit reliant on others, especially men.   

800091
That represents solid value in uncertain times as was demonstrated by Spirax-Sarco's market performance yesterday when its shares remained unchanged at 234p in a sharply falling market. 
Although the steam market in the developed world is now maturing there is still considerable scope for growth in the developing world. 
But the company's experience in Brazil shows that such expansion can have its risks lending a <tag "537043">slight</> edge of uncertainty to the company's otherwise enviable consistency.   

800092
`Hello there!" he called cheerfully. 
Priem had a <tag "537043">slight</> fixed smile on his face as he looked at Genevieve in the mirror. 

800093
` It seems that the calls (of horses) are highly individual and  mothers and foals in particular can recognize and respond to one  another's voice. 
Some calls have a more general effect, for  instance a loud neigh or whinny may alarm the whole herd &ellip. in the main however, so far as communications between individuals are concerned, visual signals are more important than sounds. 
Horses have a quick eye for <tag "537043">slight</> muscular movements and changes in the posture of their companions and perhaps communicate many of their feelings by signalling in some such subliminal manner. 

800094
As I removed my clothes I was glad that the light was so poor. 
My skin was undoubtedly near to normal in appearance, but a bright light might have exaggerated the <tag "537043">slight</> roughness or the diminishing pinky-red cartography of certain areas on my body.   

800095
Robertson forsook his impersonation of Piggott &dash. and a very good one it was from a man who loves his horse racing &dash. and said: `I would reckon that it wouldn't be that difficult with the pack, half-backs and full-back we've got to conjure a win. 
I think we're <tag "537043">slight</> favourites at 6-4 on, which is more or less saying we are six points the better side."   

800096
It predicts that Britain's growth will be 0.9 per cent this year and 1.9 per cent in 1991, with unemployment rising over the next 18 months by 0.5 per cent, or around 200,000. 
The balance of payments will improve over the same period, halving as a proportion of GDP, but reductions in the rate of inflation promise only to be <tag "537043">slight</>, it adds.   

800097
A strange choice of piece too: Swansong is one of Chekhov's shortest playlets (the text is seven and a half pages long), with a playing time (according to Chekhov) of 20 minutes &dash. extended by Wilson to one hour and 15 minutes. 
It is a two-hander between the prompter and the elderly comic actor, who wakes up from a drunken sleep to find himself alone in the darkened theatre, and launches into a self-pitying monologue &dash. a <tag "537049">slight</> and saccharine forerunner of Mamet's A Life in the Theatre and many a play between.   

800098
We talked about the moths for a bit, and then someone asked what she had done with the mask. 
`I threw it out," she said, in a tone of <tag "537043">slight</> disgust. 

800099
If there is one country that should never have gambled in this game, it is Britain. 
Our bargaining power is <tag "537043">slight</>; the force of our example might be great."

`Let's give him something to think about then," and he guided her firmly through the crowd and out through the french windows. 
There was a <tag "537043">slight</> chill to the air and they stayed under the colonnade because of the rain.   

800101
Robson, who watched Rocastle last Saturday, said: `He has made a good start to the season. 
When he got on as a substitute against Sweden he was first class; in Albania he was one of our best players." 
Steve McMahon, who is to deputise in midfield for the injured Neil Webb, missed England's workout at Bisham Abbey yesterday along with Gary Stevens, Tony Adams, Paul Gascoigne and Gary Lineker, but their injuries are <tag "537043">slight</>.   

800102
ALBERTO TOMBA broke his collarbone in the men's World Cup Alpine skiing super-giant slalom in Val D'Isere, France, yesterday; and will be out of action for three weeks. 
The Italian slalom and giant slalom Olympic champion fell halfway down the artificial snow course, and was immediately taken to hospital. 
An examination revealed a <tag "537043">slight</> fracture of the left collarbone, and doctors said Tomba would need a three-week rest. 

800103
The title of Woody Allen's Oedipus Wrecks is the only cringe-making thing about it. 
Although it starts in familiar territory, with Allen addressing the camera like a stand-up comic &dash. except that he's actually talking to his psychiatrist &dash. the film soon comes into its own. 
It's a <tag "537049">slight</> piece of work, but it shows Allen moving beyond the false oppositions (notably humour as the enemy of profundity) that have unbalanced some of his recent work. 

800104
Imagine, for a moment, what it must be like to be the parent of young children in a poor community in Bangladesh or Mozambique. 
To dread the <tag "537044">slightest</> sneeze or cough that might herald the onset of polio or tuberculosis.  

800105
Then, Hubert Gaily dropped the six remaining snowdrops on to the coffin. 
They made a faint brushing sound as they fell. 
It was not a sentimental gesture, and Gaily felt nothing save curiosity, though there was, perhaps, a <tag "537043">slight</> element of touching wood.   

800106
Agnes actually put her hands over her ears as she looked at Jessie sitting close to her on the edge of the bed. 
Her sister's head was bowed and her hands, clasped tightly into fists, were resting on her knees. 
`You must be mad, insane," Agnes almost yelled at her, only to clap a hand over her mouth and glance towards the door as if expecting it to open and her mother to appear; and for a while there was silence between them, except for the <tag "537043">slight</> moaning sound coming from Jessie.  

800107
King thereupon resigned and Meighen became Prime Minister. 
I had not, even then, the slightest doubt that Lord Byng's refusal of Mr King's request for a dissolution of Parliament was completely constitutional, and indeed essential to the preservation of parliamentary government. 
Nor had I the <tag "537044">slightest</> doubt that Meighen's temporary government of ministers without portfolio, acting ministers of departments, was constitutional. 

800108
Also its leakage is at the industry average of 20 per cent and could be halved were meters introduced. 
The group is pushing up capital spending to #400 million a year over the next three years including a #50 million contract to refurbish the Frankley water treatment works in Birmingham which produces water with `a <tag "537043">slight</> brown tinge".   

800109
But there are deeper emotions in play. 
One of them is a <tag "537043">slight</> touch of sour grapes.   

800110
Perhaps we could all be a lot more tolerant of ourselves for sometimes longing to be beautiful if we considered for how many years of our lives this had been held out to us as an ideal. 
The baby book gives us another glimpse into parents' and societies' attitudes towards girls' bodies with the comment that Alison is `prudish" about her body at ten, and the noting of her `<tag "537043">slight</> breast development".   

800111
If public policy required this, it seemed to him reasonable that the same public policy should provide alternative means of compensation. 
The judge said it would be much easier for the court to override an objection by the minister if there was only a <tag "537043">slight</> risk of damage and not a substantial probability.   

800112
At Chepstow, the Clerk of the Course, Rodger Farrant, reports that tomorrow's meeting is in no danger. 
`We could have raced here at dawn today, even though we had the <tag "537044">slightest</> of frosts for the first time this week," he said.   

800113
Retailers and bankers were the least optimistic. 
Nationally there was also a <tag "537043">slight</> rise in the number of companies planning to lay off workers &dash. 13 per cent, which was 2 per cent up on last year.   

800114
Both in choosing partners and in adapting to them, those who marry later may gain from longer experience of social relationships. 
There were early marriages to be found in all social groups, but there was a <tag "537043">slight</> tendency, in line with national figures, for working-class couples to marry a year or so earlier.   

800115
Robson is expected to announce a full-strength team today, and it will be interesting to see whether this includes Chris Waddle and John Barnes on the flanks. 
Both played in Poland, but Robson may wish to take a look at David Rocastle on the right and the Arsenal player, who almost swallowed his tongue after a collision at Millwall on Saturday, said yesterday: `I've trained without any after-effects and want to play." 
Barnes, who was in brilliant form despite Liverpool's defeat at Loftus Road, has a <tag "537043">slight</> foot injury, but Robson expects him to be fit.   

800116
Tashan On The Horizon (OBR/CBS 465521) Part of Russell Simmons' more mainstream black music realignment of the Def Jam organisation following his split with partner Rick Rubin, Tashan is a smooth soul balladeer in the early-Seventies social-conscience tradition. 
The credits to `Great Feeling" give `special vocal thanks" to Marvin Gaye &dash. most likely for a sample of `Sexual Healing" &dash. but this is just the most overt example of a Gaye infatuation which manifests itself in a variety of ways, from Tashan's phrasing and his choice of subjects (snogging and social issues) to the schmaltzy sophistication of Sam Sever's arrangements, which constitute the majority of the album. 
There's nothing wrong in having dominant influences, of course &dash. especially one like Gaye &dash. but Tashan takes things to ridiculous lengths on On The Horizon, which is plainly intended as his What's Going On?, with certain tracks directly corresponding to songs on the earlier work: `Save The Family", for instance, is a <tag "537049?">slight</> return to `Save The Children", and `Black Man" a thinly disguised `What's Going On?".   

800117
`That one went out years ago." 
He leaned back in his chair, fingertips pressed together, a <tag "537043">slight</> frown on his face as he considered her.

Building more roads would relieve congestion which `is a major cause of poor energy efficiency". 
Professor Fells said that `we have to reduce the amount of energy used by investing in public transport: building more roads is not the <tag "537044">slightest</> help".   

800119
The waxen Benazir looked out through heavily-painted eyes with a studied look. 
There was the <tag "537044">slightest</> hint of a smile as if she had just survived a vote of no confidence.   

800120
She kept smiling and pushing at the air like somebody trying to shush applause and saying it had been a marvellous party but she absolutely had to go. 
Not once did she give the <tag "537044">slightest</> hint that she in any sense had to, or that she might have preferred to stay even a couple of minutes longer or that going was anybody's idea but hers.   

800121
`With proper rest and therapy, there is every chance he could lead a normal life," said Dr Arthur Wright, who repaired a ruptured disc at the base of Montana's spine. 
`But there is only a <tag "537043">slight</> possibility that he'll play football again."   

800122
She saw friends whom she knew he would dislike. 
Among them was Noel Spens, a young reporter, who was in fact a <tag "537043">slight</> acquaintance of Paul's, and whose accurate mockery of her husband Dora accepted with vehement protests, knowing it eased something in her heart. 

800123
Maggie laid down the job in hand and wiped her forehead. 
She had a <tag "537043">slight</> headache from the noise of the factory which, for some reason, seemed worse than usual She was opening the cupboard containing her piece when she saw Nevil hurrying over.   

800124
The CBI poll, conducted largely before the latest rise in base rates, reveals a steep fall in business confidence, a decline in new orders for the first time in three years and weakening investment intentions. 
And it also shows that there was a <tag "537043">slight</> build-up in stocks in the four months to October.  

800125
The Government declines to define `full employment", but according to the independent Institute of Employment, it is commonly taken to be anywhere with less than 3 per cent unemployment. 
It is never zero, because on the day the count is made there will always be people changing jobs, with a <tag "537043">slight</> gap between.   

800126
Today, that wind seems to be blowing the other way. 
Although the Department of Employment's latest figures show a <tag "537043">slight</> increase in service sector employment to the middle of 1989 (a trend which may have been sustained in the past few months), headlines, for once, have been full recently of job losses in non-manufacturing industries.

He was also absolutely straight," says a Home Office colleague. 
A <tag "537046">slight</> man, without any physical presence, he seemed shy when meeting officials.

In the same year, the Hoppers' Bel Air mansion was all but burnt down in a fire and virtually the whole of Dennis's collection of poems and paintings were destroyed. 
Peter Fonda was, in that year, also heading towards Hollywood, without the <tag "537044">slightest</> encouragement from his father.

The Penrod stories were published in America in 1913, and appeared in Britain in 1915, four years before the first William story came out. 
Margaret Disher thinks it unlikely that her aunt, whose tastes were highbrow, would have bothered to read the stories, which were <tag "537049">slight</>.   

800131
That may be one theory, but in truth events have left Mr Bush with little choice but to move on the deficit and dissemble on abortion. 
Years of false budget accounting have been exposed by a <tag "537043">slight</> downward shift in the economy. 

800132
Thus even if the jury conscientiously wished to adhere to the black-letter law expounded by the judge, the verdict may well &dash. unintentionally &dash. express a deviant jury law. 
The artificiality and formalism of the instructions has been foisted on trial courts by the appellate practice of word-paring and readiness, when so inclined, to reverse for the <tag "537044">slightest</> error.

`Certainly not.

About #35 for two. 
Now that the Sun is passing through your own birth sign, you are certain to be at your most forthright, purposeful and ready to go into battle at the <tag "537044">slightest</> provocation. &dash. What took place towards the very end of March should have made you realise that this is very much a time to hold you fire when dealing with important professional issues.

However, US manufacturing has shown increasing signs of weakness in recent months and yesterday official figures showed that industry used slightly less of its manufacturing capacity last month. 
The dollar retreated on the reports but its losses in London were <tag "537043">slight</>.

What the Labour party did was, at the time, of little moment. 
The National government had the power and the authority to do whatever they wished, with some <tag "537043">slight</> deference perhaps to `national" unity.   

800137
Vialli, it seems, will return at the earliest opportunity. 
`He has a <tag "537043">slight</> pain in his right thigh," said Vicini, `and we thought there was no sense forcing him into a game that, while important, is not absolutely crucial."

The last link in our tenuous volcanic chain lies even further south: south  of latitude 50 degrees; Bouvet Island, desolate, inaccessible and almost  entirely icebound. 
Little is known of eruptions there, but there may have been one in the last  decade, since sets of aerial photographs of the island taken many years  apart show some <tag "537043">slight</> changes.

Acceleration two up, with half tanks, was smooth and sure and the aircraft left the ground at about 30 knots. 
A <tag "537043">slight</> check forward followed, allowing the airspeed to increase to around 45 knots and then the climb commenced at around 300 to 400 ft/min.

For a time the advertisements succeeded, but the problem was that the `Queen" had no moral sense of how to treat servants.

The total cost was less than 2 per cent of the gross proceeds of the sale.

One of the joys of this discovery is that we no longer have to take sides: we can discuss things as enquiring adults. 
Only on the last page does Williams show the <tag "537044">slightest</> awareness of what has been happening in the last 12 months.

His body took it in, took her in, and the desire which reared in him was the strongest he had ever experienced.

While we might say that Peter's likeness to James is equal to his likeness to John &ellip 
this does not mean that any <tag "537043">slight</> additional resemblance to either would decide the issue; hence it does not mean that this equality expresses an improbably exact balance."   

800150
EVEN in the present difficult conditions for consumer-related products, yesterday's announcement of first-half figures from Reed International brought a spate of profit upgradings and a 15p rise in the share price. 
Peter Davis must be wondering why the message has taken so long to sink in, although at first sight the pre-tax profit shows a <tag "537043">slight</> decline, from #133m to #128m.

Goffs evolved from ailing business to innovative leaders of the European sales scene, largely under Irwin's guidance. 
Irwin was the first in Europe to introduce a valuable race for two year olds restricted to graduates of a specific auction, the Cartier Million race making its debut last year. 
Perhaps it was no coincidence that the Cartier Million Sale in October was the most disappointing to date, with an unexceptional catalogue yielding a <tag "537043">slight</> downturn in figures.   

800157
I think, I mean, if you take Elgar I think what we admire about Elgar is this very strange, slightly introverted quality, this dark quality, this fluidity, this flexibility, this lack of rigid formal devices.

It shows a fall from 14.5p to 13.6p a share in the first six months of 1988 and 1989 respectively and of 14.6p to 13.3p in the second six months. 
`It is a ridiculous use of figures," countered Mr Hargreaves. 
The past two years had shown a <tag "537043">slight</> fall, he said, because Hestair had had a rising tax charge as it had used up its tax losses.

Just behind in 17th position was John Liversidge 61.21, Peter Chivers finished well in 63.27 (27th) while Jim Sowerby clocked 68.08 (45th). 
Having another good race, Nigel Lambert finished with a creditable time of 71.46 (60th) and Mick Clark, overcoming a <tag "537043">slight</> leg injury, recorded a pleasing time of 74.24 (68th position overall).

One week before attending the special clinic, Jonathan had noticed some staining of his underpants and on examining his penis, not a thing he was in the habit of doing, he found that he could express a little clear mucoid discharge from it. 
Now that his mind had been alerted, he examined himself several times a day and, when the discharge didn't go away, he decided to attend. 
He had also noticed that there was a <tag "537043">slight</> discomfort when he passed urine.

In addition to these radical techniques for the prevention of rising damp, there exist various patent methods and materials designed to alleviate or conceal small areas of dampness, including a system in which small-diameter porous ceramic tubes are inserted in external walls in order to `vent away" the dampness. 
Such a system, together with the several forms of `dry-lining" damp-concealment construction which are available, is best reserved for the treatment of only very <tag "537043">slight</> occurrences of damp penetration.

The principal justification of the contingent fee commonly averred is that it provides easier access to justice for plaintiffs irrespective of their financial resources. 
Our earlier discussion of the American rule emphasized the importance of risk aversion on the decision to litigate especially by persons of modest means, concluding that on balance that rule probably had a <tag "537043">slight</> edge on fee-shifting in this respect.

Things were different when international affairs took the centre of the stage. 
Two survivors among the junior ministers assisted him on the front bench: Stafford Cripps, then almost unknown except as a successful company lawyer, his main interest hitherto in the reunion of the Churches ; and C.

This romantic view of the Germanic commune had an unconscious effect on Marx and led him to follow those German historians who were trying to reconstruct an old system which they say as smothered by a newer one. 
Whatever the historical value of such a procedure, and it was <tag "537043">slight</>, it inevitably produced a rather shadowy type of society owing more to nationalist imagination than to recorded facts.

Finally, the new working class had no interest in a separate nation; their natural allies were the workers of Petrograd, Moscow and other cities of the empire.

This situation exists in Hawaii, where lavas are often  initiated in the high, barren parts of the island, and then flow down  towards more fertile, productive areas. 
In 1935 for example, lavas were erupted from the north-east flank of Mauna  Loa volcano at an altitude of about 2,700 metres, and began flowing down  towards the coast, threatening the port of Hilo, some forty kilometres from  the vent. 
Hilo lies in a <tag "537043">slight</> depression, which tends to channel lavas  towards the city, so the situation was critical.

Many estate agents were whistling to keep up their confidence this week, claiming that people were already used to the idea of higher mortgage rates and that the latest increase would make little difference. 
But Gary Marsh, head of research with the Halifax, the UK's biggest building society, says it is inevitable that the modest improvement seen in the market over the last couple of months &dash. especially in the South, where sellers have started to adjust to more realistic levels &dash. will be damaged and the date of its recovery put back.

SUCH IS the fragile nature of fame that Henry Hall, Britain's best known bandleader of the Thirties, Forties and Fifties, is unknown to younger generations. 
Yet in his heyday, through his radio dance band shows and his pioneering chat-show, Henry Hall's Guest Night, he was as nationally famous a broadcaster as Terry Wogan is today. 
Everybody knew his `Here's to the next time" signature tune and his regular greeting, delivered with a <tag "537043">slight</> stammer, `Hello everyone, this is Henry Hall speaking."

Major General Sir William Dornberg received the pencil-written despatch in the town hall at Mons which he had made into his headquarters, and where he had transformed the ancient council chamber into his map room. 
The panelled room, hung with dusty coats of arms, suited his self-esteem, for Dornberg was a very proud man who was convinced that Europe did not properly appreciate his military genius. 
He had once fought for the French, but they had not promoted him beyond the rank of colonel, she had deserted to the British who had rewarded his defection with a knighthood and a generalship, but even so, he still felt <tag "537053">slighted</>.

This year, ambitious plans have also been launched for more than a dozen large new forests, which would increase Britain's woodland cover by a fifth.

Describing the season as `one of my happiest working years", he explained that the two most essential factors in the creation of a ballet are teamwork and a mutual belief. 
Because ballet has no working notation it exists only when it is performed, and it may further be said that the decor and music only have their true existence when seen and heard in conjunction with the choreography for which they were designed. 
Consequently the three creators of a ballet are entirely dependent on the human beings who interpret their style and ideas: the <tag "537044">slightest</> lack of understanding from wardrobe-mistress, coryphe&acute.e, or instrumentalist, and some important fragment of the production can be lost.

Children born to fat parents often have a tendency to become fat as well. but is this because of the family's bad eating habits, or is there a genetic factor? 
Professor John Durnin, of Glasgow University's Institute of Physiology, thinks there probably is a <tag "537043">slight</> genetic factor involved, meaning that if your mother is overweight, the scales are tilted a little towards you following suit.

As the West German captain met a dropping ball, he turned away from Jozic's challenge and in the same movement drove an excellent left-footed shot past Ivkovic, who was taken by surprise and dived over the ball.

But now that I had the Bug to care for three days a week, I noticed that this phrase, which I had remembered only as something puzzlingly out of character, was coming to mind increasingly frequently, and seeming each time to capture more exactly the real pneumatics of the parental sensation: sometimes in looking at the Bug I felt as it I was crumpling up, hunching my shoulders, deflating like a pool-side flotation toy to be folded away for the winter &dash. the same collapsing feeling that Mal Green had induced by forcing me to play the Chiarnovsky in one breath: not the vocal hoarseness of prolonged shouting or whispering or even of talking for hours on a long car trip, but the deeper lungier expiration of blowing up a balloon (especially on an empty stomach), and transferring your pneuma to it. 
My mother, who I think loved my sister and me to the point of heart-hoarseness, taught us how to make clay coin banks by blowing up and tying balloons and then wrapping them in gray clay: we pinched the surfaces of the clay-covered balloons into guinea pigs or owls or bullfrogs (one of the teaching assistants did a nice caricatured head of my mother), but as we worked we were still able to sense the poppable resilience of the pale spheres underneath. 
And then coin slots were carefully cut and the clay banks were allowed to dry and fired to an off-white gritty color in a kiln: and our selfless balloons within were &dash. my mother taught us the word &dash. `vaporized" in thousands of degrees of heat: I shook my heavy frog bank and heard a <tag "537043">slight</> dead-light-bulb tinkle &dash. crumbs no doubt of the vanished but heroic balloon (of the bunchier, tied navel part that always tended downward when the balloon was aloft?), which had been consumed, along with our hoarse inflating breaths, in order to maintain the essential hollowness around which an animal likeness was only decoration, a hollowness I slowly filled with coins I found in the cool depths of the blue couch or under the seat of the car or on the alcove rug near the stereo albums, and then restored once again by sliding the change coin by coin out of the slot with the blade of a butter knife, as a baby-sitter showed us, in order to buy Christmas presents, and then filled up again.

Special committees meet regularly to discuss everything from investment in irrigation projects in remote Chinese provinces to what guarantees should be offered to foreign property owners after communism collapses. 
Commission researchers originally predicted this collapse would take place in three stages: the pre-recovery period, during which `Taiwan will become a bastion for the counterattack"; the recovery period, for which the commission has prepared a `manual of battle-field administration"; and the post-recovery period of `national rehabilitation." 
After 40 years of waiting to get beyond even the first stage, however, even the most diehard veterans concede that the chances of reconquering the mainland by force are <tag "537043">slight</>.

This is an additional reason to ensure that carbohydrate foods are eaten in their wholegrain form (where there is an adequate supply of B vitamins).

Often the sole ornament applied to mills was projecting angle piers and a small cornice near the top of the facade, surmounted by a `blocking course" of bricks, although some very large mills built during the Edwardian period, when labour and materials were cheapest, display elaborate decorative brickwork. 
It is apparent that the conversion to domestic use of a textile mill up to 48m (158ft) wide is like to pose problems. 
Partly for this reason and partly because of <tag "537043">slight</> local demand for living accommodation so markedly individualistic as apartments created in former textile factories (which may not be entirely free from unpleasant associations), only one or two of the smaller, older and picturesquely situated textile mills have, to date, been converted into dwellings.

How much Nicholson deliberately fed to the media for the purposes of publicizing the two films is difficult to assess. 
It was around this time that he made his eminently quotable quote to Newsweek, `I've balled all the women, I've done all the drugs, I've drunk every drink" which he later corrected as being a slight exaggeration. 
By then, there was sufficient evidence from his own testimony for the headline writers in the tabloids to begin suggesting that their new-found star had secretly been one of wildest men of Hollywood, without realizing that the secrecy was not entirely intentional; it was merely that since no one knew who he was until a couple of years ago, they had not taken the <tag "537044">slightest</> bit of notice of his private life.

It also had laboriously to be explained that for some time past the Senex `claret" had, for some inexplicable reason, been intermittently `tapped," to flow copiously on the most inconvenient occasions until, all else having failed, the experience was deemed to warrant medical attention. 
Accordingly this was sought, and the advice received was that the most appropriate course to adopt was a prompt visit to that division of the great hospital in the Woodstock Road dedicated to the treatment of ailments affecting the ear, nose and throat. 
There was, it has to be admitted, some <tag "537043">slight</> feeling of shame that the efforts of so many charming and extremely busy people should have been evoked for so exiguous a purpose, but all remonstrance was brushed aside when it was mentioned, particularly by the young surgeon for whom the latest disorder brought to his attention might have been the highlight of his professional career.

It's certainly true that the methods of treatment that we use in miocenia gravis at the moment are not specific.

Berger was well aware that he had fractionally anticipated the start and he was not unduly surprised when news of the penalty was radioed to him from the pit wall, alerting him to make up as much of this unwelcome deficit as possible during the course of the race.

Or was that a piece of intentional whimsy? 
The language of this book is at once overweight and <tag "537049">slight</>, and its larger ambitions swamp Frame's genuine talents.   

800258
I point out that I'm slightly older than 10. 
Among the other delights were a set of magnetic L plates, (which fall off if you go over the <tag "537044">slightest</> bump) and a set of fluffy dice.

The supernatural is as numbed as the natural: equipped with microphone headsets and miniature televisions, the witches are played as suave technocrats, moving among humanity with invisible malice, sometimes doubling as murderers. 
Only in the language &dash. spoken with clarity throughout, especially by Simon Tyrrell as Macbeth, and Peter Granger-Taylor as Ross &dash. does any <tag "537043">slight</> consolation remain. 

800261
Of course, one must be careful not to overstate the case on a biomewide basis. 
In much of the island of New Guinea, population pressures are <tag "537043">slight</> to date, and appear unlikely to become significant within the foreseeable future.   

800262
A south entrance on Wharfedale Road was considered, with a main corridor along the longer north-south axis, but this would have sliced the building into two narrow segments, so entrance doors on Crinan Street to the west were finally adopted. 
Visitors enter the slate-floored reception area up a <tag "537043">slight</> ramp from the door &dash. the tall, interior brick elevation, with its curiously convoluted buttress, slides away to the left.

My mother's chief worry had been Caesarean section, or, as she put it, `the knife." 
Tzippy is very <tag "537046">slight</>, `not built for childbearing," my mother repeated throughout the five months she knew of Tzippy's pregnancy. 

800264
But nothing more was heard until 29 September, when the first reasonably detailed account appeared in the defence ministry newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda. 
This made not the <tag "537044">slightest</> reference to radiation after-effects.

A summary of the report, released yesterday, says police in general should be commended for the `professional way they conducted themselves in the face of provocation". 
Only 16 demonstrators out of a crowd of about 4,000 in the area of the charge received injuries, all but one of which were <tag "537043">slight</>.   

800266
But Dylan had begun recording in Nashville as early as 1966, when he cut Blonde On Blonde there. 
He had also signalled his change of direction away from encyclopaedic, apocalyptic rock on John Wesley Harding, where songs of profound spiritual quest were capped by this hummable but <tag "537049">slight</> ditty, complete with curling pedal steel guitar. 

800267
What is more, he develops a temporal skull fracture on the way to his terminal depression of spirit. 
This seems, in the character portrayed in the film if not in the actor himself, the <tag "537044">slightest</> of his handicaps &dash. the others being an inability to speak clearly, a complete absence of talent and a mournful expression that would make the most temperate of associates reach for his gun after five minutes of attempted conversation.

At the same time, his country was playing host to Ashkenazy just a mile or so away at the Conservatoire. 
Last weekend, as anybody with even a <tag "537043">slight</> interest in music must have been aware, conductor-pianist went to Russia for the first time since he `emigrated", as Radio Moscow delicately put it, 26 years ago.

In 1987-88, the cost of policing was #3,355,000, 32 per cent of which was provided by the trust. 
Closed circuit television has made policing easier and the report provides evidence to back clubs" belief that there has been a decline in hooliganism over the last four seasons. 
Only nine cases of misconduct were reported to the FA last season compared with 42 in 1982-83, while they say a <tag "537043">slight</> rise in arrests reflects the effectiveness of CCTV coupled with the creation of new offences under recent legislation.

Well, I fell in bed rather than in my bath." 
She gave a <tag "537043">slight</>, sad smile, stood up and took a few paces round the bedroom.

In the living room she picked up a couple of wine glasses from the floor and set them down on a coffee table.

The particulars of claim form should be redesigned to make sure that the plaintiff fills in the details correctly. 
Can you imagine an insurance company processing an accident claim form for five months, and the insurance company on the other side trying to argue against it, when neither has the <tag "537044">slightest</> idea of the date of the accident?  

800276
A spot light was stolen and petrol siphoned from a car parked in Park Road, Combe over the weekend. 
Motor cyclist Peter Roberts from Poole received <tag "537043">slight</> head and shoulder injuries when he was involved in an accident with a car on Saturday afternoon near Bletchingdon on the A4095.

Once, in Rome, he telephoned Anjelica who was in London to ask if she had packed his comb, because he couldn't find it and did not want to go out and buy a new one if it was there. 
The years of shuffling were paying off, notwithstanding a <tag "537043">slight</> dip in his fortunes with Drive, He Said, and the autumn of 1973 marked his final departure from that protective familial environment that had virtually maintained him throughout his career, first with Roger Corman and then with BBS.

He had no particular urge, either, to murder anyone else, a thing he had noticed happening to quite a few murderers. 
Once they had tasted blood, some characters seemed to get a nose for chopping up people into easily manageable portions and leaving them in left-luggage compartments. 
A <tag "537043">slight</> lowering of their moral standards seemed to bring on an uncontrollable urge to be beastly, an urge Henry did not feel.

The average house in the county was selling for #76,700 in the three months from April to June, compared to #73,040 in the previous quarter and #72,792 in the fourth quarter of 1989. 
The <tag "537043">slight</> upturn comes in the wake of a 12-month fall in average house prices in Oxfordshire, where they plunged by more than 20 per cent from a peak of #93,850 at the end of the 1988 boom.   

800280
ANY SHORT-TERM improvement in the housing market appears to have been dashed by November's mortgage rate rise. 
Mortgage demand, which had shown <tag "537043">slight</> signs of improvement in August and September, is once more declining, according to the Halifax, the UK's largest building society.

Greater political freedom is required for competent and efficient economic decision-making. 
For as long as party functionaries control or influence the allocation of resources there is not the <tag "537044">slightest</> chance of the Soviet economy developing on a market model.

Cricket managers have not been a resounding success in the English game but Simpson has more qualifications than most. 
It was largely his grasp of England's strengths and weaknesses this summer &dash. allied to not the <tag "537044">slightest</> hint that England had done any homework themselves &dash. that helped make the series so one-sided.

`Why don't we escape outside?" I answered. 
`The noise is so awful." 
The silence and <tag "537043">slight</> chill of the night fell on us like an old friend.

Any book, or video, with the magical words Manchester United on the cover is an automatic bestseller. 
Visitors and fans from all over the world crowd the club museum in what is now an international institution; listening to them gives a <tag "537043">slight</> notion of how much this team means to so many.

It could be worn in the spring or the autumn." 
Agnes stood still while Miss Rene placed the felt hat at a <tag "537043">slight</> angle on her head and then, standing back, said, `That's it, that's it, except you will want lime-green ribbed-silk ribbon to match the outfit.

These English composers learnt from Ravel &dash. hardly an example of startling modernity.

And let me now posit this: `dignity" has to do crucially with a butler's ability not to abandon the professional being he inhabits. 
Lesser butlers will abandon their professional being for the private one at the least provocation. 
For such persons, being a butler is like playing some pantomime role; a small push, a <tag "537043">slight</> stumble, and the fac&cedilla.ade will drop off to reveal the actor underneath. 

800291
It slouches along like a fearful parody of John Huston's Fat City, the hem of whose garment it is scarcely able to touch. 
Not since that amazing biblical epic, whose name I simply can't recall, showed the Jews arriving at the Promised Land with a drinks van in the rear, has a film tried to be so mortifyingly noble without the <tag "537044">slightest</> hope of transcending its basic daftness. 

800292
In fact, he does not respond at all. 
Finally, the gang resorts to violence &dash. to no avail either; the new co-prisoner is `some kind of a bloody foreigner" who has not the <tag "537044">slightest</> idea what is demanded from him.

`Besides, if you go to the championship too early you can over practice and get bored."

Arthur Henderson joined the cabinet, ostensibly in charge of education, actually the voice of `Labour" . 
This was a portent : the industrial working class took a share of power, however <tag "537043">slight</>, for the first time.  

800295
A simple, practical application of convergent space is now common practice on motorways. 
The marking of transverse lines, visually and also as <tag "537043">slight</> humps, in convergent series gives the motorist a false sense of acceleration.  

800296
The importance of better feeding purely for reasons of efficient production is known and heeded in most developed nations (especially the market economies), which had about 405 million head of cattle in 1988 and 338 million sheep. 
These numbers represent roughly a 5-per-cent reduction in cattle herds since 1980 and a <tag "537043">slight</> increase in sheep. 

800297
It may well be that this reduction in severity of symptoms has brought the symptoms of NSU much closer to those of gonorrhoea and thereby exaggerated their importance. 
In the eighteenth century Boswell describes his attack of gonorrhoea, which is complicated by an attack of epididymo-orchitis, and, after a miserable six weeks of self-imposed confinement at home, rejoices that he is cured because all he can see is a <tag "537043">slight</> `gleet" which he is happy to ignore.

ENTRIES FOR the Stalking Horse Stakes close at noon today and voting takes place next Tuesday.

His wife was not beautiful, like Catherine Fawley, but she was awfully pretty and rather sort of mischievous.

Continentals &dash. and by and large the Celts, as you will no doubt agree &dash. are as a rule unable to control themselves in moments of strong emotion, and are thus unable to maintain a professional demeanour other than in the least challenging of situations. 
If I may return to my earlier metaphor &dash. you will excuse my putting it so coarsely &dash. they are like a man who will, at the <tag "537044">slightest</> provocation, tear off his suit and his shirt and run about screaming. 

800301
In the state which sacrificed most in the war to save slavery, it is extraordinary enough that a black man is the front-runner, with three weeks to polling day. 
In the practical sense it matters enormously to his fellow blacks that Mr Wilder should win. 
A <tag "537046">slight</> man with sleek silver hair and a warm smile, he is a different kind of black politician.  

800302
An SEC survey gave support for this view. 
It showed that bondholders saw a small cut in their investment, but holders of equity benefited substantially. 
There was only a small reduction in employees, allowing for divisions which were sold, and only a <tag "537043">slight</> reduction in salaries.   

800303
Lenin reproved the luckless Shahumyan, 
` Why will you not understand the psychology that is so important in the national question and which, if the <tag "537044">slightest</> coercion is applied, besmirches, soils and nullifies the undoubtedly progressive importance of centralized large States and a uniform language?

I was puzzled for days at this and at his obvious, but controlled, disquiet. 
Then one evening the sheikh, as he left a ritual meeting in one of the houses, stopped next to me and greeted the teenager, who was in the doorway. 
`Are you praying, Muhammed?" he asked with a <tag "537043">slight</> smile.

Warburg has launched a reverse tender offer for the outstanding long-term debt on the bulldog market, the first seen outside the gilt market. 
Oil prices and shipping freight rates were volatile yesterday as markets tried to assess the significance of the closure of the Panama Canal and the Trans-Panama oil pipeline. 
But dealers thought that the impact on prices would be <tag "537043">slight</> unless closures were prolonged.   

800307
In the schools, French became a compulsory language at the very moment when Arab nationalists were enjoying the linguistic triumph of Arabic over the Turkish of the now broken Ottoman Empire, a victory which had important political implications for the concept of Arab unity. 
The teaching of French was seen as a deliberate <tag "537047">slight</> by the Lebanese. 

800308
Priem pushed the door shut, came across and put the suitcases on the bed, then turned. 
There was a <tag "537043">slight</>, grave smile on his mouth, a strange air of expectancy as if he was waiting for something.   

800309
The most detailed studies of  these have been made in Hawaii, where it has been known for a long time  that eruptions of the major basaltic shield volcanoes are preceded by a  general swelling up or tumescence of the whole thing, followed by a general  deflation as the eruption proceeds. 
It's a bit reminiscent of the frozen chicken pie of chapter six: as the pie  cooks, the crust tends to lift and swell; if gravy erupts at the surface,  it subsides. 
The tumescence of the Hawaiian volcanoes, however, is <tag "537043">slight</>, only one  metre or so at the summit, and since the volcanoes are over 3,000 metres  high this represents an extremely small proportionate swelling.   

800310
His protagonist, entirely preoccupied by his affairs with women &dash. that is, by himself &dash. is certainly in need of therapy. 
Were he to show the <tag "537044">slightest</> real appetite for self-knowledge he would have taken steps in that direction.   

800311
She wasn't sure for a moment whether he had seen her and she stood quite still. 
Then a change in his expression, a widening and focussing of his eyes, a <tag "537043">slight</> tensing of his body told her that she had been observed.   

800312
The first step in eradicating dry rot is to find the heart of the outbreak and to trace its extent with great care and thoroughness. 
Each branch of the fungus must be traced from its source to the growing tip, and finishes should be opened up to reveal timber 1/2m (1-1/2ft) beyond the affected material. 
Floorboards, plaster, timber trim, including architraves and skirting boards, and other finishes (including apparently impenetrable tiling) must be removed from timber and masonry if the <tag "537044">slightest</> suspicion exists that the fungus has reached beneath or behind them.   

800313
After these climactic blasts, the  activity gradually declined and all became quiet once more. 
At the time, that was all that was known of the eruption: that three  major explosions had occurred, presumably on Katmai volcano, and that a  huge quantity of ash had fallen. 
No one had seen or experienced anything  more than this, so no one had the <tag "537044">slightest</> idea of what had actually  been happening to the volcano itself.   

800314
His achievements alone would have won admiration, but John Cranko had another quality besides. 
Everything he did was enriched by a warm concern for other people that inspired affection from even <tag "537043">slight</> acquaintances, and love from his closer colleagues.   

800315
Priem hadn't needed to say a word. 
There was a <tag "537043">slight</> creaking as the barrier was raised and then, quite suddenly, another voice, calling sharply from the guardhouse.   

800316
Was it program music? 
Only in the sense (as I would have to explain at defensive length in the program notes) that the daintily vortical second movement of La Mer was program music: and indeed the sound of the air entering the peanut butter jar was meant lovingly to sum up Debussy's lifelong fascination with air &dash. his interest in a technique of piano pedaling that would approximate breathing; his wish for a music whose harmonic progressions, although they might sound stifled in the concert hall, would once out of doors enter into a collaboration with the open air and float joyfully over the tops of the trees; his piano preludes, whose titles (`Voiles," `Le Vent dans la plaine," `Les sons et les parfums tournent dans l'air du soir," `Ce qu'a vu le vent d'ouest," `Brouillards," and so on) repeatedly made aerial references; the recollections by Gabriel Pierne&acute. and Camille Bellaigue that his piano technique was accompanied by his `puffing noisily during the difficult passages" and by `a kind of hiccup or harsh puff" to mark the beginning of every bar. 
I worried that the audience wouldn't have time to get all this if the jar opened too readily, and therefore I hoped that the percussionist would by chance encounter one of those infrequent Peter Pans or Skippy Creamies that was the product of an improperly calibrated piece of screwing machinery, so that as he struggled covertly to turn the lid, increasingly embarrassed and frustrated, his jaw clenched; his fiercely whispered `You little piece of shit!" sizzling from the loudspeaker horns, his membership in the musicians' union suddenly open to doubt, and as he fussily excused himself to go backstage and run the jar under hot water for a minute, we all might use that lucky delay to think of the meteorological greatness stored and quality-sealed in La Mer or, more likely, of times when we had undergone similar failures with jars of peanut butter (or jelly or spaghetti sauce) &dash. when we, or I at least, determined to succeed on a third attempt, pretwisted my hands and allowed the drumstick of thumb flesh on my right hand to settle over the <tag "537043">slight</> tractive fluting on the edge of the lid, while the fingers of this same hand curled and clamped to its curvature, all of them leaning to one side 

800317
As historical re-creation or biography, these films were interesting, as cinema they were nowhere. 
This drift towards incoherence can be seen also in the work of Dick Lester, the most `pop" director of the decade. 
For all that The Mouse on the Moon (1963) is a <tag "537049">slight</> film, its satirical swipes at the unprogressive nature of British institutions and the nation's difficulty in coming to terms with its global insignificance do find their target.   

800318
I could sense the steep drop to my left, though I could not see it due to the trees and thick foliage that lined the roadside. 
The feeling swept over me that I had truly left Darlington Hall behind, and I must confess I did feel a <tag "537043">slight</> sense of alarm &dash. a sense aggravated by the feeling that I was perhaps not on the correct road at all, but speeding off in totally the wrong direction into a wilderness.   

800319
Life goes on. 
I didn't wake up this morning with an extra arm. 
In fact, there's a strange sense of <tag "537043">slight</> anti-climax."

Those included Sir Peter Imbert, now commissioner of the London force. 
While accepting the concocted confessions, taken by Surrey police officers, were supported by the Metropolitan officers, he added: `Nothing has come to light to cast the <tag "537044">slightest</> doubt on the integrity of the Metropolitan officers."   

800321
He is hero, not villain, in this book. 
It's a book which has already had an unpleasantly-rough ride from some critics, who found it <tag "537049">slight</>, lazy, a TV script in novel form.   

800322
But the employers' body, the Local Authorities Conditions of Service Advisory Board, which represents 500 councils, said support was down to 10 per cent in other areas. 
There was a <tag "537043">slight</> decline in support compared with last week.   

800323
Anger had reduced his pupils to pinpoints and he was unhealthily pale. 
There was also a tiredness in the lines about his eyes and a <tag "537043">slight</> stoop in what had previously been a notably erect body. 

800324
My piano teacher, Professor Hofmann &dash. not the famous pianist, another man &dash. had suggested I consider conducting seriously. 
Clemens Krauss had taught classes in the past but he had left the whole thing in the hands of a Professor Wunderer and a man from the Vienna PhilharMonic who was interested in conducting but hadn't the <tag "537044">slightest</> idea how to go about it.   

800325
Yes, probably, but it did not lessen her joy in the past ten years of leisured, ladylike existence and in the arrival of innumerable small parcels. 
Hearing a <tag "537043">slight</> sound, a scraping noise through the wall, Alida, though she ignored it, stiffened her corseted thighs, Aunt Fosters, her mother's last surviving sister, might have had the wit and grace to die in time but it was not a family trait.

The bill was not through parliament when the Labour government fell. 
It was enacted by the National government, with some <tag "537043">slight</> changes, in 1933.  

800328
Councillors wanted to know more about the capital costs and deferred making a decision until their next meeting. 
They considered a report which said extensions to existing buildings and a fenced outdoor area would be needed at William Morris School. 
Greenmere needed `<tag "537043">slight</> alterations" to outside areas and internal adaptations, to accommodate the development.  

800330
`Equally, if you award a sum which is too low that might lead to further litigation as well.

800331
Mark Todd, who finished fourth on Double Take II, had a miserable ride in yesterday's Working Hunter Championship, which was won by Jean Harpham's Bootleg. 
Todd was on Seabrook, who lowered three fences and had a refusal, leaving the New Zealand Olympic three-day event gold medallist without the <tag "537044">slightest</> enthusiasm for this type of contest.   

800332
Thus Christmas Island (105 &degree. E) is seven time zones to the east and jamaica (75 &degree. W) is five time zones to the west. 
But be warned, not all countries abide exactly by these rules, and so <tag "537043">slight</> regional modifications are quite common. 

800333
You must feel completely shattered by what you found out, but I wonder why your mother didn't alert you to the facts sooner. 
Surely, if they'd had the <tag "537044">slightest</> suspicion about what was happening, your parents would have checked things out before?   

800334
After every census, the bureau conducts its own internal estimate of how many people it missed: in 1980 it thought it had missed 1.4% of the population, including 5-6% of blacks (and perhaps as many as 18% of black males). 
This was made worse by a <tag "537043">slight</> over-count of whites &dash. people with two homes, for instance, tended to be double-counted. 

800335
This only serves to highlight lines. 
Instead, emphasise the outer corner of the eye by brushing dark powder eye-shadow close to the edge of the upper and lower lids. 
Matt eyeshadows or those with just a <tag "537043">slight</> sheen work best on the over-40s.   

800336
`Let me help." 
In silence they spread the linen upon the bed, tucked in the corners neatly, dropped the pillows into their cases, extended the quilt When they returned to the kitchen Franca said, with a <tag "537043">slight</> tone of insistence, `Thank you so much.   

800337
It was found that the stall warning detector microswitch was intermittent in operation. 
Strip examination revealed that this was the result of <tag "537043">slight</> corrosion on the contacts, and the evidence suggested that this may well have been present at the time of the accident. 

800338
Among those who turned down the part of the domineering Nurse Ratched, for example, were Anne Bancroft, Jane Fonda &dash. `I'm still fed up with people telling me how good Jack Nicholson is" &dash. and Faye Dunaway. 
Nicholson had not the <tag "537044">slightest</> concern about image; this was not a film to promote him as a romantic idol.   

800339
One goal down, United should have been chasing the game yet for the first 25 minutes of the second half they were running around getting nowhere. 
For the final 20 minutes Durnin and Byrne were replaced by David Penney and Phil Heath and the change appeared to lift United out of first gear and into second. 
And Penney it was who at last forced a save with a 20 yard shot which took a <tag "537043">slight</> deflection off a defender but was still comfortably dealt with by Baker.   

800340
Jochen Mass, after a fine middle shift by his co-driver Michael Schumacher, was leading the race by 42secs with 15 laps to go, when a sudden rain shower sent the drivers scurrying to the pits for grooved tyres. 
Mass, the most accomplished veteran of Sportscar racing, was just passing the pits entrance when the <tag "537043">slight</> drizzle turned into a downpour: he had a torrid time out there on Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, spending almost 3 minutes slithering around to the pits.   

800341
Thus in the short, medium and long term, to help Poland is to help Germany. 
It is only a <tag "537043">slight</> exaggeration to say that, at this extraordinary historical moment, the future of Poland depends on the Germans; the future of Europe depends on each behaving a little more like the other.   

800342
The estimates showed that the third quarter current account deficit deteriorated to #6.5bn and brought the shortfall for the first nine months to #16.16bn. 
As a result future assumptions for the monthly surplus on invisibles &dash. EC transfers, investment income from abroad and overseas earnings from financial and other services &dash. may be lowered. 
The figures also disclosed a <tag "537043">slight</> weakening in overseas receipts from shipping and civil aviation. 

800343
Very clever, and very pleasing on the tongue. 
A consomme of chicken was served in a silver dish with a dusting of tiny vegetable dice, a chicken breast and ravioli containing wild mushrooms, a dainty dish. 
A grey-legged partidge had great succulence and the <tag "537044">slightest</> tinge of decay.

He felt shy at the thought of another encounter, and a little alarmed at the idea of being cloistered with one person. 
Toby, whose parents lived in north London, had been at a day school, which gave him a <tag "537043">slight</> sense of inferiority together with a thoroughly romantic conception of community life.   

800345
It was an office he achieved in 1957. 
He is remembered as a brilliant debater: friends regarded him as a Labour leader in the making. 
Characterised by enormous fluency, wit and mental agility, which negated his <tag "537043">slight</> speech impediment, he could pick off visiting politicians with the same ease he dispatched contemporaries such as Michael Heseltine, Jeremy Isaacs, Anthony Howard, Peter Brooke, Peter Jay and Philip Whitehead.

For the uninitiated, this means that from 1500 feet will get you around four to five miles to play with depending on wind. 
The only thing that I noticed which would annoy me if I were a glider pilot was that, engine off, the propeller does have a habit of rotating slightly. 
With the blade in a vertical position, it interrupts the air flow, which seemed to cause some <tag "537043">slight</> aerodynamic disturbance over the elevators.

But pedestrian casualties rose slightly &dash. 1,753 deaths in 1988 compared with 1,703 in 1987. 
Deaths among car-users were down but serious injuries and <tag "537043">slight</> injuries to car-users rose.

Read today, its contemporary references seem crude and dead as mutton. 
Anyone can work out who the `subspecies" Marxomanni, Mussolimini and Swastici are meant to represent, but they do not really play an important part in the story, since we can feel that John, the Pilgrim, is not really tempted or overwhelmed by them, any more than Lewis ever felt the <tag "537044">slightest</> inclination to become a Maminst or a Fascist.

I don't know if you remember Rolling Stone during that period 
he started getting <tag "537043?">slight</>, not really new wave,

The spiral and the helix are not symmetrical. 
Symmetry can be used to convert a unidimensional vector into a two or three dimensional truss. 
For example, gravity can be opposed by a single, vertical prop but the <tag "537044">slightest</> eccentricity will cause it to gyrate and buckle.

This is not the nasty piece of work of Paradise Postponed. 
He can still pull an exceptionally dirty trick; he still has the hide of a rhino except to real and imagined patronising <tag "537047">slights</>; but Titmuss has mellowed.

He was wearing a light suit and a very jazzy tie. 
`Hawaiian," Mr Gogarty said with a <tag "537043">slight</> sneer, declaring how money betrays on a man's puss. 

800355
It was strange, but the thought of her sister marrying one of those terrible Feltons no longer filled her with abhorrence; far better that than bring a child into the world that wasn't wanted and whom her mother had already thrown off for adoption. 
She was brought back to her mother's voice, as though enticing her, yet with a <tag "537043">slight</> sneer in it now, saying, `It would give you an opportunity to wear some of those clothes you've been spending your money on lately."

Similarly, other experts say that the peak in testosterone which happens in women around mid-cycle when they are ovulating &dash. and the very time they are likely to get pregnant &dash. is very <tag "537043">slight</> and unlikely to result in your pursuing your mate with greater passion.

`You know, the only ambition she ever had for me was to marry well and bring up the colour of the family." 
Unconsciously she patted the <tag "537043">slight</> swelling of her stomach under her smart new navy-blue smock.   

800358
She had, lately, almost come to this point with Gildas, but had checked herself in time. 
She was less close to Gildas, whom she regarded with some <tag "537043">slight</> awe, for she feared his irony and his sharp tongue, and would not have allowed him the slightest `liberty" had he not cleverly, for he was very clever, `set up" a conversation which led her, through a series of exchanges, into the danger area.

The baiting and maintenance grant from Thames Water is not adequate, the council says. 
Thames Water denies that funds are too low to cope with the rats: `There is a <tag "537043">slight</> increase in numbers, and the money is sufficient."

Some doors respond very well, but others tend to open at the seams. 
Sometimes the wood  revealed is all different colours, as the door was never intended to be seen naked, but hidden by primer, undercoat and top coat. 
A <tag "537043">slight</> variation of wood colour is no great problem, as the wood can be bleached prior to  finishing with stain and seal.

Falkirk W) protested. 
He said a new 25-millilitre measure introduced to replace the existing choice of measures `normally a quarter or a fifth of a gill in Scotland and a sixth of a gill in England" was `a <tag "537043">slight</> increase in the normal measures served in an English pub but a decrease of about 12 per cent in the average measure in a Scottish pub". 

800362
But back to the race itself. 
Prince, trained by Mike Compton at Belle Vue, has come within a whisker of Fearless Ace's track record in his last two blistering runs, and on paper must be one of the biggest certainties for the race in a long while. 
However, as any race-goer will know, the <tag "537044">slightest</> bump, or slack trapping can turn form inside out.

After all, a Frenchman has good cause to do so, hasn't he?" 
There was a moment of <tag "537043">slight</> awkwardness as Mr Lewis glanced around the table.

BRAZILIAN driver Mauricio Gugelmin (left) suspended in mid-air after bouncing off Thierry Boutsen's Williams car and cannoning into Nigel Mansell's Ferrari at the start of the French Formula One grand prix at Le Castellet yesterday. 
Gugelmin, remarkably, escaped unharmed and Mansell went on to finish second, despite suffering <tag "537043">slight</> neck and head injuries.

The East German leadership at last showed some reaction to the enormous vote of no confidence expressed by its citizens over the past weeks. 
The Politburo issued a statement regretting for the first time the mass exodus to the West. 
It even admitted that there were `problems" &dash. a <tag "537043">slight</> euphemism, given the tens of thousands of people who had attended mass protests up and down the country &dash. and hinted that the government might be to blame. 

800368
Well presumably you haven't played at all in the last couple of weeks, so it's &ellip. so you're feeling perhaps a little bit rusty about it all? 
Rusty in the fact that {vocal sound="um"} we haven't been able to sort of {vocal sound="um"} get out on the field with a ball in our hand, {vocal sound="um"} but {vocal sound="um"} our coach {vocal sound="um"} Ian McMillan has taken the opportunity to drag us into the gym and give us quite {vocal sound="um"} hard fitness sessions, so the fitness is still {vocal sound="um"} quite high on our side, but {vocal sound="um"} handling the ball will be a little bit rusty, but hopefully this week, now all the snow's gone, we'll be able to get out and {vocal sound="um"} move the ball about at training. 
There was a <tag "537043?">slight</> match at Twickenham this afternoon; England against Scotland &ellip

The main Wealh's Restaurant was given a major refit last summer and new manager Jim Smith is working hard to promote it as not only a `special occasions" place to eat, but an establishment with a lively table d'hote that changes daily and is good value for a three star establishment, at #13.75 for lunch and #16.50 in the evening. 
The table d'hote is available seven days a week, with the exception of Sunday lunchtimes, when there is a <tag "537043">slight</> change of format, with a traditional roast meal featuring price #11.75.   

800372
The subsequent sale of the Woodhead spring manufacturing business to Hoesch of Germany for nearly #22 million has transformed the financial position and opens the way to potentially more successful smaller acquisitions in specialist engineering. 
The <tag "537043">slight</> increase in turnover conceals a 13 per cent advance to #68 million in the sales of continuing activities, although profit rose #210,000 to #8.8 million.

I owed all my knowledge and awareness of colors to Patty. 
Indeed, that morning when the Bug was a few weeks old and I had walked into the kitchen holding the handful of inspection slips and said what beautiful colors they were, I had been conscious of a <tag "537043">slight</> sense of trying out the idea that the colors themselves could be the quality of the slips that gave me pleasure, and not the coloristically drab but procedurally engrossing production line of clothes manufacturing they implied; and aware also of wanting to prove to Patty that I was making progress in my ability to find things in the world that she would like, and bring them to her as gifts.   

800374
The assertion was almost certainly untrue, to the extent that any untested assertion can be so described. 
Apart from anything else, there was never at any time the <tag "537044">slightest</> chance that the United States would cooperate in any action.   

800375
At the weekends, we are no longer constrained by the timetable of our weekdays and we may have a fuller social life in the evening. 
Bearing in mind also that our body clock tends to run slow at the weekend, we will tend to have later nights and lie-ins, all of which cause a <tag "537043">slight</> delay of our body clock.

Reichslinger replied. 
There was a <tag "537043">slight</> pause, his boots crunched in the gravel again, and, imagining him to be walking away, she glanced up cautiously.

`His best wins have all been away from home," said Eastwood. 
`I always feel he has a <tag "537043">slight</> fear about fighting here." 

800378
How could he ever have imagined a dialogue with kids young enough to be his grandchildren? 
And, would not the <tag "537044">slightest</> measure of press freedom have brought this palace of lies down in total ruin?   

800379
Like the other leaders, he played down the possibility of the Soviet Union joining the seven, saying it was not yet a democracy. 
Mrs Thatcher, denying that she had suffered any <tag "537047">slight</> at the hands of her French hosts or that she had dealt one, said the summit had been excellent and she could not remember another such occasion `where the spirit had been better" or where there had been a greater consensus on key issues.

A second or third attempt is well worthwhile &dash. keep on trying! 
Your health may be slightly below-par, so don't burn the candle at both ends.

Some have a balcony. 
This pleasant hotel is built on a <tag "537043">slight</> rise, and has excellent views of the mountains behind it and down to the village in front.   

800382
There were, not surprisingly, some who were willing to put a less reputable interpretation on the fact of this respectable-looking gentleman travelling and living abroad with a much younger woman who, with her smart clothes, was `a little glamorous amongst the hard-working, aggressively tough `Sabras" of her age in Israel," but I know of nothing to support that view. 
Herbert's papers do give a <tag "537043">slight</> hint that he rather enjoyed letting people think the worst. 

800384
Both men were very drunk and had already been involved in two violent incidents. 
An hour earlier, Boxer had punched a man for calling him a `fascist bastard" and soon after the two men had brandished knives at a group of men outside a pub and demanded money from some others. 
At a <tag "537043">slight</> distance from each other, Scouller and Carroll crossed the road diagonally toward the man they had seen coming in their direction.

The duo are likely to be kept apart until the Festival. 
Beech Road is set to begin his year in Newcastle's Fighting Fifth, with the Gerry Feilden Hurdle at Newbury pencilled in for Morley Street's seasonal debut &dash. both a week on Saturday. 
At the outset of a season which promises much for his Hampshire yard, Balding's <tag "537043">slight</> preference is for the champion.

Northamptonshire County Council proposes to build the bypass and improve the section of the A422 road by Overthorpe Hall, a preparatory day school on the outskirts of the village. 
The county council has made it a priority to build the bypass because of the amount of accidents which have taken place in and around Middleton Cheney. 
In the five years between January 1984 and January 1988 there were 49 traffic accidents involving personal injury on this particular length of the A422, resulting in 18 serious and 65 <tag "537043">slight</> casualties.

`Graciela knows everybody who is anybody in television," Camardi said.

The sky was a steady blue, washing paler towards the horizons, and a line of small rotund clouds was stretched above the trees which secluded the Abbey from view. 
The lake was a brilliant yet gentle colour of which it was hard to say whether it was a light blue or an extremely luminous grey. 
A <tag "537043">slight</> warm breeze took the edge off the heat. 

800390
For a short time they had existed for her diversion, but now they would be set before her as judges. 
Her acquaintance with them in the railway carriage had been something <tag "537043">slight</> and fragile but at least innocent.   

800391
The angels promenaded in neat and pleasing lines, three witches cavorted wildly for a brief moment, and some of the singers were given a few simple but effective steps. 
I did not see the production until the following Christmas, when it contained an amusing touch which I imagine John must have added that year, after Leonide Massine had revived The Three-cornered Hat at Covent Garden: Hansel and Gretel danced a few steps with a bunch of grapes, a good-humoured quotation from the dance of the miller and his wife in Massine's ballet. 
His first real ballet for the company was also <tag "537043">slight</>.

Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrats' leader, will frequently be forced to rely on the Welsh and Scottish Nationalists for helpful background reaction. 
Neil Kinnock's own doughnut includes a generous expanse of Roy Hattersley, and is unlikely to pose any serious problems. 
But Sir Geoffrey Howe, the deputy prime minister, betrayed a <tag "537043">slight</> lapse on Tuesday, the first day of the television `experiment".   

800393
Did it ever occur to you that it just isn't good enough?" 
Serena's face could have been modelled by Gustav Klimt; high cheekbones (higher than any Eskimo's), a confrontational stare and an accusatory manner under teeth which could have flattered a merry-go-round horse. 
Outside the family she spoke with a <tag "537043">slight</> but inlocatable accent, hauntingly similar to the speech of the late Leopold Stokowski whose phonetic origins could be variously and simultaneously traced to Lodz, Poland; rural Albania; Kilmoganny, Ireland, and an enclave in the northern section of Tokyo.

Someone had suggested that George should simply write an Introduction. 
I said I had of course not the <tag "537044">slightest</> objection to that.   

800396
Yet that in a way is what you would expect. 
Unemployment is inevitably a lagging indicator and despite the continued fall you can just see signs of a <tag "537043">slight</> deceleration. 

800397
This last is important, as the continuing chain of world events have illustrated. 
Jews are always on the qui-vive, sensitive to the <tag "537044">slightest</> nuance of social change, aware of outside threat even before it happens, and in their souls they must always be ready to pack up and leave, to make a new beginning elsewhere.   

800398
Even then he seemed in two minds whether to disembark before he had reached his goal, and embroider the theme still further. 
However, after a <tag "537043">slight</> struggle, he decided not to indulge his fancy and, as the bus rolled away, there was a final wave of the hand and a farewell injunction not to forget the open sesame: high technology.   

800399
Indeed, its very lack of a progressive element is one of its attractions to anyone who considers that even the faintest trace of a leaning towards greater equality is an offence against the laws of economics. 
By entrusting the defence of the poll tax to the triumphalist sneering of Mr Ridley on the one hand, and the priggish zeal of Mr Gummer on the other, Mrs Thatcher shows how <tag "537043">slight</> is her concern for that aspect of the matter, and how indifferent she is to the fears of good judges in her party that this issue still has the power to do untold damage at the election.

The situation over the community is worse, however, with roughly half of all waste escaping without any purification. 
Low-level nuclear waste discharges into the Irish Sea from Sellafield have fallen for the eighth successive year, according to a report published by British Nuclear Fuels yesterday. 
The reduction in 1988 was <tag "537043">slight</>, following previous `dramatic decreases".

800402
Approval of capital projects took between four months and 42 months. 
THE RAPID GROWTH in government and commercial donations to voluntary organisations has stopped, a survey of charitable giving said yesterday. 
The <tag "537043">slight</> decline in contributions throws ministers' plans for `active citizens" in charities to substantially expand services for the needy into doubt.   

800403
The League for Democracy's executive committee was meeting on June 1st to write a letter to the State Council suggesting an agenda for consultations. 
It has three main items: the new constitution; the release of the party's leaders; and the role of the army under a civilian regime. 
The League wants the constitution that was written in 1947 for independence from Britain to be reintroduced with <tag "537043">slight</> changes. 

800404
Mr Gerasimov even managed a joke on the issue. 
`I draw your attention to the song of Frank Sinatra, `They had it their way"," he said, unaware of his <tag "537043">slight</> error with the song's title.   

800405
He did not need to be very charming. 
They had learned to accept him in all his humours: they were grateful for anything short of his worst moods, inordinately grateful for the <tag "537044">slightest</> goodwill, what they barely would have accepted from an equal.
