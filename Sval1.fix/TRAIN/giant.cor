But for London's financial services industry the sale of Morgan Grenfell is another gamble that failed. 
Those energetic and persuasive people who drove Morgan Grenfell to its float, built up its securities side, and pushed the rules of corporate finance to the limits, have lost.

This could be difficult with a large company like its US insurance subsidiary, Farmers.

Several of the smaller companies were attempting to launch production yachts which, they hoped, would blossom into strong one-design classes.

Johnson hit the first of four second-half three-pointers, 6ft 7in Chris Kearney began to use his muscle while England international Dave Gardner found his range. 
Giants went ahead at 69-67 through Johnson and as the momentum swung away from the Finns, overall victory suddenly seemed a possibility. 
Johnson's fourth three-pointer and two shots from Gardner put Giants 80-75 ahead, but then Baskerville Holmes found Gerald Lee unmarked under <tag "530187">Giants'</> basket and the home team needed to find another four points.

Thomson is one of the few defence companies, along with General Electric, which over the last few years has been busily restructuring itself for tougher times. 
By going on the acquisition and joint-venture trail it has been able to maintain and improve its worldwide position. 
The purchase of Philips's defence operation and the creation of Sextant Avionique which is the merger between Thomson and Aerospatiale's avionics activities will put it right in line with the other emerging European <tag "530183">giants</> such as GEC, Siemens, Plessey and MBB Daimler Benz.

Saatchi &and.

Representative Les AuCoin, a liberal Democrat from Oregon, who is a strong supporter of abortion rights, said yesterday that past votes on such issues as federal funding for abortion suggested that opponents of abortion had a majority of about 50 votes in the lower House of Congress. 
The pro-abortion lobby was looking hopefully, but perhaps desperately, at that 50 per cent of the adult population which does not vote. 
Overwhelmingly, the non-voters are the poor, the disadvantaged and minority groups and abortion might be an issue to radicalise what one activist called `the sleeping <tag "530300">giant</>" into voting.

The biologist Charles Darwin, who arrived in 1835 on his expedition aboard The Beagle, described the islands as `a little world within itself" and `a living laboratory of evolution". 
His studies on the wildlife, how it had adapted to the unusual volcanic conditions, and how the same animals had different markings on different islands, led him to formulate his theory of `survival of the fittest", which is the basis of his book The Origin of Species. 
After this, other scientists began to remove animals and plants for research, upsetting the balance of nature to the extent that the <tag "530266">giant</> turtles have only survived on two of the islands.

As a response to these accidents, Oxford City Council is staging a Kitchen Safety Week to highlight the dangers and to advise people to take precautions. 
The week, from Sunday until Saturday July 28, will feature a giant kitchen to show a child's eye view of the dangers.

John Roper, of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, warned that economic failure combined with growing nationalistic fervour in some East European and Third World countries could lead instead to the emergence of extremely right-wing, authoritarian regimes. 
He told the conference &dash. which is considering future world political, economic, social, scientific and environmental trends &dash. that with the relative decline in the economic importance of the United States and the diminishing military threat posed by the Soviet Union, the new civil super powers of the 1990s were likely to be Japan and Western Europe. 
While the Cold War evaporated as Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, realised that there was little point in the USSR being a military <tag "530300">giant</> if it remained an `economic pygmy", the world would not, Mr Roper said, necessarily become a safer place.

The US version of The Green Consumer Guide, written by Joel Makower and published in April 1990, appeared to have a ready audience. 
And in Canada, research done for the supermarket-chain <tag "530184">giant</> Loblaw as they planned to launch a green product campaign found that half of all consumers would switch to a store selling merchandise they believe to be environmentally safe.

That's what the Blue Jays said, too. 
And then there is the hypothesis put to the A's Tony La Russa, the lawyer-manager and quiet ringmaster of what can be a wild Oakland circus troupe: `What do you do if Will Clark (the <tag "530187">Giants</> big-hitting first baseman) comes to the plate with the bases loaded?"

Last night the Giants, their neighbours from across the San Francisco Bay, sealed the National League championship series against the Chicago Cubs, winning 3-2 to complete a 4-1 victory and take their first pennant for 27 years. 
The odds had turned towards the Giants on Sunday after a 6-4 win at Candlestick Park. 
Matt Williams seized on some poor Cubs pitching to drive in four of the <tag "530187">Giants</> runs and Will Clark lifting his series batting average to .625 when he reached base on three of his four at-bats.   

800271
A City presentation by the US brewing group, Anheuser-Busch, also helped sentiment, although there was no suggestion that A-B had its sights set on any British brewer. 
Cadbury romped ahead 15p to 354p on revived talk that the US General Cinema had sold its near 16 per cent interest to a lurking predator, said to be Continental, and probably BSN, the aggressive French food and drink <tag "530183">giant</>.

Threat to insurers AS THE #1.1bn takeover bid by Australian Mutual Provident, Australia's largest life insurer, gets underway for the Pearl Group, a new survey suggests that perhaps the Australians should have made a bid for a building society. 
The survey, prepared by the <tag "530184">giant</> reinsurance group Swiss Re, shows that building societies pose a growing threat to insurance companies.  

800278
All sorts of debris was scattered in profusion. 
A multitude of household effects, iron bars, timbers, glass, bricks, a chimney stack, seemed to have been shaken by some <tag "530184">giant</> hand and strewn any which way Maggie came upon a pile of massive boulders, which had been swept down off the hills.

But even in those days there were problems with transport. 
For years the dominating feature of the placid landscape of the Cherwell Valley to the north of Oxford, has been `Smoky Joe", as the <tag "530184">giant</> chimney of the cement works of Shipton-on-Cherwell is familiarly known, soaring 250ft into the air &dash. the most conspicuous landmark for miles, and often used by aircraft pilots to get their bearings.

Next door, Paul Farnham's display is in contrast. 
Stark metal pieces, a <tag "530184">giant</> gazebo, French garden chairs, an urn (all in a white-painted room-setting) give a stagey Chekhovian look that decorators like.   

800282
Of these, an equity injection seems the most likely, with Mr Goward saying he would be prepared to see his 25 per cent stake in Westmex diluted if institutions were prepared to inject equity. 
One institution unlikely to support Westmex would be the <tag "530184">giant</> Australian Mutual Provident Society, which recently took over Pearl Assurance.

But that proved no deterrent. 
Even before the cortege arrived, led by a <tag "530184">giant</> portrait of Dr Sakharov and followed by a grey bus with black curtained windows containing his mortal remains, perhaps 50,000 people had assembled on the esplanade, among them a dozen or more Western ambassadors, including those of the United States and Britain.

The royal family persistently talks in the `common good" language of the fifties so unfashionable among those who held power throughout the eighties. 
Certain themes run through pronouncements by all members of the family &dash. interest in national unity; worries about the environment, from Prince Charles's confrontations with modern architects to Prince Philip's affection for the <tag "530266">giant</> panda; concern about family life, at home in the Inner Cities or overseas through the Save the Children Fund.   

800291
Then a foul by Gardner sent Clyde Vaughan to the line, and he scored both shots to regain the lead for Sunderland at 87-86 and take his total to 30 points. 
Sunderland needed one more basket to force overtime, but the Giants' 6ft 8in American Kris Kearney drove through Sunderland's defence to give his team victory in both legs. 
<tag "530187">Giants</> have won all five meetings against Sunderland this season, but none of them by more than six points.

Apparently, they think we should get, say, five of the 12 stores."

Nor is it suggested that the smallholder should revert to primitive subsistence living, although he may need to give up some of the consumer society's more expensive luxuries. 
Co-operation with neighbours is the key to successful smallholding. 
It is a matter of scale; of working with like-minded, self-employed farmers and craftsmen rather than of subservience to faceless officials and <tag "530184">giant</> firms.

And then the Phalange killed him too. 
When Bashir Gemayel's own baby daughter was killed in a car bomb attempt on his life in east Beirut, Suleiman Franjieh, who was now secluded in his home town of Zghorta under the protection of his Marada (<tag "999997">Giants</>) militia, could scarcely suppress his satisfaction.

It was important to pass the examination &dash. and not only that, but to be near the top of the list in order to be assured of getting through the door of the right secondary school. 
Boys who did not, remained in the elementary-school system (in, as will appear, most cases) to linger on like dispossessed <tag "530300">giants</> until the system and my grandfather let go of them at the age of fourteen.   

800301
Instead Saunders replied with nine points in the final three minutes. 
Sunderland were without their England guard Stevenson for the third game since he damaged an ankle in training and, with fireman Colin Kirkham on duty on Wearside, their bench lacked depth. 
Sunderland's Clyde Vaughan was the first half's leading scorer with 16 points, but it took Saunders' first successful three-pointer out of five attempts to cut <tag "530187">Giants'</> interval lead to 51-46. 

800302
These need to be probed in the weeks ahead. 
AHOST of Britain's leading companies were yesterday thrown into the takeover spotlight following the #13 billion assault on tobacco, retailing and financial services <tag "530183">giant</> BAT Industries.

After the massacre of Tiananmen Square, even this model is going through a bad patch. 
China's decision to surge ahead with economic reform before taking the <tag "530184">giant</> risk of political democratisation these days seems even less inviting than Gorbachev's policy of Glasnost now, and Perestroika later.

Yorkshire Water has declined to comment but is believed to be refusing to accept liability.

It follows that even if the rate of eruption of Olympus Mons was as little  as 0.1 kilometers cubed of lava per year (the same rate as that of the  Hawaiian volcanoes), the cumulative effect would be that the volcanoes kept  on and on growing, leading to the huge structures that we observe today. 
One difficulty in this kind of hypothesizing about the <tag "530184">giant</> Martian  volcanoes is that it is difficult to be certain just how old they are, and  for how long they have been active.   

800311
There are neat marinas where trips can be taken on pleasure boats, and one can go sailing, surfing, or canoeing (but not bathing: the water is still too dirty).

800318
This time, the catcher, Terry Steinbach, who had got La Russa's nod ahead of Ron Hassey, came up to bat, still in the fourth inning, with two men on base. 
The Giants' starting pitcher, Rick `Big Daddy" Reuschel, suddenly turned sugar daddy as Steinbach deposited a pitch high over the left-field wall. 
That made it 5-1, Rickey Henderson having put the put the A's on the board in the first inning, scoring on a Carney Lansford double, and Jose Uribe registering the <tag "530187">Giants'</> only run of the Series in the third after a Robby Thompson sacrifice fly.

Because they were worried about imitators, RKO studios were deliberately spreading a lot of misleading information about the film. 
They suggested that it was a <tag "530184">giant</> robot, and Popular Mechanics magazine had an article showing a huge gorilla tramping through the jungles with wires coming out of it, and down in the corner was a organ with a little man playing its keyboard to make the robot move.

Sunderland, who lost 98-95 at Manchester two weeks ago, fought back from 15 points down at the interval to take the lead for the first time three minutes from the end when Terry Manghum's tip-in put them 85-84 ahead.

Pino's, in Caerphilly, is typical. 
The black and white tiled floor is cracked, and the shelves and furniture look worn. 
A few housewives with prams natter over tea, but otherwise Pino's is dusty and quiet, with nothing but a <tag "530184">giant</> hissing tea urn to listen to.

Regarded as the third Saatchi brother when he was finance director of their advertising group, Martin Sorrell decided to branch out on his own in 1985. 
Buying a small Kent engineering company, Wire &and. Plastic Products, (WPP) he went on to create an advertising group to rival the Saatchis, with two <tag "530184">giant</> American takeovers in 1987 and 1989.

Soft soil consistencies and poor construction exacerbated the earthquakes in Armenia last year, in which 25,000 people died, and in Mexico City in 1985, in which 8,000 people died. 
I WAS on the upper deck of Candlestick Park when the quake struck.

Malik has for some time been one of the world's outstanding batsmen and it was his 66 off 41 balls (six fours, three sixes) that inspired the hitherto pedestrian Rameez (85 off 82 balls) to match him virtually blow for blow. 
Whatever discomforts England might have been expecting in Nagpur, arriving on India's equivalent of bonfire night and discovering that the bangers here are more like hand grenades was not one of them.

This year's International Money Show which will be opened tomorrow at noon by Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Group, is a must for all who takes managing their financial affairs seriously.

`The Devoted Friend" and `The Remarkable Rocket" take more personal themes: friendship betrayed and overwheening vanity &dash. both matters of which Wilde had some experience. 
In P J Lynch's water-colours, the Selfish <tag "530189-p">Giant's</> Castle shrouded in chilly wraiths, the grim underworld below the Happy Prince's pedestal and the wittily characterised fireworks in `The Remarkable Rocket" (above) all conjure up richly coloured worlds that children will look long on.

Attempts by both India and China to open their economies in the 1980s have resulted in a tug-of-war between their economic liberals and economic conservatives, which shows every sign of ending either in stalemate or in a victory for the conservatives. 
If these richly-endowed <tag "530280">giants</> of the developing world are barely equal to the task of liberalization, Africa is much less equipped for the challenge, and much less prepared to face it.

In its absence, the Wallenberg enigma has persisted. 
For 20 years after 1957, reports of `an old Swedish prisoner" somewhere in the <tag "530184">giant</> Soviet penal camp system would reach the West.

The final run count &dash. 32-14 in the A's favour &dash. made this the most lop-sided Fall Classic since Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig's Yankees swept the Chicago Cubs, also by an 18-run margin, in 1932. 
The <tag "530187">Giants</> might as well have crept out of their dug-out with their hands up after the final out on Saturday.

Mikhail Gorbachev begins a visit to Finland on Wednesday, and makes a set-piece speech at the Finlandia House on the following day. 
He will no doubt touch on the special relationship of this small, non-communist country with its <tag "530184">giant</> neighbour, and will be listened to carefully in the nearby Soviet Baltic states.

Johnson hit the first of four second-half three-pointers, 6ft 7in Chris Kearney began to use his muscle while England international Dave Gardner found his range. 
<tag "530187">Giants</> went ahead at 69-67 through Johnson and as the momentum swung away from the Finns, overall victory suddenly seemed a possibility.

They are good judges, but somewhere along the way the odds will count for nothing.

But it has taken a move to Ferrari for him to round off the process &dash. ironic, really, in view of the number of drivers from days gone by whose careers have foundered on the rocks of intrigue at Maranello. 
Benetton and Ford must also have breathed a joint sigh of relief at the performance of their new car in the hands of Alessandro Nannini. 
Ford's hopes of competing successfully against their fellow motor industry <tag "530183">giants</> Honda and Renault have centred round the development of an extremely compact and lightweight V8 engine built by their long-time collaborators Cosworth Engineering.

On the metalled road he expected at any time to be overtaken by a police car. 
The wild sequence of imaginary scenes resumed, showing him the car slowing to disgorge questioning figures in uniform who were not satisfied until he was in a police station and confessing he was the missing yachtsman, John Gower, not gulped down by a <tag "530184">giant</> plughole but deceiving his publishers and readers while hiding in a New Forest cottage where a boy had been murdered.

For many children the trip to the panto is the first contact with the theatre.

I believe that this is as much a matter of teaching style as of a correct single method (it is also a matter of the `ear" and sensitivity to language of individual pupils). 
Some teachers may be adept at introducing their pupils to grammatical concepts, or matters of punctuation, by means of jokes and puns which depend on ambiguities, to be cleared up only by distinguishing nouns from adjectives, or different spellings of the same word (`<tag "530184">Giant</> Waves Down funnel"; `Gladly the Cross I'd bear" = `Gladly, the cross-eyed bear", and other well-known punning equivalents, beloved of all children).

The answer, I'm confident, is no. 
There are good ground rules for this type of funding, which boil down to the sponsor getting the kudos (and perhaps his name over the door &dash. the new gallery, Food for Thought, is to be sub-titled, or perhaps sur-titled, The Sainsbury Gallery) but with the curator doing what he likes with the money.

Producers of Westerns use this rugged kind of landscape almost routinely  to provide `authentic" atmosphere for their almost routine creations.

For this portico, though designed in the manner for porches attached to buildings, is by virtue of its starkly isolated position a genuine military arc de triomphe." 
Its demolition in 1962, still the most wanton act of vandalic savagery in what has become a century of architectural barbarism, signalled conclusively the end of the age of <tag "530300">giants</> and the arrival of the age of pygmies.

In the agricultural sector, the self-interest of the state has led to policies which have favoured distorted exchange rates, consistently favouring government and the urban population at the expense of the incomes of rural families, and ultimately at the expense of marketed production. 
<tag "530184">Giant</> and inefficient marketing boards have had the opposite effect of their nominal purpose, and have further squeezed farmers' margins.

I MUST confess there were small regrets when the nurse dumped a screaming bundle of babyhood in my arms and announced that I was the father of another daughter. 
Until that moment, I had cherished a secret hope that this one might be the new England fast bowler, the centre-forward whom the Brazilians raved about or the tennis player who had the crowds singing `Rule Britannia" at Wimbledon. 
It was several weeks before it struck me that Fleur could equally be the sprinter to leave those muscly American women trailing in her wake; or the Briton to take all the <tag "530369">giant</> slalom titles; or even the first home player since Virginia Wade to clean up at Wimbledon.

He wouldn't tell them anything more, but drove by tiny back roads, through impossibly steep villages to the grotesque gardens of Bomarzo. 
He had scarcely known Maggie, could not have known that he could not have chosen a better treat than this mysterious park, with its vast statues carved out of the living rock: the huge-mouthed cave with its mighty teeth, the vast stone <tag "530189">giant</>, his shoulders visible through bushes a hundred yards away, half hidden in greenery; and above all, the great carved stone dragon with its broken wings, and wild Chinese eyes.

`No-one was sufficiently perceptive to forecast the state of the market in 1989, 1990 and possibly 1991," he said. 
The Pru admits that it has ploughed so much money into the business and incurred such huge losses that even a spectacular revival could not ensure an adequate return.

One wreath came from People's Daily, the official mouthpiece of the central committee; another from the Communist Youth League, the training ground for China's future elite. 
Students from the Central Institute of Fine Art paraded into the square carrying a <tag "530184">giant</> black-and-white portrait of Hu, which they hoisted atop the granite pedestal of the Heroes' Monument, from where it stared out unflinchingly towards the portrait of Mao on Tiananmen Gate.

The atmosphere must be right in the arena and the whole event must be properly produced and co-ordinated. 
Individuals doing their own thing does not work, as Jacques Chirac found out at a 1988 Paris rally. 
There was lots of very French glitz and glamour and an apparently unlimited budget, much of which had been spent on <tag "530184">giant</> television screens and clever use of lights; but it was all quite impractical and unco-ordinated.

At least this time the Giants made a fight of it. 
After Oakland had opened up an 8-0 lead by the sixth, Kevin Mitchell rallied his team with a two-run homer in the bottom of the inning, four more runs followed in the seventh and Mitchell himself came within five feet of tying the game when his long drive was caught just shy of the fence. 
In the bleachers a placard went up &dash. `Ask Yogi, It Ain't Over Till It's Over" &dash. but the <tag "530187">Giants</> promptly ensured that it was when their relief pitcher Steve Bedrosian gifted the Athletics an insurance run in the eighth when he walked Terry Steinbach with the bases loaded.

For years they traded at parity, partly because the group was considered totally takeover proof and because one family member was a steady seller of `B" shares. 
The selling has dried up, the climate of opinion about the brewers' political and economic power has shifted against the <tag "530183">giants</> and there has been some buying of the shares on the grounds that something might happen, or even be made to happen.

THERE has been some extraordinary legal wrangling over who will buy Texas Eastern's near $1billion parcel of offshore assets.

But these still amount to some sort of market orientation of the planned economy and fall far short of what West German investors are looking for. 
`Of course we have contingency plans in our cupboard," said Alfred Herrhausen, chairman of the <tag "530184">giant</> Deutsche Bank.

From the developer's viewpoint this is happening at the worst possible time. 
After allowing for inflation, new construction in mid-1989 was more than double its previous peak of 1973. 
Roger Squire, a director with <tag "530184">giant</> property group MEPC, agrees that the changes are coming at a bad time.

TALL buildings are making an extraordinary comeback in Britain. 
As Cesar Pelli's razzmatazz Canary Wharf Tower, all 850ft of it, rockets out of the old London docks (or what are now called `quays"), YRM, the architects, are designing a 34-storey office tower in the centre of Birmingham, Covell Matthews Wheatley is working on a 25-storey Manhattan style office block in Bishopsgate in the City of London and Ishwarbhai Mistry is designing a 40-storey block for the textile merchant and developer Roy Sandhu (scaled down from the original 60 storeys) in the heart of London's East End at Whitechapel. 
THE redevelopment of Birmingham's Bull Ring into a <tag "530184">giant</> Post-Modern shopping mall (Architecture, 11 October) will not be given the go-ahead, says David Franks, the city's assistant director of development, until a strategic planning report has been prepared by the architect and former president of the Royal Town Planning Institute, Francis Tibbald.

But on the same instrument Basie brought forward over the years Lester Young, Herschel Evans, Buddy Tate, Don Byas, Illinois Jacquet, Lucky Thompson, Wardell Gray, Lockjaw Davis, Paul Quinichette, Frank Wess, Frank Foster, Billy Mitchell and Eric Dixon amongst others. 
It is small wonder that Eric Dixon didn't stand out in such a list of tenor giants. 
In anyone else's bank he would have done, but by the time he joined the Count in 1961 most of the <tag "530184">giant</> steps on that tenor player's staircase had already been taken.

They also put in a visit to Edmonton where, last weekend, their dirt-trackers beat the North American Wolverines (non-BC Canadians, plus two Americans) 24-6. 
British Columbia, who fielded only five of the players that tackled the All Blacks, have acquitted themselves admirably in a four-day period that has seen them take on the might of the two Antipodean <tag "530185">giants</>.

In LBC's case, for example, the LBC Crown FM is going for the upmarket listener, while the medium wave service, London Talkback Radio, is pitching for the tabloid market and the dedicated followers of phone-ins. 
Capital Radio, the other UK <tag "530183">giant</> of the independents, has already split its frequencies, and before long all nine quoted independent stations are expected do so, albeit not always around the clock. 

800452
At half-time Kingston led 42-41, and they increased that to 69-62 with six and a half minutes left, only for the Giants to again pull back &dash. to 72-74 with three minutes, 43 seconds remaining. 
American Kris Kearney was the Giants best player, taking nine second-half rebounds. 
But when England international Jason Fogerty and man-of-the-match Gerry Johnson both fouled out, <tag "530187">Giants</> capitulated.

Sometimes, good teams have to play bad ones or bad teams have to play each other, and it makes sense to schedule several of these games when fewer people are paying much attention, for instance on the deciding day of baseball's World Series. 
Last Sunday might have been that day had not the earth split asunder along the San Andreas fault on Tuesday, interrupting the Series until at least next Friday and laying bare for all to see such mismatches as the Bills against the Jets, the Oilers against the Steelers and the <tag "530187">Giants</> against the Chargers.

A market three times the size of all the liberalising economies of Eastern Europe combined would suddenly be wide open.

Toads release a milky white toxin from glands behind each eye to ward off predators. 
In certain kinds of toad, especially the <tag "530184">giant</> Marine variety, this fluid contains bufotenine, a hallucinogen also found in materials such as banana skins and Indemita muscarina, the crimson spotted mushroom, immortalised by Walt Disney in his film Fantasia.

Earlier, as the festive rather than fanatical crowd of 49,385 settled into their seats, the expectation had been of a low-scoring game as batters struggled to adjust to the unfamiliar pitching from the opposite league. 
Then, after a quiet first inning, the game blew up in the <tag "530187">Giants'</> faces.   

800459
With the bowl of the Coliseum now swathed in darkness and the lights on the circling blimp blinking like a Christmas tree, the A's took out extra insurance in the next two innings with solo home runs over the right-field fence from Dave Parker and Weiss. 
By then game one was over as a contest. 
While Garrelts gave way to a series of relief men, Stewart, one of five Oakland players born in the Bay area, powered on to complete the game single-handed, striking out seven <tag "530187">Giants</> and conceding a meagre three hits in his third victory of the post-season.

This is about half an inch away from grand libel, and Dante probably had to be restrained from introducing a Mrs Clamp called Irina or Ileana. 
Almost the whole film is set in the Tower: the script flicks a stream of gags at its robotic absurdity &dash. doors that hiss open with the words `Have a powerful day" or `Mister, welcome to the MEN'S ROOM!". 
To be honest, Clamp Tower suits Dante down to the ground: all those corridors, foyers, studios and dark objects of machinery &dash. it's like a <tag "530184">giant</> movie-house, which is the only kind of terrain that he knows.

What he meant was that Dunican was the dynamo that drove the firm.

Yestertech strikes! 
From smooth-curved radio-cassettes by Sharp and deco-flavoured furniture by the Italian avant-garde, Yestertech has naturally extended to architecture, particularly in America where the post-modern totems of Michael Graves and Robert Venturi have encouraged a rash of inferior imitations.

Gower pressed back against the wall as the man glanced up. 
He knew he could not be seen, that the diamond panes prevented it, but it was instinct to draw back. 
For the postman, or any other visitor, it was equally irresistible to look up admiringly at the well-cared-for thatched roof that had been finished with ornament so precise it looked like the hand-sewing of a <tag "530300">giant</>.

This guaranteed that the water fell to the ground just clear of the walls, so protecting them against damp, discoloration and decay. 
But the utilitarian function of keeping church walls dry hardly accounts for the occasionally bizarre juxtaposition of the sacred and profane: Christ and the saints among the foully contorted and pagan fertility symbols, the Virgin Mary elbowed by <tag "530189">giants</> (usually depicted with both hands pulling back fierce lips).

Still, Denver are in a strong position thanks to a weak division and a fairly easy schedule for the rest of the season. 
At this point, the Seattle Seahawks, who won for the second straight Sunday, over the Chargers, and the Los Angeles Raiders, who beat the Washington Redskins, loom as the most likely challengers. 
Following their victories, both the Eagles and the Bears were paying close attention to last night's game between their division leaders, respectively the New York <tag "530187">Giants</> and the Minnesota Vikings.

By then Gromyko was the senior figure in the Politburo and his word must have helped to sway others such as Viktor Chebrikov, the then head of the KGB. 
(It was claimed at the time that Gromyko described Gorbachev as a man `with a nice smile but iron teeth", although there was no mention of this phrase in the published text of his remarks). 
Gorbachev soon made it clear he wanted a younger, less dominating figure as his foreign minister, and put Edward Shevardnadze in charge at the <tag "530184">giant</> Stalinist wedding-cake building which dominates Smolensky Square in Moscow.

There are some businesses where the glue is still size: in the oil business the risks and the sheer scale of operations are such that you need to be very big. 
That does not mean that oil <tag "530183">giants</> should try and run chemical companies, or own coal mines.   

800483
These were far more significant than any item projected in the development plans. 
In Zambia and Uganda, similar unplanned leaps were carried out between 1968 and 1970, placing a large number of private businesses in the public sector. 
In Zambia the government took a controlling interest in twenty-six foreign-owned companies in 1968, and acquired a major stake in the two <tag "530184">giant</> copper mining companies in 1969.

Ford is thought to have offered to take a stake in the Saab car division, which lost #77m in the first six months of this year, or help finance a new model in return for a being given a stake in the highly-profitable Scania truck business. 
The collapse of the talks leaves Ford free to concentrate on its long-term aim of taking over Jaguar, in which it already has a 10.4 per cent stake. 
Jaguar, however, is close to finalising a link-up with the rival American car <tag "530183">giant</> GM which is expected to involve GM taking a 15 per cent stake in return for making a #200m cash injection.

For international tobacco companies, the best hope of increasing sales comes from the loosening of control of state monopolies over their 60 per cent share of the world market. 
If that happens, as seems increasingly likely, the world's international tobacco <tag "530183">giants</> will have been given a few more years to prove their case: that tobacco is not a dying business.

This suited Peter Buckton and Simon Tipping admirably; they made the best possible use of the loose ball, punching holes through the Durham defence so that, as the final quarter was reached, Yorkshire led 25-6. 
Powerless to halt the irresistible Simon Irving and Paul Johnson, Howe led a spirited fightback with a try, to which Dave Cooke &dash. the best of the title holders' backs &dash. added another, but Johnson later confirmed Yorkshire's legitimate hopes of being northern group winners with a third score from the backs.

There is nothing wrong with Bass: it is an honourable and well-run brewer.

THE WEAKNESS in Grand Metropolitan's share price since it hit a record high of 657p three months ago has been a reflection more of poor communications than poor trading. 
The point was emphasised by impressive figures for the 12 months to 30 September and by the company's positive outlook on the current year. 
This trading period is the most critical in Grand Met's recent history as it will determine whether chairman and group chief executive Allen Sheppard's vision for Pillsbury, the US food <tag "530183">giant</> acquired in January for dollars 5.7bn, is an ambitious dream or profitable reality.

Thomas Edison filmed the first bodybuilding star, Eugen Sandow, in the 1890s, and specialised `physique movies" have always proliferated. 
But the real hulks' heyday was in the late Fifties and early Sixties, when Italian studios pumped out as many as 400 muscle-man epics (known as pepla, after the Greek mini-skirts the he-men used to pose in): `They always had an American star with an Elvis haircut," says Dyer.

THE FIRST broomsticks of Autumn began to appear around the Oakland Coliseum towards the end of game two of the World Series on Sunday night. 
Unless San Francisco Giants quickly remember where they left those big bats that proved so effective against Chicago Cubs in the play-offs, Candlestick Park will look like a witches' convention tomorrow night, with the Athletics celebrating the first 4-0 sweep in a Series since the Reds brushed aside the Yankees in 1976. 
After Sunday's 5-1 defeat, the <tag "530187">Giants</> may have a fading cause, but there are a couple of factors that may swing the balance of power a little towards them in windswept Candlestick tonight.

Of those 380 League matches currently being played this season, fewer then one in three have any realistic bearing on the destination of the major prize. 
If you take all Liverpool's fixtures, possibly all of Arsenal's and a few others, the remainder will prove to have been more or less academic. 
Obviously all other European nations have their <tag "530280">giants</> who are perennial title favourites too.

There is some irony in Lawrence Taylor's role in the film.

If we keep paying ourselves more than we earn without being able to adjust the currency then industry will have to embark on another bout of cost reductions which will make the 1980 bloodletting look like an injury in the nursery.

The biggest move yet into Eastern Europe by a Western firm was announced by General Electric of the US earlier this week, which is paying about dollars 150m to take a 50 per cent stake in Tungsram, the Hungarian lighting manufacturer.

They began the day with an 8-1 record, identical to that of the San Francisco 49ers.

Its popularity probably lies in the fact that it is a game which is cheap and easy to play and understand. 
You don't have to be a seven-foot <tag "530185">giant</> or a 16-stone powerhouse to succeed at it, and no `performance-enhancing" drug can convert an ordinary player into a good one.

It's clear even from this brief review that our knowledge of the other  planets is still slim. 
Of the nine planets, only the four nearest the sun,  Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are possible candidates as sites for  volcanic activity. 
The low-density, `<tag "530184">giant</>" planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are  non-starters, since their internal structures are unlikely to be capable of  sustaining the same kind of internal processes that give rise to volcanic  activity on Earth.

The Bills fell to the San Francisco 49ers, who did not have Joe Montana but who did have an effective ground game. 
For all the weekend's sound and fury, only the New York <tag "530187">Giants</> assured themselves of a play-off berth and only the Washington Redskins were eliminated.

But this was late on, by which time the show had already gone up in smoke several times over. 
At the start, purple steam billowed round from behind what appeared to be a giant bathroom curtain.

800562
Although both General Motors and Ford would like to forge a liason with Jaguar, that interest does not translate automatically into a 28 per cent increase in the share price in a week. 
In some ways the share price performance has made a deal with one of the US car <tag "530183">giants</> less likely since the numbers have changed quite dramatically.

They could be excused for walking away as Robert Holmes a Court, whose presence has underpinned the price, appears to have done already.

I understand they informed the club on Saturday morning that they would not be available." 
Carlsberg League leaders, Kingston, and second-placed Manchester Giants, had a free weekend to concentrate on preparations for tonight's NatWest Trophy final at the Royal Albert Hall, where Kingston make their fifth appearance after winning four successive National Cup finals from 1985. 
<tag "530187">Giants</> are without their 6ft 8in forward, Martin Ford, who needs knee surgery, but Kingston's Joel Moore plays after resting the Achilles injury which cost him his England place in the European championship matches against Spain, Yugoslavia and West Germany last week.   

800567
Unlike most of the sights before, you are unlikely to be standing alone and I noticed that other visitors wandered round in disbelieving silence. 
Maybe they were looking for traces of cement which would give the game away, but the excellent visitors' centre explains that building materials such as cement were not available when the <tag "530189">giant</>, Finn McCool, built the causeway.   

800568
The abuse and vilification poured on him by the Salvadorean `oligarchy", the armed forces and supporters of the current government were an attempt to portray him as a gun-toting, bomb-throwing terrorist. 
A <tag "530184">giant</> hoarding placed at the main entrance to the University served to remind him and all visitors that UCA, and especially its Vice-Chancellor, was regarded by the government as little more than the intellectual base of the FMLN liberation movement.

The man with the missing piece of jigsaw had been as good as his word and her story was complete. 
And the crime writer had kindled fascinating speculation about Wilson and about Gower and about whether there was a link. 
Back at the office she found Rosie ministering to the <tag "530184">giant</> sweetheart plant on her desk, a `small appreciation" of a reader's gratitude that had grown into an enormous liability.   

800571
But at the same time, the aim is to pool research and development resources and so produce software which can run on computers from different manufacturers. 
The advantage, says Mr Imlay, of having a potential competitor as big as IBM, on the board is to give them easy access to the computer <tag "530183">giant</> and ensure that their software is fully compatible with IBM systems.

We shall hear more about this worldwide problem, despite attempts to suppress it. 
However, I plead guilty in one respect because when Japan's Shinjiro Kuwabra, manger of SC Properties asked me what I thought about Japan's <tag "530184">giant</> Cosmo World buying the four courses in the Pebble Beach area, I nearly forgot myself.

The Business Council on National Issues consists of the CEOs of 150 leading enterprises in the country, covering firms that employ a total of 1.5 million Canadians. 
In May 1989 BCNI set up a Task Force on the Environment and the Economy; it included such industry <tag "530183">giants</> as Canadian Pacific Forest Products, Consumers' Gas Company, Dofasco, Inco, ITT Canada, and Quaker Oats of Canada.   

800576
Frequently these are the same. 
The motor for this has been what might be called the entrepreneurial explosion over the last decade, which has sharpened the difference in rewards paid to owners as opposed to managers. 
People who own quite small businesses have become far better rewarded (when they sell them) than managers of <tag "530184">giant</> corporations.   

800577
The type of milk used and additives to the natural ingredients will all affect the finished cheese, as will the actual process of making the cheese. 
Factory-made cheeses are manufactured in huge quantities and each process is mechanised. 
The stirring is automatic, the cutting is done by machine and the milling is done by a machine working on the principle of a <tag "530184">giant</> food processor. 

800578
He has done just that and perhaps a little bit more. 
An unlikely lecturer at the Prince's school, for example, is John Taylor of Chapman Taylor Partners, the big commercial practice currently designing a <tag "530184">giant</> Post-Modern Classical shopping mall to replace the outmoded Bull Ring centre in Birmingham.

Predictably, it was the best half-year ever for the top three real estate companies in Japan's overheated property market.

Furuseth, runner-up in both the races which opened the 1990 season three months ago in Australia, leads the overall World Cup with 65 points from three races. 
Second-run casualties were the holder of the overall World Cup, Luxembourg's Marc Girardelli, who lost his edge in a turn and slid off the course, and Italy's Alberto Tomba, the 1988 Winter Olympic double gold medalist, who fell.

Onions are a very easy crop to grow, especially if you grow them from sets.

It is twice as abundant as lead or tin. 
Australia, South Africa, India and the US have vast deposits of zircon and zirconium oxide sands. 
More than 600,000 tons of the sand are mined each year to be used as heat-resistant linings for furnaces and <tag "530184">giant</> ladles for molten metal.

In a stream nearby, two stones from the cairn circles still stood upright. 
Over a hedge I could see a large stone sitting in the middle of the field, basking in the sun like a great toad. 
I took some photographs; then, tired and happy, lay on the mound and watched some large, white clouds with grey bellies drift like <tag "530184">giant</> manta rays through the swirling air.

But musically they scorch the ears with vocal presence: Anderson's exacting coloratura, under par but still good, Gedda's Helden-like projection, Ludwig's solid tonal strength. 
Jerry Hadley's Mozartian beauty in the title role, scarred by the `flu infection which half the cast seemed to be battling against, but charmingly wide-eyed and innocent, and the dark elegance of Kurt Ollman's Maximilian were no mean achievements either. 
As for Bernstein, conducting the LSO and Chorus, it was a model of the power of one <tag "530184">giant</> personality to galvanise his players and lift the performance off the scale of rational measurement.  

800587
Banks were nervous ahead of the interim reporting season. 
SQUABBLING over who has first rights to a press release may not appear the most seemly of pastimes for one of London's financial information giants. 
But Reuters is not an ordinary, everyday financial information <tag "530183">giant</>, and if trading punches with the Stock Exchange over a press release is what it takes to keep the wheels of a #3billion organisation rolling then no-one at 85 Fleet Street is going to worry unduly.

Whatever the religious, psychological, or sexual significance of the station, more powerful and directly ideological forces may be at work, using the station to convey a political message. 
At the very least, a station often mirrors the national ethos. 
One cannot but be struck by the Spanishness of Toledo Station or the Dutchness of Amsterdam or the clean, bold, heroic lines of Helsinki Central, with its guardian <tag "530189">giants</> so redolent of the spirit of Norse saga.

To buy RJR Nabisco, KKR raised $14 billion from banks, $6 billion from issuing high yield `junk" bonds and $5 billion from bridging finance and its own resources.

Faced with the task of stifling Alton Byrd, and trying to get Kingston's starting five into foul trouble, Manchester produced some stirring pressure defence, and only in the last four minutes could Kingston establish a flattering final margin. 
At half-time Kingston led 42-41, and they increased that to 69-62 with six and a half minutes left, only for the Giants to again pull back &dash. to 72-74 with three minutes, 43 seconds remaining. 
American Kris Kearney was the <tag "530187">Giants</> best player, taking nine second-half rebounds.

These accidents are mainly due to cuts caused by tins, children or pensioners falling over, accidental poisonings or burns and scalds from hot liquids, electrical appliances and chip pans. 
As a response to these accidents, Oxford City Council is staging a Kitchen Safety Week to highlight the dangers and to advise people to take precautions.

Lawyers for Paramount and disgruntled Time Inc shareholders yesterday argued that Time's own investment bankers considered Paramount's $200-a-share bid a fair one. 
Before the legal clash between the two media <tag "530183">giants</> in the Delaware Chancery Court, Paramount said it would pay Time shareholders 9 per cent interest on their tendered shares if its purchase of Time is delayed more than 60 days by federal, state and local regulators.

THE SALE of the A H Robins Company, creator of the defective Dalkon Shield contraceptive device, is to be completed by the end of the year following final legal clearance this week of a dollars 2.5bn ( #1.6bn) plan to compensate women injured by the device. 
American Home Products, the US consumer products and pharmaceuticals <tag "530183">giant</>, will acquire Robins for the equivalent of dollars 3.1bn, most of which will go directly to a trust established to settle claims by 200,000 victims of the Dalkon Shield, an intrauterine device removed from the market in the mid-1970s after widespread reports of injury.   

800598
What the scouting report did not say was that San Francisco's powerful batting line-up &dash. with the exception of Will Clark &dash. would be so comprehensively tamed. 
And neither did it suggest that the <tag "530187">Giants</> No. 1 starting pitcher, Scott Garrelts, would be driven from the game after only four innings having conceded five runs, two of them homers.   

800599
Even so, the work of those traditionalist architects who wanted to give a more truthful expression to the steel frame is possibly of more relevance today. 
There was the Beaux-Arts trained Glaswegian Sir John Burnet, who with Thomas Tait designed Adelaide House next to London Bridge with its crowning Egyptian cornice above a tight, vertical rhythm of stretched pilasters, never forgetting that a humane building needs interest at pedestrian level. 
This theme was developed by Leo Sylvester Sullivan in his subtly curved Lime Street facade, whose <tag "530184">giant</> pilasters unexpectedly dissolve into Grecian palmettes.   

800600
Soon it will also be the site of a #300m car factory. 
Under a <tag "530184">giant</> makeshift marquee, Tadashi Kume, the president of Honda, promised that the Japanese company would become a `good citizen of Europe" buying 80 per cent of components for its Swindon-built cars from European suppliers.   

800601
But when troops arrived on June 29 to move 400 inhabitants of Pakia, adjacent to the mine, to a `youth centre" some miles away, they discovered the villagers had fled. 
At the centre of the dispute is the embattled Bougainville Copper Ltd's mine, which is 19.1 per cent owned by the government and 53.6 per cent by British mining <tag "530183">giant</> Rio Tinto Zinc's Australian subsidiary, CRA.

In the meantime, they would take Mary off the computer for ever. 
But if they are so aghast at the idea of children receiving smokers' messages from then, perhaps they &dash. and the rest of the industry &dash. might also like to consider on March 14, this year's National No-Smoking Day, pledging to stop making newsagents' shops look like <tag "530184">giant</> cigarette packets, to stop sponsoring top sports on television and to stop paying leading sports personalities to advertise their wares.   

800606
Explain this in the light of the fact that adults treat each other with suspicion, contempt, servility, violence, vengefulness, etc. 
Knowing, as we do, how important it is to give young people a proper diet, why do British restaurants sport a separate `children's menu" which is limited entirely to fish fingers, burgers, <tag "530184">giant</> sausages and chips?   

800607
None the less, our descendants will surely blame us for the haphazard way in which river management often treats the remnants of our ancestors. 
I will not forget in a hurry the winter day in 1985 when I walked alongside a Shropshire river which had been dredged without proper thought for the environment, and downstream of which a very ancient canoe had previously been salvaged, rather by luck than by judgement. 
As we stumbled over a <tag "530184">giant</> log crumbling in the frost, the engineer made the immortal remark: `Not another bloody Iron Age boat!"

Sir Eric Ash was appointed Rector of Imperial in 1985, almost exactly 40 years after he first stepped through its doors as a 17-year-old undergraduate. 
He had been born and spent the first 10 years of his life in pre-war Germany where his father, a German-Jewish lawyer, was head of the legal department of electrical <tag "530183">giant</> AEG (now part of Telefunken).

All companies were dismissive of the value of using professional translation agencies and sought to be self-sufficient (either within own plant or through their international network). 
Ensuing discussion at the conference raised several key issues about the development and direction of the research project. 
Firstly, it was not entirely unexpected that <tag "530184">giant</> multinational German companies would be committed to providing a comprehensive language training service.

The draw for the first round proper of the world's most famous knock-out competition remains one of the game's annual delights. 
The `<tag "530280">giants</>" in tomorrow's fourth and final qualifying round are 16 GM Vauxhall Conference contenders, teams from whom this year's Suttons and Ketterings will come forward to embarrass their full-time brethren.

But again, we should beware of the assumption that the economic metropolis is necessarily the cultural metropolis. 
The most vigorous literary fiction over the last few decades has come to us from poverty-stricken Latin America, while Japan is no <tag "530280">giant</> of contemporary culture, and the little dragons of South-East Asia do not seem to be producing ideas or images on the same scale as their production of transistors and tankers.

Elsewhere, there was some normality. 
In a competitive match-up, the Eagles knocked the New York <tag "530187">Giants</> out of the unbeaten ranks, leaving the Los Angeles Rams, who had little trouble with the Atlanta Falcons, with the League's only perfect record.

Even more unusual, the claimants were equally matched. 
It was not a contest between a <tag "530300">giant</> and apparent pygmies, as it had been in 1918 with Lloyd George or was to be in 1945 with Churchill.

Armstrong, by nature taciturn, was the first man to set foot on the moon. 
He felt he ought to say something memorable, and meant to say, as his foot touched the dusty lunar soil `That's one small step for a man, one <tag "530184">giant</> leap for mankind," and was apparently surprised back on earth to find that he had left out the indefinite article.

It will be a very different Series now. 
Much will depend on which players have been affected more than others by the tragedy and which have been able to gear up for the restart at a time when players are usually relaxing with their families at the end of a long season.

Mr Craven argues that an active European mergers and acquisitions policy cannot be part of a company that is an active manager of industrial businesses, as Suez is.

Several Hill Samuel fund managers will be seconded to Tokyo. 
A relaxation in Japanese law allowing commercial banks to invest pension funds is expected soon and may lead to a boom in business for Dai-Ichi.

800632
Music is more complicated because electronic sound travels faster than natural sound, so people hear the `real" band a fraction of a second after they've heard its electronic reproduction. 
Music, therefore, should always come from a single source, not a single loudspeaker but a group of speakers close enough together for the natural sound to leave the platform at the same time as the electronic sound. 
Think of rock concerts where they have those banks of <tag "530184">giant</> speakers grouped together on the stage.

Does Birmingham want a centre where people live and work, or a shopping complex that draws in people who live and sleep at the end of the bus routes?

The leveraged buyout boom is one example. 
When profit was supreme and gearing meant something to bankers it would not have been possible.

BASEBALL, concerned lest it be seen to be ignoring the scale of the tragedy that has befallen hundreds of families in Northern California, has decided to postpone the resumption of the 1989 World Series by a week, with game three provisionally scheduled for Candlestick Park on Tuesday. 
Earlier, it had been suggested that all the remaining games would take place at the Oakland Coliseum, but after extensive structural analysis at Candlestick, Fay Vincent, the commissioner, announced that the <tag "530187">Giants</> would not have to forego home-field advantage for the next three games.

Two of the five vessels being built for Olsen are designed to comply with this legislation, and this, says Parker, will give it a proven ability to fit in with the new requirements.

The grim message was compounded by suggestions that De La Rue may have to return as much as #30m of the proceeds from the sale of its troubled Crosfield electronics subsidiary because of mounting losses at the company.

One of the pleasures of Barnes is that he is a surrealist who believes in research.

Walking slowly through autumn streets he had been wrestling with the ways in which it appeared to him that Coleridge had made use of a now little known book, Ridley's Tales of the Genii. 
Surely, he thought, the poet had digested passages of this work in his childhood?

Sunderland's American centre Scott Wilkie tied the scores on 105-105 with a three-point shot two seconds from full-time, and then a shot from his team-mate, Clyde Vaughan, tied them again at 109-109 at the end of the first extra five-minute period.

National trade unions, too, have long been aware of the frustrations of negotiations at `local" level when the real decisions are taken thousands of miles away.

Sunderland were without their England guard Stevenson for the third game since he damaged an ankle in training and, with fireman Colin Kirkham on duty on Wearside, their bench lacked depth. 
Sunderland's Clyde Vaughan was the first half's leading scorer with 16 points, but it took Saunders' first successful three-pointer out of five attempts to cut Giants' interval lead to 51-46.

This, coupled with its comparative rarity in the Western world, has lead some of the more cynical amongst physicians to doubt its very existence, and to suggest that it is really a collection of ulcerative genital conditions including herpes and trauma. 
The enormous variety in the clinical descriptions of the primary sores, from `dwarf" to `<tag "530184">giant</>", `transient" to `phagedenic" (destructive of tissue), and follicular" to `papular" might be taken as lending a little indirect support for this heresy.

Where these conditions are still absent, mergers have not taken place and large volumes of transactions have taken place through the market place. 
An obvious example is the lack of vertical integration in food manufacture and distribution, where the few <tag "530184">giant</> supermarket chains in Britain, and the USA, have not integrated backwards into manufacture, despite the huge volume of transactions each conducts with the suppliers.

This would threaten the development of up to 20 independent power station projects now under consideration, several of which are backed by area boards.
