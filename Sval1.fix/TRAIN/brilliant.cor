On the same morning there appeared obituary notices of two men widely different in the fields of activity to which they had devoted their lives, but with a similar singleness of purpose &dash. the one to academe, the other to the art and science of military endeavour. 
Both had connections with Oxford, the more lasting those of Dr Colin Roberts, recalled both as a Fellow of St John's College &dash. after a <tag "538323">brilliant</> career there as an undergraduate, he adorned its Senior Common Room for more than 40 years &dash. and as a Secretary to the Delegates of the Oxford University Press for half that time.

Close up she seemed quite ordinary, a perfectly normal teenager, no more attractive than most and not helped by the odd clothes that were at that moment the height of fashion among her peer group: a very ragged and faded pair of blue jeans, a man's suit jacket several sizes too large, gaudily coloured socks and clumpy black lace-up shoes. 
It was a <tag "538323-x">brilliant</> camouflage.   

800004
Also, as the war and my age advanced, by way of doing my bit to vary our diet I used to go crayfishing with friends in the stream that feeds the Blenheim Park Lane. 
In memory, at least, my childhood was idyllic &dash. the sun always shone, the meadows were rich with wild flowers, robins built their nests in discarded kettles and glow-worms, buried in grassy banks, shone at night. 
The recent weeks of blue skies and <tag "538379">brilliant</> sunshine brought these memories flooding back as I toiled to keep the crops happy and weeds down on my plot.   

800005
And his successor Mr Krenz, clearly feeling the rug being dragged from beneath him, protested: `I am not clinging to any personal power." 
Amidst the ferment in East Europe, only Romania resolutely displayed the boot face of socialism. 
The party congress hailed Nicolae Ceausescu as `the <tag "538322">brilliant</> genius of the nation" and a `genuine thesaurus of social and political thinking", and unsurprisingly re-elected him as leader.   

800006
In fact it is a good, lively and lucid summary of an on-going situation, preserved in the amber of ancient wrongs and new atrocities, and its concluding hope that the Good Haters will eventually disappear and the Decent Wee Men manage to sink their differences is still the best we can rise to. 
`Patin's <tag "538323">brilliant</> phrase, l'anti-Lucrece chez Lucrece, can be worked too hard": in the early pieces we see the philosopher-scholar showing off rather endearingly. 

800007
David Clelland (Lab, Tyne Bridge) asked: `Do you recall telling the nation on television only a week ago that you didn't know why the Chancellor had resigned? 
Can you explain how it is that someone you described as `brilliant &ellip. brilliant &ellip

She was the daughter of one of his colleagues, and she blundered upon him one end-of-term day while she was seeking her father. 
He had not heard the words of her apology, all he knew was that a young woman with the deepest blue eyes was standing in the doorway with <tag "538379">brilliant</> July sun filtering through her lint-fair hair .

Anyway he has the right approach and I'm sure something will result." 
Meintjies was equally impressed by John, writing in his diary that this `young ballet dancer and choreographer, who is undoubtedly <tag "538325">brilliant</>, dominated the guests &dash. although he is only seventeen."  

800013
What a stage production brings out is that the film we know is hardly Bernstein at all. 
Only three of his 17 numbers were used &dash. including the evergreen New York, New York &dash. and among the `missing" 14 numbers there are three or four hauntingly sentimental Bernstein tunes full of unexpected twists, including Gabe's Lucky To Be Me and the ensemble song, Some Other Time, ingenious in its contrapuntal entries, not to mention a show-stopping point number, one of Bernstein's boyhood pieces, I Can Cook Too. 
The Guildhall School's big advantage is to have an orchestra on hand from the music department that vies with any theatre band anywhere, and from the overture through to the playout music Chris Walker and his <tag "538325">brilliant</> and brassy young team were electrifying. 

800014
After Meyer finished reading out an essay on Kant, Berlin suggested they might find it more productive to discuss something else. 
Meyer was courting Barbadee and was immersed in romantic music: he suggested discussing Brahms, on which Berlin proved a <tag "538325">brilliant</> conversation partner.   

800015
These elements were inspired by his own experiences during the break-up with Sandra after she had suffered a bad LSD experience in her search for enlightenment. 
Fonda thought the play was <tag "538323">brilliant</>.   

800016
But what is the difference between orchestra and singers in Britain and the Continent? 
The sound is different. 
It's the sound of exceptionally <tag "538325">brilliant</> wind players that we have, not such good string players.   

800017
This was to celebrate the fiftieth birthday of the Marquess of Tavistock, who nearly two years ago was desperately ill, following a mammoth stroke. 
Thanks to a <tag "538325">brilliant</> surgeon, and good nursing; also untiring care and encouragement twenty-four hours a day from his devoted wife Henrietta, and their two elder sons Lord Howland and Lord Robin Russell, happily he has survived and made a miraculous recovery.   

800018
Keifrtz had seen that Hedda's father being stricken by a fashionable disease presented a clear opportunity and, working with Grogan's staff psychiatrists, conceived a plan to intercept Chay at the crossroads, as it were, by playing on Chay's innate male susceptibilities which Keifetz knew could divert him away from the young delicatessen heiress. 
He began with a congratulatory meeting which showered Chay with praise for the way he had handled the incidents within the Pacific Fleet and the treachery at Fort Gillem. 
`Your intuition concerning General Quest's sell-out to the Sandinistas was absolutely <tag "538323">brilliant</>, Chay," he told the young Marshal.   

800019
Clytemnestra does not forget these accusations which impute to her the psychology, not only of a child, but of a woman, given to irrational hopes and, where her emotions are involved, easily convinced. 
When, in two <tag "538323">brilliant</> speeches, her imagination has ranged over land and sea and over the scenes of siege and capture, `Here," she says, `you have my woman's words (348)."

Edward Johnston, the great Arts &and. Crafts calligrapher, designed the famous London Transport `bull's-eye" motif. 
Pick, and the <tag "538323 or 538325">brilliant</> palette of artists and illustrators he commissioned to design for the LPTB, played any number of games with this best known of all corporate logos.

I am determined to get rid of Ted. 
And I think that Margaret will be a great leader, and <tag "538325">brilliant</> at winning elections."   

800023
It was a hard act to follow. 
Mr Lawson was regarded by his fiercest critic (Margaret Thatcher) as `<tag "538322">brilliant</>" and `unassailable" before walking out of the set of `Neighbours".   

800024
Why should not a similar arrangement of music by Sullivan be equally popular, he wondered. 
He asked Peggy van Praagh to suggest a young choreographer to work with, and she told him that John was the most <tag "538322">brilliant</>.  

800025
A spokesman for the society said: `Directed research must not take all the money.

Our name came up, and we got a really big cheer. 
It was brilliant." 
`All we have to do now," smiles John, `is make an album <tag "538323">brilliant</> enough to follow it up."   

800027
Like most of Karajan's judgements, it is rational and soundly based, though it will always disappoint English music-lovers for whom the early 1950s Philharmonia was a high-water mark in the country's orchestral affairs, matched only by such other brief periods of glory as those enjoyed by Beecham's LPO and Boult's BBC SO in the 1930s and the LSO in the Monteux, Kerte&acute.sz, and early Previn years. 
Karajan's work with the Philharmonia was both <tag "538323">brilliant</> and painstaking.   

800028
But he knew he would be all right once he got into the van; the driving would sober him up. 
They packed in and Michael turned up the lights and set off on the homeward road, the cultivator bumping comfortably behind him, one soft rubber handle just touching his head. 
The road looked different at night, the grass verges a <tag "538324">brilliant</> green, the grey-golden walls of tall-windowed houses looming up quickly and vanishing, the trees bunched and mysterious above the range of the headlights. 

800029
Selling her books in print and television, she cultivated an image of spike-haired, spike-tongued aggression, encouraging the label of first punk feminist novelist. 
It was <tag "538323">brilliant</>.   

800030
The exact method of entrance to the colleges has varied over the years. 
When Lewis was sitting for the scholarship, there was a central pool from which the more <tag "538322">brilliant</> candidates could be drawn.   

800031
Jeannine Alton Tornrak Oxford sweltered under a heatwave and we needed to go, via the Apollo, to the Arctic. 
That we did is a great credit to Welsh National Opera's set designer, Bernard Culshaw and <tag "538323">brilliant</> lighting from Michael Whitfield.   

800032
It also accounted for Canizares, who had birdied the 1st and 3rd holes to make early inroads into McNulty's three-shot overnight lead. 
The 42-year-old Ryder Cup from Madrid is making a sterling effort to regain a place in the side, but those veteran Spanish eyes are now allergic to <tag "538379">brilliant</> sunlight.  

800033
I think John had given me up as hopeless. 
Then suddenly, when Hodson was reading one of his <tag "538323">brilliant</> essays, he quoted Bertrand Russell on a passage in Kant.   

800034
Not content merely to paraphrase bel canto, Bottesini wrote twelve operas himself, and Baron's detailed research would not have allowed him to pass over the composer's vocal output. 
Soprano Christine Barker's contribution, not always ideally firm but <tag "538395?">brilliant</> above the stave, showed that Bottesini's music for his heroine in the comic opera Ali Baba is terse and fairly dramatic. 

800035
It appeared that The Smiths thought they had given enough exposure to James and that Factory were now taking advantage of the situation. 
Rough Trade thought that recent press attention for James plus a <tag "538323">brilliant</> performance on Whistle Test was stealing a little too much away from the headline act.   

800036
Besides the principal village of Gaios there are two tiny fishing villages and several hamlets tucked in the shady olive groves. 
The east coast has more bays, coves, villages and anchorages to visit than there are days in your holiday, and the west coast has dramatic cliffs, sea caves and a spectacular rock arch to explore. 
An hour's sail to the south is Anti-Paxos, with <tag "538324">brilliant</> turquoise bays of fine white sand and two beach side tavernas. 

800037
`The coast is hell for most of the year," he says. 
We pass over red and green and black fields which together look like a vast Rastafarian draughtboard, then hundreds of working windmills, and eventually Palma Bay, which looks like a child's drawing of the seaside: <tag "538324">brilliant</> blue sea, custard coloured sand, white yachts and purple mountains in the background.   

800038
The sheer physicality of this piece may seem a long way from Moliere's text -Cre-Ange says that he hopes the latter is `still turning in his grave". 
Yet as a collaborator on various comedy ballets, Moliere knew about movement, and he would have prized the quality of this company's skills &dash. particularly the remarkable range of Weingand. 
A dancer who is also a <tag "538325">brilliant</> physical mimic, he can gear-change effortlessly from hilariously lank despair to brittle-boned temper to a fastidious dandified mince.

After the opening night of her London residency, only two categories need detain us here. 
She is Texan and she is <tag "538322">brilliant</>.

From that possibility, he goes on to blame bad potty-training for all her character defects. 
Which is a great pity, because if one cuts out all the Freudian claptrap, Abse has produced a <tag "538323">brilliant</> character analysis of the Prime Minister, and of the whole Thatcher phenomenon, which succeeded in scaring the wits out of me. 

800041
THE HIGHPOINT of the life of Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour came in 1968 when, against all odds, he saved the mutinous General Raoul Salan (head of the Organisation de L'Armee Secrete) from an expected death sentence for treason. 
With his deep voice, crumpled face, huge nose and ears and streak of cruelty, Maitre Tixier-Vignancour willingly symbolised all that was most demonic about France's extreme right. 
After a <tag "538323">brilliant</> student career at the Sorbonne he was called to the Paris Bar in 1926. 

800042
Yet belatedly, and briefly, the match erupted into something quite phosphorescent. 
When Kent entered the fourth of the last 20 overs on 76 for two the common assumption was that the game would run out of steam at 5.30. 
A <tag "538323">brilliant</> over by Allan Donald shifted the perspective but unfortunately for Warwickshire, who needed a win to retain top spot in the championship, it did not shift the game quite enough.   

800043
He mentions the lack of personalities like Wayne Sleep. 
I wonder that he has not seen the <tag "538325">brilliant</> young Tetsuya Kumakawa.

Angela Rumbold has been kicked downstairs. 
If she had a <tag "538323">brilliant</> political career she wouldn't have been given this job.

Coming from such a background, my father almost inevitably felt a call to the Methodist ministry. 
After achieving a <tag "538323">brilliant</> record at the Methodist College secondary school in St John's, he went to Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick, where he met my mother and where they both graduated in 1899, my father in Arts and Theology, my mother in Arts.

THE New York avant garde of the Forties, the Chicago avant garde of the Sixties, the British avant garde of the Eighties, and a local boy making good with a nod in most of these directions could be heard on one night in London last week. 
Red Rodney, Charlie Parker's most regular post-Gillespie trumpet partner and now a genial, stocky and energetic 62-year-old, was on display at Ronnie Scott's Club until Saturday and Chicago saxophonist and composer Henry Threadgill brought his band to the Bloomsbury Theatre on Tuesday, unveiling a collection of closely written, sometimes over-refined but immaculately played works by means of a curious band featuring bass and cello, two drummers and a trombone/trumpet/saxophones front line. 
A trio featuring the British musicians Simon Picard, Tony Marsh and Paul Rogers played the first half of the Bloomsbury concert, much of it a <tag "538323">brilliant</> exposition of coherent, intense and intelligent free jazz.   

800047
Here's Charlie now." 
They were all big men, topping six feet, but Charlie Hatton was a little fellow with a brown face and very <tag "538324">brilliant</> sharp eyes.

The Eagle levelled at 4-4 when Des Brackett beat Wells but in a tense last game the Eagle booked their place in the last eight when John McMahon beat Bowen. 
Six Bells, Kidlington proved too strong for hosts Plough Inn, The Bells cruising to a <tag "538323">brilliant</> 8-1 success.   

800049
It looked as if they had taken hostages. 
Thus began the stunning, <tag "538323">brilliant</>, inhuman revolutionary act that was to last for 444 days and, in the process, wreck innumerable lives, not least those of the hostages and their families.   

800050
The idea wouldn't have come as any news to Shakespeare. 
If his dark comedy Measure For Measure has emerged as one of the most popular Shakespeare plays of the last 15 years, it's because its exposure of the issues surrounding sex and politics is so staggeringly <tag "538323">brilliant</>, pungent and complete.  

800051
This said that the council's advisers `continue to be concerned about the company's artistic standards". 
This is a travesty of what happened at the panel's meeting on 29 November, when not only was there no agenda paper on Kent Opera but also it became clear to those present that the staff were very anxious to secure the acquiescence of the panel in a decision which had already been taken in principle by the council itself. 
I wonder how many members of that body had seen Kent Opera's <tag "538323">brilliant</> production of A Night at the Chinese Opera or their recent Burning Fiery Furnace.   

800052
By the end their positions have switched." 
For the cast of this mighty epic, Vidal draws on his <tag "538322">brilliant</> family and social connections, which included Mary Pickford, Marion Davies and throngs from the political world: his grandfather, Senator Thomas Gore puts in a fleeting appearance.

They thought it was a wayward fit of delinquency to test their vigilance. 
They watched him more closely after that but there were times when he slipped out to the fields in spite of their care and always in the same direction. past the old pear tree in <tag "538324">brilliant</> white blossom against the wall, last year's nettles withered and tangled in the abandoned mowing machine beneath the tree, the corrugated roof of the lean-to he had built as a workshop for wet days, and on to the meadow.

She knew, and by the strange osmosis that exists within small academic disciplines, everyone else began to know too, that she had found something radically exciting. 
Two years and two important papers later, she had produced her <tag "538323">brilliant</> reconstruction of a previously unknown, late Cretaceous carnivorous dinosaur, named after her father, but better known in the museum and in the literature as the `Dragon Type", which was generally agreed to prove the theory she had first suggested twelve years before.

And, though the exultant Glasweigan could now afford to give the rest of the indoor season a miss, he was still pondering a meeting with the two Africans at the Pearl Assurance national indoor championships. 
McKean was the only man to beat the <tag "538325">brilliant</> Ereng all last year &dash. and British promotions officer Andy Norman is sure to put his considerable weight behind persuading the Scot to take part in what could well be the highlight of the indoor season.

Steven Spielberg simply kept the same formula of Harrison Ford, thrilling stunts, horrible snakes, vicious Nazis and nail-biting chases.

Equally forceful in the formation of Lewis's future character were the darker sides of life.

Still visible from a year earlier was the faint outline in adhesive of one of the lengths of masking tape that we had Xed excitedly over the windowpanes before a hurricane that hadn't panned out; below it, a metal tube of antifungal ointment lay on the sill, its wrinkled tail spiralled back like a scorpion's, its Scotch-taped pharmaceutical torso of typed information so bathed in light now that I could make out only the normally pedestrian but now freshly exotic name of the prescribing pediatrician,`Dr. Momtaz".

There were no speeches, but just before Robin Tavistock cut his birthday cake, which had been moved to the middle of the gallery, the Hon. David Sieff asked us all to join in drinking Robin's health, to which Robin replied in two sentences welcoming everyone and saying he hoped we would all come to his 100th birthday party! 
I had the good fortune to sit between Ian Bedford, whom I have known since he was a teenager; and David Sieff, so I never had a dull moment!

We haven't got and English string style, whilst there is a specific German string style or a specific Belgian, a specific Russian, a specific French &dash. we haven't got that and we haven't got the richness and fullness of the string sound of the Continental orchestras on the whole.

Axelrod had already begun to think in ESS terms, but I felt that this tendency was so important that I wrote to him suggesting that he should get in touch with W. D. Hamilton, who was then, though Axelrod didn't know it, in a different department of the same university, the University of Michigan.

With Ben Elton's Stark in the field it would be damn close." 
At that moment all the lights went out &dash. there must be a chronic weakness in the circuit, I think &dash. and the effect of this was to put my brain into over-drive. 
After some minutes of concentrated thinking in the darkness, I came up with a <tag "538323">brilliant</> scheme.

There are upland dragonflies and  lowland dragonflies. 
The Norfolk Hawker (Aeshna isosceles) is confined to  the Norfolk Broads, while the <tag "999997">Brilliant</> Emerald (Somatochlora metallica) is a  speciality of Surrey, Sussex, and Hampshire.

But he did not need to. 
Five days of international diplomacy, taking him from the <tag "538379">brilliant</> sunshine of Rome and the Vatican to the fogs of Milan, and finally to the storms of Malta, have served a far greater purpose.   

800180
A display of basic pigments and minerals for paints and panel preparation highlight the complexity of processes. 
There is the expensive lapis lazuli (which would be ground down for the characteristic <tag "538324">brilliant</> blue), and even garlic cloves (the juice was used to stick gold leaf to the painted surface).  

800181
`Road Improvement" signs heralded scenes of devastation and banks of soft burning sand. 
The <tag "538324">brilliant</> orange blossom of Butea monosperma trees gave a splash of colour to the tinder-dry landscape. 

800182
He was also acutely aware of the vital role of the London Sinfonietta's education programme and those who have taken part in it know what a far-sighted and invigorating part of Vyner's vision it is and will continue to be. 
Players, composers and listeners have all lost a <tag "538325">brilliant</> organiser and administrator, a guide who maintained high standards, a person of great courage and an unparalleled flair for seeing his ideas through.

Sarah Webb lines up with the Walford Boys' Club team, which included stars from the EastEnders TV programme Top score: the County Dairies team, which lost the match but helped raise #1,000 for charity

Mac (then Miss Brown) lived in a caravan for two years and worked long hours -mucking out and grooming as well as riding &dash. while she was with this marvellously talented horsewoman who worked harder than anyone. 
`Caroline was <tag "538325">brilliant</> with young horses, it was wonderful to watch her," Mac says.   

800185
One of the most pronounced contrasts is the colour of the glass. 
Items produced in recent years are generally very clear and of a <tag "538324">brilliant</> colour &dash. by comparison Victorian glass is slightly darker in tone and less `sparkly".   

800186
But it lied. 
NIGEL LAWSON gave a <tag "538323">brilliant</> and devastating exposition of the Prime Minister's deficiencies in his speech to the House of Commons on Tuesday.   

800187
Argentina have only survived because of Maradona's enduring capacity to stand an apparently lost cause on its head. 
The goal he made for Caniggia that beat Brazil was a <tag "538323">brilliant</> piece of creative play but in a World Cup of collective effort and mass production was almost an idiosyncrasy. 

800188
He adopted the only profession open to him, as a mercenary soldier who fought for princes all over the known world, from the Netherlands to the Black Sea, and the only education open to him as a Latin poet. 
He married a <tag "538322">brilliant</> and beautiful Florentine called Alessandra Scala when he was about 40.

`Britain will never turn Fascist!" Maggie exclaimed. 
`Sir Oswald Mosley doesn't agree with you," Nevil countered. 
`Mosley is a <tag "538325">brilliant</> orator, but surely that's all?" Mrs Sanderson said.  

800190
Surely United couldn't do it, and in the eighty seventh minute, Paul Simpson ran clear and he shot home from close range. 
And then we saw that <tag "538323">brilliant</> save by Stowell and the crossbar denying United a famous victory.   

800191
`And Larry was a supreme comedian &ellip 
The delightful, self-regarding, almost feminine way he removed the little tricorn hat he wore as Mr Puff and stabbed it with a gigantic hat-pin was a highlight of <tag "538323">brilliant</> timing and mincing absurdity."   

800192
The Oath of the Horatii, centre-piece of the Louvre's `Jacques-Louis David", bore no more than a coincidental relationship to the French Revolution, which this show is meant to celebrate. 
David, brilliant propagandist as he was, would later claim a political significance for the painting, as a proto-Republican manifesto, that it never originally possessed. 
The Oath is, rather, a <tag "538323">brilliant</>, summary image of the Enlightenment, the product of a secular age virtually obsessed with the definition of secular virtue. 

800193
It was from among its supporters that most of the sponsorship money was found. 
The first Steiner school was founded in Stuttgart just after the First World War by the <tag "538322">brilliant</> Austrian Rudolf Steiner, who believed that schooling should engage pupils' entire personalities, including the spirit and the emotions.   

800194
`I am no one-season wonder, and I'll prove it," Tomba said. 
After yesterday's first run, he was a second ahead of Zurbriggen and then, in a <tag "538323">brilliant</> display of power skiing, Tomba not only kept the lead but stretched it in the second run.

Her mother was talking with an authority Jo had never heard before, her blue eyes reinforcing each point with a steady gaze. 
`I think you are quite marvellous on screen and I have no doubt you have a <tag "538323">brilliant</> career ahead of you."   

800196
For example, at Gastons, he had read through the Bacchae of Euripides in Greek and compared it with the poetic English rendering, which he much admired, of Gilbert Murray. 
At Oxford, he had the chance to attend lectures on the Bacchae by Murray himself &dash. the <tag "538322">brilliant</> young Australian who had become a Professor of Greek at Glasgow in his early twenties and had now returned to his old university to occupy the Regius Chair of Greek.  

800197
The world's timekeepers have decided to lengthen 1989 by a second, so you will hear seven `pips" instead of six. 
The reason for the `leap second" is that the earth's rotation is gradually slowing down, and we need an occasional adjustment to keep atomic clocks matched to the earth's rotation. 
Astronomers are expecting a rash of reports of the `star of Bethlehem" this Christmas, as the planet Venus is a <tag "538379">brilliant</> lantern in the south-western sky after sunset.   

800198
Aware that some of his audience were unappreciative, J. R. R. Tolkien mumbled and read badly. 
Christopher, who was about to show himself one of the most eloquent lecturers Oxford has ever known, was <tag "538325">brilliant</> at reading aloud, and took over the task.   

800200
and it took me a long time of, your know, hearing purists try to explain to me why {inaudible seconds=3} before I understood the distinction.

`What do you think of an old fellow like myself turning up to meet such a grand lassie?" Rose laughed and there was a general scramble to carry the baggage into the house. 
In the house Maggie unpacked the presents she brought: a <tag "538324">brilliant</> red woollen scarf for Rose, a brown V-necked pullover for Moran; Sheila and Mona were handed silken headscarves and Michael a saffron tie to go with his hair.   

800202
One of the few projects he set up from scratch, `Now" magazine, bit the dust with embarrassing rapidity. 
Sir James is a man with a <tag "538325-x">brilliant</> eye for a deal and his bid for BAT is the biggest example so far of the elevation of making money over making things.   

800203
His performances have been described as hard-pressed, but that is not accurate. 
Yes, Gardiner's tempi are relatively fast, but the EBS can easily cope with his virtuoso demands this places on them, and the attention to detail of phrasing and dynamics remains immaculate. 
Rather, the problem lies with the rigidity of his beat: it was this which, combined with an aggressiveness of attack, made the fast movements here so emphatic, <tag "538323">brilliant</> but brittle.   

800204
Or take Ferranti's decision to buy ISC. 
The chap now being sued by Ferranti was seen as one of the most <tag "538325">brilliant</> defence equipment salesmen in the world.   

800205
Many of the books, perhaps most of them, that he was studying for Mods were already familiar to him. 
Being a naturally fluent reader with a <tag "538325">brilliant</> teacher in W. T. Kirkpatrick, he would probably have been equipped to get a good mark in Mods in his last month at Great Bookham. 

800206
Unfortunately the central theme got overlaid by the incidentals. 
There was a subplot involving a society hostess, Signora Scintillarda, her two lovers and their wives: not very interesting in itself, and distracting, especially as the two lovers were given showily <tag "538323">brilliant</> solos, so that they overshadowed the dramatic impact of La Capricciosa's admirers, who had only acting and partnering roles. 

800207
Cecil Gee, the UK menswear chain owned by Moss Bros, is the largest British stockist of Hugo Boss. 
Roland Gee, managing director of Moss Bros, and an unabashed admirer of the German company's marketing strategy, said: `They are simply <tag "538325">brilliant</>, building up an upmarket power dressing image through brilliant design and marketing, and through sponsoring sports like motor racing."

He and Evgenia decided to move from the Lakes to Suffolk, where the East Coast rivers offered a paradise of variety for a coasting sailor and Ransome found that `there were always web-footed children to help with the rigging, or to drink ginger pop". 
In We Didn't Mean to Go To Sea, the Swallows return to the centre of the stage. 
The story, the most technically <tag "538323">brilliant</> of all the Ransome books, is a tribute to Ransome's best-loved boat, a thirty-foot-long, seven-ton cutter built by Hillyards of Littlehampton in 1931.

And it is to be hoped he has pointed out to his staff that it should not take four approaches before something like this is put right. 
Topical ON Friday, gardeners were gardening in short sleeves and marvelling at how far forward everything is. 
The temperature was soaring to near-record February heights and all confined to buildings were casting longing looks at the <tag "538379">brilliant</> sunshine scene outside.

They are in hospital at Swindon with a third stable lad. 
CHARLTON striker Paul Mortimer insists his side are not dead and buried in the battle for First Division survival. 
Mortimer scored a <tag "538323">brilliant</> goal as Lennie Lawrence's perennial escape merchants recorded their second win in a week, 2-1 at fellow strugglers Manchester City on Saturday.   

800212
At home, at least, he is recognised as The Master. 
Dave Stringer's description, `Absolutely <tag "538322">brilliant</> &ellip. the best in the League", is fairly typical. 

800213
These figures define class distinctions which endured through life. 
Yet, by a <tag "538323">brilliant</> twist, the universities which catered predominantly for a narrow privileged class were presented as national institutions and received slightly more than half their income from public funds.   

800214
In the Jack Sadler Cup quarter-finals Leyward Athletic gave another superb display to dispose of Oxford United SC 5-1. 
A <tag "538323">brilliant</> solo effort from Julian Price set Leyward on the way, and a Simon Dickens double, plus a goal from Graham Turner, put them in the driving seat at half-time.   

800215
Jennifer Capriati has been told cautionary tales about Austin and Jaeger so often that she could be forgiven for thinking they are her half-sisters. 
The <tag "538325">brilliant</> 13-year-old American, who defeated Lake in three sets in an Under-21 event at Eastbourne in June and whipped Clare Wood, the new national champion, 6-0, 6-0, in the Wightman Cup in September, is due to join Seles on the tour in March.   

800216
The touch-judges thought otherwise. 
The Blues responded with another Oliver penalty and a try by flanker Phil Suddell to trail only 10-18 after halftime. 
The students then closed the gap still further with a <tag "538323">brilliant</> individual try by right wing Richard Sennitt, who jinked his way over from 4O metres.   

800217
Some would call this unnecessarily interventionist, particularly when the process does not involve donors but a loving married couple whose egg and sperm simply can't get it together without assistance. 
But Walby maintains: `If you're intervening actively in a process to `give" a couple a child those involved in that process have a different set of responsibilities that go beyond deciding how many to implant and whether to consider the remaining ones potential life or `laboratory material"." 
Take Doron &dash. the highly publicised wonder-child born from the Nobel sperm bank in California to a <tag "538322">brilliant</> and ambitious mother determined to produce a prodigy by immacullate conception.

Schedules are available from the show secretary, David Seymour, at 48 Papist Way, Cholsey. 
AFTER a <tag "538323">brilliant</> start to the season, General Elliott A tasted defeat for the first time when they went down to their first defeat, 5-1 against Section 2 rivals Cricketers Arms A. Bob Campbell, Woodward and Moss gave Cricketers a 3-0 lead and although Elliott pulled one back when John Spencer beat Woodward, back came Cricketers as Andy Smith and Bennett sealed victory.   

800219
Although the British flame was doused in the Turf and the Mile, in which Most Welcome's fighting third place was the only glimmer of salvation, even the most partisan visitors were mesmerised by the explosive finale of the Classic. 
It created a spine-tingling atmosphere which could never be reproduced in the spineless climate of non-competitiveness than pertains in British racing. 
That criticism is not directed specifically at the Arabs, for while it is true that the Maktoums' two <tag "538380">brilliant</> colts, Nashwan and Old Vic, never got round to meeting in what could have been a thrilling race, the policy of ensuring champions avoid each other has long been with us.   

800220
I have two selections this month: The Pet Shop and The Black Cat by Allan Ahlberg, with illustrations by Andre&acute. Amstutz (Heinemann, #5.95 each). 
One of the finest books I ever had to review was Janet and Allan Ahlbergs Funnybones, a <tag "538323">brilliant</> tale of what a skeleton family gets up to at night when everyone else is in bed.   

800221
At McGill, as at Ottawa Collegiate, I was blessed with exceptional teachers. 
Stephen Leacock, head of the department of Economics and Political Science, was one of the most <tag "538322">brilliant</> men I have ever known.   

800222
While this was presumably added to salute the Christmas season, the performance was not very festive. 
Mr Maksymiuk is a great one for rousing tempi, but in the last item &dash. sometimes called the `Dance of the Tumblers" &dash. his tempo was just half a metronome mark too fast and the stamping, virile heart went out of this <tag "538323">brilliant</> gopak.

`I want to play on the US Tour eventually, too, and the Americans don't care how much money you have won. 
But they would be impressed by you winning the order of merit &dash. especially in Ryder Cup year." 
STEVEN SMITH'S perseverance with the <tag "538323">brilliant</> but wayward Brook Street Picnic paid off last night at the Horse of the Year Show, when he won the #4,000 first prize for the Leading Show Jumper of the Year title.   

800224
He was happy and cheerful. 
The mood was <tag "538325-x">brilliant</> and not entirely because of his new acclaim, which undoubtedly settled his future; that of actor first and director occasionally.   

800225
He knew, it was clear, very much about trees. 
For many years this passion for the land was nurtured on the family estate, Treago near Hereford, where Roger, his <tag "538322">brilliant</> twin brother Humphrey (who died earlier this year), and their wives lived a simple and regular life in a house wonderfully combining grandeur with intimacy. 

800226
For Phoebe it may have felt like a defeat, but to Maggie and Rachel it was a moment of delight, a moment of victory. 
And amazingly, it worked. 
For the next ten years Rachel lived with a glowing certainty that it had been a <tag "538323">brilliant</> idea, the second best idea of her life.   

800227
`He had signed for Warrington at one minute past 12 on his birthday, and I think he wanted to recreate that excitement for Shaun." 
Jackie Edwards is remembered for five <tag "538323">brilliant</> seasons as a half-back with Warrington in the Fifties.   

800228
By the end of the tour kids were throwing themselves at the stage like little `kamikazis". 
Sure it started out lukewarm, but once people saw him they went crazy, and by the end of the given tour, he had a totally devoted following because he's a <tag "538325">brilliant</> performer.   

800229
Probably Moxie brought them. 
By contrast Jack and Alison were <tag "538322">brilliant</> figures, taller than the others, and upright, whereas the other four crouched a little and bent their heads.   

800230
But this is a far more coherent assault. 
Still, for all its high points (and <tag "538323">brilliant</> sleeve), `Do Your Own Thing" remains an enjoyable but unsurprising album.

French-Canadian nationalism can help to beget English-Canadian nationalism." 
This tripe is part of what the prominent MLA described as `the most <tag "538323">brilliant</> succinct analysis of the crisis in Canadian Confederation."  

800232
The evening concert in St Paul's Hall by Music Projects London under Richard Bernas gave almost unmitigated pleasure. 
Murail's Memoire / Erosion reproduces elements of tape-delay on conventional instruments, holding together diverse patterns by means of echo and distortion. 
Still more exciting was the hectic vision of Harvey's Valley of Aosta, in which <tag "538323">brilliant</> and incisive instrumental playing overwhelmed attractive but lifeless electronics. 

800233
There is also the view that Honeyghan's hands, a source of constant trouble, are not in good enough condition for him to slog away for 12 rounds. 
Breland is the favourite, but Honeyghan overcame greater odds when he beat the <tag "538325">brilliant</> Don Curry to become undisputed champion in September 1986.   

800234
For a while he appeared to be correct. 
She made a <tag "538323">brilliant</> debut in This Girl's Army and followed up with two light romances; the publicity department declared that she was grown up when she charmed Alfred Hitchcock and won an Oscar nomination for Reasonable Doubt, a sophisticated courtroom melodrama.  

800235
This, unfortunately, has been the fate of 14 gold panners in the town of Puerto Maldonado, deep in the Peruvian jungle. 
The vampiros, which have wingspans of more than three feet, swoop into their thatch huts late at night and attach themselves to the sleeping miners' heads, necks and feet. 
One Peruvian veteran recalled that the worst thing about the vampiros is that, because they are such <tag "538325">brilliant</> surgeons, they can make their incisions without even waking the victim.   

800236
The jewel in the crown, of course, is the Ciga Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, which has attracted 163 entries, 59 of them trained in England. 
Nashwan (English Derby and 2,000 Guineas) and Old Vic (French and Irish Derbys) are our main three-year-old colts, while Michael Stoute's <tag "538380">brilliant</> Oaks winner, Aliysa, is our leading lady.

It was between Brian and Christy and the boss at the end. 
And it was down to two <tag "538323">brilliant</> second shots by the boss, with a bit of confirmation on the clubs from me, where the 1965 British Open title was going.  

800238
Islamey was followed by a rather quirky performance of Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto, in which the soloist was the 22-year-old Olli Mustonen, a compatriot of the conductor. 
Comparisons are sometimes drawn between this work and Mozart's great K491 Concerto in the same key, which Beethoven is known to have played and admired. 
The similarities, however, are mostly in matters of device (the piano arpeggios in the first movement Coda, for example, and the six-eight ending of the Rondo, tragic in Mozart, <tag "538323">brilliant</> in Beethoven).  

800239
His charity-begins-at-home appeal will hopefully have its effect in practical cash terms. 
But the truth of the matter is that <tag "538325">brilliant</> surgeons such as the JR can boast should not have to be in the business of going round suggesting where the begging bowl should be held out next. 

800240
The Shadow Chancellor insisted Labour would join at an `effective rate", and providing there were `adequate swap arrangements between central banks" and well-organised regional policies. 
Mr Smith recalled the superlatives that the Prime Minister had used to describe Mr Lawson, as he cautioned the new Chancellor: `If she calls you <tag "538322">brilliant</>, you should be wary.

Moss Finn, who but for injury could have been facing the All Blacks again today, took up the story. 
`It was a day when you had Tony (Ward) playing at his <tag "538323">brilliant</> best.

The irony of their relationship was that Richard worshipped his tutor. 
`He is a <tag "538322">brilliant</> man, brilliant," Richard informed Victoria with solemnity.  

800245
The two rowdy West Indians obviously thought of themselves as wits of the first order and they were able to make the fat lady respond to their nonsenses with weird bursts of laughter. 
A sound more like a furry animal in pain than a big white woman enjoying herself. 
One of the brown immigrants deliberately poured some of his coffee over the pale slab of sugar crusted fruit pie he was eating, and this was thought to be a <tag "538323">brilliant</> piece of improvised humour.   

800246
Chris Lysons, Great Harwood's goalkeeper, will remember her first National League game for different reasons. 
Against Slough, she saved a penalty stroke from Karen Brown but was beaten six times &dash. twice by Brown and twice by another GB striker, Kate Parker, the Slough captain, with further goals coming from Lesley Hobley and Sue Chandler, Slough's latest recruit. 
Ealing were quickly into action in their game against Orpington, with Jane Jagger opening the scoring in the second minute following a <tag "538323">brilliant</> move involving Joan Lewis and Mandy Langridge.   

800247
`He was outstanding and moved me to tears." 
`It was a <tag "538323">brilliant</> academic study, and we all felt very touched and moved."

He almost fell out of the tree. 
But then the hard wood pressed notches into his back, and his whirling, emptying head steadied, filled, and put God back into the world, holiness back into the Forest. 
A <tag "538324">brilliant</> bird alighted on the opposite branch, cocked its head to show the jewels set within it, settled, and then realized that the boy was there, a mere span away. 

800249
In the memoirs, for instance, Beauvoir's parents became symbols of the bourgeois mentality from which she sought to free herself. 
Here, her mother in particular emerges as rather touching in her attempts to understand and keep up with her <tag "538322">brilliant</> daughter, attempts viewed by the younger Beauvoir as prying.   

800251
Every morning for the past 13 years, the first thing Dr Nicholls has done in her room on the top floor of the Clarendon Building is go through the obituaries in The Times. 
Then she files away the names of the good, bad, great and <tag "538322-n">brilliant</> on cards in shoe boxes.   

800252
Lucy is a niece, I think, still at school, and shares Alison's low opinion of my work. 
The other day, Michael O'Mara, the <tag "538322">brilliant</> young American publisher (and an exception to the general rule in that his opinions on everything &dash. except, paradoxically, American football, in whose mysteries I'm trying to educate him &dash. are of the greatest interest) rang up to do a deal.  

800253
That 48 1/2 inch long weapon, described by some as a monstrosity and others as an affront to decency and the Royal and Ancient game, has, according to Sam, done no less than salvage his entire career. 
However, other factors also played major roles in the revival of a <tag "538323">brilliant</> career often blighted by putting lapses and finally threatened by the universally feared yips.  

800254
Drivers who used to speed down narrow Howard Street in East Oxford now have to negotiate a series of chicanes and large flower tubs, designed to slow vehicles or persuade motorists to take a different route. 
Work on the #99,000 six-month city council experiment, which includes nearby Magdalen Road, started this week, sparking reactions from `<tag "538443">brilliant</>" to `a waste of money".   

800255
The inclusion of music from Haydn's Esterhazy period, for instance, seems something of a red herring under the circumstances, as do two performances of Berlioz's The Damnation of Faust. 
As appetisers, Kodaly's Dances from Marosszek and Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra serve their purpose well enough nevertheless, and if the incessant repetitions of Liszt's First Piano Concerto left us wishing for the more powerfully cogent Second, there was still the controlled wildness and fantasy of the <tag "538325">brilliant</> young pianist, Zoltan Kocsis, to admire.   

800256
Most matches have been pretty close, but Cheetahs romped to the half century in this and the match at Swindon on Saturday. 
Hans Nielsen underlined what a loss he would have been to Oxford had the two parties not come to their senses in the recent overplayed dispute on terms by scoring a <tag "538323">brilliant</> 15 point maximum. 

800257
`What did you think of that then?" Nevil demanded as they left the meeting `It was all right" `Only all right." he exclaimed, scandalized. 
`It was utterly <tag "538323">brilliant</>."   

800258
Before the match began, Yusupov was quoted as a 5-1 outsider. 
But Karpov's play has been far below his best and Yusupov's <tag "538323">brilliant</> equalising victory has generated a murmur of a possible upset. 

800259
Many scholars have been of this opinion. 
But in his <tag "538323">brilliant</> introduction to the play D. L. Page has argued that Agamemnon has no choice.   

800261
Factory bonuses have been replaced by compulsory pay deductions to buy government bonds, and many enterprises say they cannot buy the bonds because they no longer have any cash. 
It is a nightmare that would test the most <tag "538325">brilliant</> economist.   

800262
Afterwards consumer education officer Mrs Sarah Carter said she was delighted with the youngsters knowledge. 
`I think they were absolutely <tag "538325">brilliant</> and I was really impressed with Blessed George Napier School who really did a lot to get through to the final," she said.

RIGHT NOW, though, the king of trash is in command a the record player. 
``Slade Alive", what a <tag "538323">brilliant</> album!" gleams Gordon as he digs in early-'70s' vinyl from behind a mound of Elvis ashtrays.

In trying to improve a poor scheme, the pupil makes a greater effort than he would if you gave him from the beginning the right solution. 
The pupils working together and not obliged to keep to their preliminary sketches, arrive after a time all to have the same scheme, which is either that of the most <tag "538322">brilliant</> pupil among them, or the one that the Instructor has pointed out as the best solution.

Even at her wedding, his daughter is upstaged by a display of cranky, high-tech hardware. 
It is the play's domestic strand that engages the powerful dramatist in Poliakoff and he is aided by <tag "538323">brilliant</> performances from Lesley Sharp as the daughter, Roxie, and Simon Russell Beale as Danny, the son.  

800268
According to some surveys among clients, UK investors are heavily overweighted in the market.

If you have just been stuffed by a team that is not <tag "538325">brilliant</> but is a darned sight better than your team, and you do not want to slag off your own lads, then that is the sort of back-handed compliment you chuck out.

George, Jack, Peter, Michael and Nico were all to be known throughout their lives as the boys who inspired Peter Pan. 
Nonetheless, Barrie always claimed that the character was an amalgam of all five of them and that  Peter Pan was produced: `by rubbing the five of you violently together as savages with two sticks produce a flame."

In the last few weeks of his life the problem was at last officially acknowledged at the executive committee of the UNHCR and by Echosoc, the inter-agency governing committee of the UN.

Myfanwy Piper, remarking that its ` freedom and absurd gaiety &ellip. startled many ballet enthusiasts", commented also that it was `the beginning of what has become to be Cranko's ideal: variations; formal, abstract, <tag "538323">brilliant</>, but linked by story of human interest."

The genesis of the poster of 1891 lay in Lautrec's earlier renderings of the same theme, and their origins in popular imagery. 
All the basic elements, in fact, had already appeared in Au Moulin Rouge, la danse, his masterpiece of 1890: the background frieze of top-hatted bystanders, the female dancer &dash. now transformed into La Goulue &dash. doing her insolent high kick, the wavy silhouette of Valentin le De&acute.sosse&acute. with his hat tipped rakishly forward, the receding orthogonals of the floorboards, the spatial organization in three parallel planes, the <tag "538324">brilliant</> yellow lights encircling the background columns. 

800288
He stood, poised on the brink, looking down. 
The centre of the lake was glittering, colourlessly <tag "538379">brilliant</>, but along the edge the green banks could be seen reflected and the blue sky, the colours clear yet strangely altered into the colours of a dimmer and more obscure world: the charm of swimming in still waters, that sense of passing through the looking-glass, of disturbing and yet entering that other scene that grows out of the roots of this one.

The brothers entered the pub, Freddie in front now by several yards. 
Harry's unrehearsed reaction to what he saw and heard and just about as powerfully smelt was to look for the nearest means of escape, but of course Freddie was striding eagerly forward into the land of the bacon butty in butter and with fried tomatoes on the side, where nobody he knew ever came.

But as in past seasons the opening fixtures will be very much a mixture of challenge matches and cup fixtures as the team hope to settle down before the big challenge on the league front. 
Cheetahs travel to Belle Vue and Wolverhampton for their opening challenge matches on March 16 and 19, before bringing up the curtain at Sandy Lane on March 23 with the return challenge against Wolves. 
Then, on the weekend of March 30 and 31, Cheetahs take on the old enemy Cradley Heath in the two legged Premiership final where Cradley will look a strange sight without the <tag "538325">brilliant</> Erik Gundersen who was forced to retire following his horrific crash at Bradford last year.

When Belaye is picked up and moved aside by his angry crew, for instance, it exactly parallels the way he has earlier removed the importunate woman from his own path; repetition and contrast underlie many of the visual jokes.

Of this last film the Argentinian fabulist Jorge Luis Borges laconically wrote: `The vigorous message of Now, Voyager is: When Bette Davis is disfigured, she is less beautiful." 
In the late Forties, just as her career was sinking to its lowest ebb, and an English critic commented of her notorious egomania that `only bad films are good enough for her", she returned in triumph with one of her most <tag "538323">brilliant</> performances, as the ageing but feisty actress Margo Channing who, to her emotional and professional cost, learns All About Eve (directed by Joseph L.

The `kit of parts" includes devices to link, credit and preview programmes in a way that preserves local identity while branding them as belonging to the ITV network.

THE North-west's first mass summons for non-payment of poll tax disintegrated into legalistic chaos yesterday afternoon when Warrington magistrates agreed to adjourn the cases of anyone who wanted them adjourned.

Nor his brass neck in expecting the police in foreign cities to sort out his problems for him. 
For one thing, the English fans (those with and without malice) will be literally on a hiding to nothing, for the foreign gangs await them with relish now, because the disease the English exported in the first place has now broken out in an irretrievable rash all across the great cities of the Continent witness the four deaths and appallingly ugly racist street violence in West Germany on Sunday night.

My idea is to get the whole ballet worked out as a mere skeleton, and then embroider it when the cast know it." 
That is the only mention of a `co-producer" and Lionel Luyt suggests that John was probably using Patricia Murphy to work out steps and phrases on her. 
One of the leading dancers with the Ballet Club, she is described by Luyt as having a <tag "538323">brilliant</> technique, and he says she `was compact and a dream to do double-work with, and was fearless in trying out death-defying lifts".

There was an outstanding Kecal in Stafford Dean, majestic in his double dealing, and a most affecting Marenka from Christine Bunning, her voice edgily Slavonic and capable of a range of emotion. 
David Owen offset the comic stuttering of Vasek with his charming quality of voice in a performance of considerable technical accomplishment, and Ryland Davies, if a little vulnerable at the top, made a fine Jenik. 
Finally, there was the most colourful of circus troupes led by Brenda Larenty's <tag "538380">brilliant</> Tightrope dancer.

Passengers play spontaneously, usually after a pint or two, and the singing is so loud it must warm the cockles of the few remaining bushmen outside. 
I retired a little before midnight to a luxurious cabin (the Ghan cabins were all built very recently for two passengers each) and woke early to catch the most inspiring experience of the whole 70-hour journey. 
As one not born in the bush, I thrilled at the sight of the desert dawn breaking in its leisurely, powerful manner and slowly covering the dark-red soil with its <tag "538324">brilliant</> light, competing with the morning star for a long while before overwhelming us.

Demonstrations took place from Rostock in the north to Cottbus in the south, but the toughest test for Mr Gysi comes today in Leipzig. 
Sebastian Pflugbeil, a leading member of the New Forum opposition group, said the Leipzig demonstration could go further along the road of demands for German reunification, and raised the fear that right-wing groups would organise to exploit the power vacuum. 
A gruelling 17-hour weekend congress elected Mr Gysi, 41, a <tag "538325">brilliant</> lawyer, to lead it through what members hoped would be a transformation into a modern, democratic socialist party.

Shortly after my own appointment to the Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital, I joined him as fellow consultant in his weekly out-patient clinics and began a friendship which lasted until his death last week. 
His reluctance to commit patients' details to paper (he used a personal system of hieroglyphics) and an eagerness to suggest new, original and occasionally unrealistic ideas for developing our speciality were the hallmarks of a kindly, <tag "538322-x">brilliant</> mind.

His motives were exactly the same; his method a good deal more subtle. 
He himself had a large measure of insecurity, for Patrick's mother had committed the social misdemeanour of divorcing his father without securing adequate wealth to maintain her status; instead of marrying again, she had devoted herself to her <tag "538322">brilliant</> son, whose ambition was now to regain the position of which they had both been cheated.

You're the darling of the royalists, my unprofound fellow, and you'd force the average citizen to live in a nation where privacy is obsolete, free thought suspended by censorship, the rich get richer, and for the poorest among us the beginnings of potential life itself may well have to be abandoned in order to survive.

When we turn back from Surprised by Joy to the Lewis family papers we find not that C. S. Lewis has exactly speaking lied about his father but that he has left so much out of the picture and painted it from a position of such uncontrollable prejudice that it is something of a shock to encounter Albert Lewis on his own terms and read his speeches, poems, letters and notebooks. 
A clever, highly imaginative boy, Albert had been educated at Lurgan College, County Armagh, where his headmaster, a <tag "538325">brilliant</> young logician called W. T. Kirkpatrick, formed and retained throughout life a high view of his capabilities.

In the Fifth Form (Grade 13), which I did in one year instead of the customary two, I narrowly missed the General Proficiency Medal, which was won by a <tag "538322">brilliant</> girl in her second year in the Form.

Cooke beat the 17-year-old Maksim Shmyrev in straight games and clinched the winning 4-1 lead with a 21-18, 21-14 victory over Andrei Mazunov. 
But it was Carl Prean's opening victory of the night against Dimitri Mazunov, the younger and the more unpredictably <tag "538325">brilliant</> of the two brothers, that was the best contested.

He had opposed it along with the rest of the General Advisory Committee but it was no clear-cut moral stand: `I never urged anyone not to work on the hydrogen bomb project," he told the inquiry. 
Nevertheless a <tag "538325">brilliant</> scientist was being fired from government service and his reputation as a patriot clouded (although he was affirmed a `loyal citizen") &dash. because of what?   

800364
Goldcrest trusted producer Irwin Winkler to keep the production under control, but he had not been the stronger member of the Chartoff &dash. Winkler team responsible for the Rocky films. 
His solo productions, such as New York, New York (1977) and The Right Stuff (1983), were rambling, if sometimes <tag "538323">brilliant</>, works.   

800365
`It was a time of freshness and discovery of what acting was all about," he said. 
`It was about meeting new people and being inspired by other people's work, or watching an actor or actress who could hardly talk come into a class and then six months later suddenly do a <tag "538323">brilliant</> scene.

He was so pleased to have her, so delighted with her, with himself, with the dig, he overflowed with joy and it lightened them all. 
Rachel perceived quickly that he did not have a <tag "538322-x">brilliant</> mind, but instead a brilliant personality.

It marks a <tag "538323">brilliant</> debut by Ian Hawkes as the young boy.

Then there was the day of the fair. 
Wilfred and Harold had been persuaded to go, by their mother, rather against their will &dash. for it had been organized in aid of some religious charity and promised to be more decorous than a fair should be. 
They set off, however, cheered by the pleasant jingle of small change in their pockets, and followed the more raucous music of the fairground to a green Border valley ablaze with coloured awnings and flags, paintwork and brasswork <tag "538324">brilliant</> under the August sun.   

800369
After his father's death in 1930, he went to work for the book and magazine publisher Rizzoli in Milan. 
It was while working as a magazine editor at Rizzoli in 1934 that he wrote his first screenplay &dash. for the <tag "538323">brilliant</> satirical comedy I'll Give a Million, filmed by Mario Camerini in 1936 with De Sica, then a popular romantic actor, as its star.

Jodie Foster, fresh from her triumphs in The Accused (released on video last month), is the only reason to bother, as with Five Corners (15 Pathe 13 Oct), where she is almost raped again and is carted about, unconscious, by a psychopath. 
Punchline (PG RCA/Col 20 Oct) fails to convince that either Tom Hanks or Sally Field, who idolises but won't love him, are natural stand-up comedians, and the general standard of jokes is pretty thin all round. 
However, Hanks's `Singin' In The Rain" routine is <tag "538323">brilliant</>.

He came from a Protestant family, was brought up in a comfortable home, the younger of two brothers, went to Portora Royal High School in Ulster, which Oscar Wilde, another Irish Protestant, had also attended, and then Trinity College in Dublin.

Indeed, Australia's three new caps, the prop, Crowley, the centre, McGuire, and the full-back, Martin, played prominent parts in the fluent instinctive rugby that swept aside the Lions. 
It was fitting that Martin completed a fine all-round display with a try at the posts after a <tag "538323">brilliant</> scissors move involving Farr-Jones in the closing stages.

East London during and just after the war is lovingly portrayed, with an eye and ear for detail which strike a nostalgic chord. 
The milk bottle on the kitchen table, the women knitting and despising their menfolk with <tag "538323">brilliant</> bitter humour, the crowded nights in the Underground station, all capture that incomparable spirit of the Londoner, and one of glorious Londoner in particular &dash. Vi, the courageous mother of the Kray twins.   

800374
If anyone was to blame, it was the anti-drugs policy of successive governments, and especially president Richard Nixon's, but that's another talking point on which he would hold forth at the drop of a hat. 
What Easy Rider and Nicholson did capture was the mood in America and elsewhere at that time. 
It was not a `<tag "538323">brilliant</>" movie; the script was flawed and the premise was suspect, but the underlying presence that Fonda, Hopper and Nicholson caught, perhaps without even realizing it, was an air of tension that prevailed among youth right across the world in 1969.   

800375
It was, in these years, a good place in which to work. 
I had the good fortune to work with a <tag "538325">brilliant</> head of department, and paid #10 for a 1927 Austin 7 in which I drove uncertainly every day from Wimbledon.

Mother almost never wears any of them, although she likes this because it's quite small." 
Martha laughed, because the central diamond was bigger than her thumbnail and so <tag "538324">brilliant</> that it had reflected flashes of light like shoals of fish across the full width of her bare shoulders.   

800377
Benetton and Ford are showing signs of anxiety. 
Neither of them seemed wholly convinced when the team manager, Peter Collins, took the audacious decision to recruit the 25-year-old Englishman at the start of the year but it looked a good deal brighter when Herbert burst on to the F1 scene with a <tag "538323">brilliant</> drive to finish fourth in his first grand prix, the Brazilian.

A stunning collection of freedom songs put together with the help of the Neville Brothers. 
The 1982 song Libete by the Magnum Band is the highlight &dash. a <tag "538323">brilliant</> dance track.

Anyhow they preferred modern concrete rather than mud-brick. 
El Gourna represented in fact that kind of gap that is often identified in Utopian social projects and that emerges between the good, in this case <tag "538323">brilliant</>, concept and a half-baked social programme.   

800380
The lights would be bright and strong and the music dignified, an orchestra. 
They would drink punch from the de Voincourts' silver bowls and lots of champagne, and soldiers would wait upon them in white gloves, dress uniforms. 
A young lieutenant approached and asked her to dance so diffidently that she flashed him Anne-Marie's most <tag "538441">brilliant</> smile and said she'd be delighted.

For those who might have forgotten, the official news agency listed the lines from his best known performances &dash. `emancipation of the mind; seeking truth from facts; setting things right; carrying forward the revolutionary cause and forging ahead into the future". 
China, a sombre evening newscaster announced, was saying farewell to `an outstanding Marxist, a staunch communist, a <tag "538325">brilliant</> proletarian revolutionary, statesman and military strategist and long-tested leader of our party and country."   

800382
I don't want to be a spoilsport, but my money is on somewhere between the launderette and home. 
This mediocrity is being challenged by the <tag "538323">brilliant</> observational skill of such people as John Mendoza, Larry Miller and Dana Gould, all of whom appeared at the festival and will probably be in London in the autumn, and a revitalised political tradition represented by Bill Hicks and Will Durst.

And, of course, there are Desert Orchid's never to be forgotten great triumphs climaxing in last year's Cheltenham Gold Cup which always provides fascinating viewing, however many times it is seen, as the 11-year-old's sheer courage turned what seemed imminent defeat into a marvellous victory. 
Trainer David Elsworth together with jockeys Colin Brown, Simon Sherwood and Richard Dunwoody, who have all partnered Desert Orchid, provide a further insight into the flying grey with their comments as his glittering career develops. 
But above all it again highlights his <tag "538323">brilliant</> jumping and battling qualities which have captured the imagination of the public.   

800385
Suddenly Wolves panicked, a minute later, Paul Simpson ran clear, he had done on two previous occasions, and missed good chances. 
This time he didn't miss, he shot past Stowell and United were on level terms, amazingly, they almost snatched the lead a minute later when a <tag "538323">brilliant</> save by Stowell denied Simpson once again.

PAUL Simpson failed by just four shots to land a dream place in the 119th British Open Championship in his final qualifying round yesterday. 
Having posted a <tag "538323">brilliant</> 66 on Sunday on the first day of the Scotscraig qualifying round, Burford's young assistant professional was lying three just three strokes behind first round leader Mark Clayton of Australia and in a group of five, which included Spaniard Manuel Pinero.

Strett kicked a penalty soon after the break. 
Although the crowd wanted to see tries, they didn't complain too vigorously when Strett added another penalty to regain the lead. 
After 68 minutes Bryan Barley intercepted on his own 22 metre line and the supporting Simon Holmes released Heslop to race half the length of the field for a <tag "538323">brilliant</> try.

However, the pace and venom of Walker, with at times eight fielders behind the stumps, was too much for Wolvercote. 
Three <tag "538323">brilliant</> slip catches &dash. two by A. Bowles and one by P. Lock &dash. gave Walker well-deserved wickets and he finished with 4 for 50 in 17.5 overs.

A recession would cut back London's traffic but so long as the economy keeps growing, the result will be more cars, more traffic and more pollution. 
Mr Parkinson can turn his back on all this but if he decides to confront it, road pricing is one of the few tools at his disposal.

`Lyric poets tend to finish early," Rickword once said.

`He is a world-class player," Finney said, `with every bit as much skill as Maradona, Van Basten or Gullit.

The man who executed Bourne in Tam Quan took his name and agreed to be trained for an operation that we called Treadstone Seventy-one, after a building on New York's Seventy-first Street, where he went through a brutal indoctrination programme.

`We were not tight enough, and the way in which we lost the battle in midfield did not please me, but it is important to remember that the Brazilians are a very good side.

The black bitch has had to settle for second place on her last two opens round here, but should take care of Night Cap and Maias Mischief and return to winning ways. 
On the graded front, John Peterson's Square Windows couldn't cope with the <tag "538323">brilliant</> early pace of Cocktail Charm on Saturday, but with Tony Meek's charge out of the way in the A1 over 450 metres, can get his head in front tonight.

The William Hill Super Trapper winner never gave his followers an anxious moment when trotting up by just under five lengths in the fastest time of the night, a calculated 26.98. 
Meek had a good night when flying the flag for Oxford by getting Plough Jack, Tsetse Bruce and Cocktail Charm through to tonight's second round. 
The latter showed <tag "538323">brilliant</> early pace to almost deny fancied Longcross Rocky.

SUCH has been the restrained nature of Scotland's build-up to this afternoon's match against Costa Rica that it is all but impossible to judge whether what has been bottled up will come fizzing and frothing to the surface or merely dribble out, flat and undistinguished. 
No banners have been raised, no glorious poses struck. 
The Scotland team manager's most exuberant declaration here prior to today was that a 2-0 victory would be `an absolutely <tag "538323">brilliant</> result".

It's almost as if, Mara pointed out, she has made the running of the house, the serving of meals, and the secrets of the linen cupboard a whole State, with all the importance and changes of policy which Government requires. 
Whether this was really the `tragedy" that Mara claims, of the loss of a <tag "538322-x">brilliant</> talent &dash. so common a fate among women &dash. and its submersion in the mundane details of everyday life, I wouldn't be able to say; I only know that it took some time to return Robina to the subject of the evening of Monday the ninth of February.

They completed the course during the lunch interval in 6min 30sec. 
Sam Mackenzie, the six-times winner of the Diamonds, was angrily told to leave the course by the chairman, Peter Coni OBE QC, when he attempted to scull down it and two women who unfurled a banner opposite the enclosure saying Stop Nuclear Dumping in the Thames were dragged away in their boat by the Thames Water Authority.

This particular novelty was the third short orchestral piece to appear in the last few years, written, like the second, at Knussen's prompting, and it rounded off a performance of all three as a suite, titled Three Occasions for Orchestra.

The weeping willow-leaved pear Pyrus salicifolia `Pendula", produces creamy April blossoms, but is grown mainly for its shimmering fountain of silvery-grey foliage. 
April is one of the best months for planting evergreens, so if you fancy a small weeping evergreen with <tag "538324">brilliant</> autumn berries, look for Cotoneaster `Hybridus Pendulus", a prostrate cotoneaster grown on a stem to make an attractive weeping tree.

THE British Grand Prix at Silverstone marked the halfway point of the 1989 world championship, and after Sunday's race many people in the pit lane were left wondering whether Alain Prost might have been premature in his decision to stand down from the McLaren team next season.

That experience, along with a desire to follow Kevin Keegan in playing football at the highest level, away from the constraints of the English game, helped persuade Cunningham to join Real Madrid the following year for just under #1 million. 
The prospect of an English footballer filling a position once occupied by Francisco Gento was an intriguing one, but Cunningham soon discovered that underlying the <tag "538323">brilliant</> individualism of Spanish football was a brutality which is still there today.

Marc Almond has always been the master of lavish disco ballads and his many fans won't be disappointed by Enchanted (Parlophone), his latest collection of over-the-top, more-than-slightly camp, operatic songs, in which he shows those young pretenders Erasure just how this sort of stuff should be done.

FOR cinephiles on this side of the rapidly rusting Iron Curtain, the received thumbnail history of Russian cinema would run roughly as follows: an enormous eruption of talent in the post-Revolutionary years with the early masterpieces of Eisenstein, Pudovkin and Dziga Vertov; hard times, Socialist Realism and artistic crudity under Stalin; thwarted but none the less <tag "538323">brilliant</> careers for a few visionaries like Tarkovsky; and, finally, the post-glasnost films which comment on the ills of contemporary society and the horrors of the Stalinist past.

Populist advice on the choosing and hanging of pictures often suggested the suitability of particular subjects for specific rooms: `For a room which is distinctly masculine in feeling a powerful sea picture would be good." 
Furthermore, their practical potential within interior design was stressed: `Take, for instance, a <tag "538324">brilliant</>, sun-drenched modern scene: hang any one of these in a sun-shy north room, and almost like magic it seems to put a sunny window where no sun ever shines."
