The vesicles are separated from one another by thin films of glass, so that air can be  trapped inside, enabling the pumice to <tag "523221">float</>.

Outside, and due to the inclemency of the weather, the blue cut stone may have imparted a lugubriousness to passersby, but inside all was gleaming, as befits a place which houses God. 
The sanctuary lamp, perpetually alight, was of Paduan silver hanging low on lattice chains, its bowl pierced with holes containing the inner red bowl in which the sacred oil first glugged, then swayed; here too <tag "523221">floated</> the wick with its tongue of sacred flame bespeaking the presence of Christ.

The latter is within CB's competence to remedy. 
Cardif, the insurance company, and Cortal, the asset management division of CB, have both grown too slowly recently for the group's taste.

`You must also take into account the effect on world trade and on the wider currency position." 
For good measure, Mrs Thatcher added: `Also, perhaps you remember that Bretton Woods broke in spite of all the best intentions." 
Bretton Woods, the post-war system of fixed exchange rates, broke down in March 1973, nine months after Edward Heath decided to <tag "523225">float</> sterling.

Warehouseman Lee Seary is secretly glad his six-year old son became tired while playing a pike &dash. because he took over and landed a personal best 27 lb specimen.

They in fact came fifth, but it shows that anglers from out of the area know the Thames as well as local anglers, and on that occasion their experience showed. 
Next Sunday the Thames at Radley will see a match between Abingdon and District and Kidlington Angling Club, and everyone aiming to take part is advised that only <tag "523219">floats</> will be allowed.

But we knew by now the deceitful ways in which he could arrive; and we were ready. 
As the searchlights played across the skies, barrage balloons <tag "523235">floated</> on their cables, grim-faced men in khaki stared out across the North Sea; entertained each night, it must be said, by Elsie and Doris Waters.

Fourth was Stuart Beresford of Dorking with 14-9-0 of roach and perch from peg 9, and the fifth man, who collected #40, was international angler Steve Gardener who had 14-8-0 of bream caught with <tag "523248-a">float</> tackle.

Regardless of road conditions, the SL always feels firm, but thanks to excellent damping, it can still dismiss ridges and pot holes with consummate ease. 
There is not the faintest trace of <tag "523271">float</> or wallow over the fastest crests or in the steepest dips; the body just maintains constant ride height throughout giving a feeling of invincible security.

It is likely the new regime will have to write down the value of some of the group's assets.

Sir: 
If John Smith really tries to make the Department of Trade and Industry into a department equal to the Treasury (an idea last <tag "523236">floated</>, surprisingly enough, by Norman Tebbit during his short tenure as Secretary of State), he will fail just as George Brown did.

We had to build sound `towers" by the stage to get the music amplification right. 
With Billy Graham again at the Lausanne Olympic Stadium in 1974, we had made no allowance for the effect of the wind on sound &dash. it blows it around like rain.

Mr Isaacs and other executive directors are accepting the offer in respect of their combined holding of 22.7 per cent. 
The offer is conditional on acceptance by holders of 85 per cent of the total. 
GAN publicly stated its intention to <tag "523224">float</> on the stock market a year ago but these plans have had to be put back because General Portfolio does not have sufficient distributable reserves from which to pay dividends to shareholders.

But he believes the company, which gets 90 per cent of its sales overseas, will hit #12m next year.

There are some rather interesting feminist theologians in America who are redefining God as female, but they can't really get rid of all the metaphysical baggage of Christianity.

The fault system is part of the great `Pacific rim of fire" &dash. a zone of vulcanism and seismicity which girdles the entire ocean. 
The outer, rigid, surface of the earth is divided &dash. like a cracked egg &dash. into great tectonic plates which, driven from within by the vast energy of the earth's molten core, are moving sluggishly relative to each other.

Installation of these devices proved costly and very few were used. 
The <tag "523373">floating</> mill, moored to a bridge or pier in the cities, solved this problem, but in the country the miller had to moor in open stream and grain had to be conveyed to him by boat.

But there is a strong case for taking all the medicine at once. 
A <tag "523378">floating</> exchange rate is a highly effective barometer of international confidence and it exerts a powerful discipline on an economy because it exposes inefficient industry to the winds of international competition.

It required astounding computer power, stunning quantities of fuel, mesmerising safety checks, the design of a module that could never work on earth and a series of heart-stopping risk assessments. 
It involved pressure suits that looked like balloons and weighed 185 lbs, duplicated failsafe life support systems, fuel cells, food that wouldn't leave crumbs <tag "523235">floating</> in freefall and (everybody always asks this question) plastic bags for post-nutritive disposal substances.

The third and most stylistically daring example, Au Moulin Rouge ou La Promenade &dash. La Goulue et Jane Avril au fond (Fig. 136), focuses on the strollers at the periphery of the dance-hall rather than the dancers and includes the figure of La Goulue with her hands on her hips and that of Jane Avril dancing in the background. 
In Au Moulin Rouge ou La Promenade, Lautrec not only exploited contrasts between sketchily stroked and flatly painted areas, but carried further a device he had begun to use in 1890 in Au Moulin Rouge, la danse &dash. that is, stylizing the trains of women's gowns into elongated, flat, curving shapes <tag "523310">floating</> across the picture plane.

In 1985 North Sea output transformed a non-oil deficit of #5.6bn into an overall surplus of #3.2bn.

On stormy nights it had been exhilarating to fly in the teeth of the wind. 
Hard to steer, to balance, to <tag "523221">float</>, she had learned instead to consent; to cast herself onto the wind and learn the whole length and depth and height of its strength, and in perfect relaxation, the stern corseting of gravity left far below, her whole body had been open to power and loveliness.

Fenna was the dark force of the imagination as well as its golden dancing; Fenna was chaos as well as order, and brought, on fiery dragon breath, the full danger of the chasm. 
Maggie could play safely with Fenna and explore the land of dark flames and reversed colours that lies in the pit of disorder; Maggie could ride the rough neck, clinging to the glittering scales and interpret the wreaths of smoke that drifted from Fenna's nostrils when the great beast played at being tame. 
Maggie was safe because she never thought to deny Fenna's powers and <tag "523223? or 523235?">floated</> with them, but the older women suffered under the assaults of this strange visitor from within the dreaming self.

Though undeniably more exciting, they are scarcely more acceptable than the resort to the drawing of lots which threatened at one stage to determine which teams went on from Group F and which fell by the Sicilian wayside. 
Such methods should only be used when no mechanism which reflects the course of the game is available; and that was not the case with the Ireland-Romania match. 
One solution <tag "523236">floated</> last week was to take into account the disciplinary records of the teams: on that basis, the teams which had seen the fewest red and yellow cards flourished against them would have finished top of a tied Group F. Such a system might hang rather too much on the varying standards of discipline practised by referees, but so in a sense does the World Cup contest as a whole, particularly when offenders are banned from subsquent matches.

She is alone, she has recently been jilted, she has dreamed of her lover on a swing with his wife, both of them moving through the air, charmed, assured creatures. 
Great copious tears run down her face onto her neck, and as they reach her breastbone she shivers. 
These tears blind her so that the red tiles of the floor appear to be curving, the roses on the bedspread <tag "523310">float</> as if on a lake, and the beaded eyes of the teddy bear glint at her with malice.

Have it laid on." 
If Robyn had shown any sign of being bothered by this, Vic would have taken Everthorpe aside and told him to leave it out; but she responded with stony indifference, and Vic wasn't averse to keeping Everthorpe guessing whether he and Robyn Penrose were having an affair, ridiculous as the idea was. 
Ridiculous, yet there was a kind of pleasure to be got from letting it <tag "523309 or 523221-m">float</> idly in the stream of one's thoughts, driving to and from work.

And since Gunnel Bohman's Countess (in keeping with Rattle's most overt break with the usual Figaro tradition) has to proceed at a rush through Porgi amor, and even pretty fast through Dove sono and Canzonetta sul aria (the letter scene), she is unable to establish the spiritual security from which she draws her compassion for Almaviva.

Our actual vibrating rush down the runway and our lift into flight and the clunk of the withdrawn landing gear did not distract her from her rapt appreciation of the interior invention: a participatory jet engine for each passenger, with a cream-colored pointed cone of plastic in its center similar to the metallic cones at the rear of the impossibly heavy GE engines outside, whose turbines ground slowly in and out of phase. 
It was a calming bit of self-paced instruction in the behavior of compressible fluids; it was even a useful deception of sorts, since after an hour of feeling that spotlight of air playing over your face, your thoughts full of the remembered sight of contrails in a blue sky as seen from earth &dash. the way they first appear like narrow staves of music a little way behind a very high plane, and gradually fatten into shaving-cream crudities before fading &dash. or of cold rides in the back of pickup trucks, when your cheek nerves grew deadened to the insistent flapping of a lock of hair that now doesn't exist, or of the print ad for Maxell tape in which a man sits in an armchair and experiences a blast of La Mer from his speakers that sinks him deep into the cushions and flings his tie over his shoulder and tips the shade of the standing lamp, you began to think that if the real jet engines were to fail, the plane would <tag "523391">float</> to earth on the output of these tame little verniers alone, as in the parlor trick in which ten guests each use one finger to lift a heavy volunteer &dash. and as the plane lost altitude and the captain flipped desperately through the technical manuals muttering

The twin-spotted wainscot moth  lays its eggs in the bur reed, but the larvae later transfer to the common reed as they fatten up and need a thicker stem to tunnel  into.

These outbursts marked the end of  the entire eruption, for at 2.30 p.m. on the twenty-eighth, after being  active for a hundred days, the last, mild explosion echoed out over  Krakatoa, and silence returned. 
Slowly, life returned to something like normal in the Straits, and the  bewildered survivors were able to bury their dead, and salvage what they  could of homes in towns and villages that had been swept by tsunamis and  showered with ash. 
Initially, the great masses of <tag "523373">floating</> pumice which had piled up on the  sea made it difficult for ships to force their way through the water &dash.  rafts three metres thick were reported in places &dash. but eventually parties  were able to reach the islands and determine what changes had taken place.

In case that sounds an extravagant claim, let me explain. 
The belief that we may have reached some kind of political watershed is not related to anything the Labour Party may have said or done (though Neil Kinnock, I suspect, did himself a bit of good with the <tag "523237">floating</> television voter on Tuesday).

A nuee consists of an incandescent mass of solid fragments, buoyed up by  the rush of expanding, heated gases. 
The escaping gases rise upwards,  forming a turbulent, dynamic wall, while the denser part, containing  most of the solid material, hugs the ground and rolls rapidly over it,  travelling at great speed, since each particle of the solid material is  in a more or less <tag "523235-a">floating</> condition, cushioned by escaping gas like a  hovercraft.

The Government is desperate to avoid anything which would delay the accident-prone sale of electricity further and jeopardise completion of the sell-off before the next election.

It does not necessarily remember whether it was hurt or not: it only remembers being afraid.

In days gone by he could remember it filled with dirty water and its surface largely covered with brown-edged plants resembling lilies and decaying leaves with a clump of rushes or sedge at one end. 
Now all that was gone and a tiled floor was revealed, many of the tiles gone altogether, others patchily covered with a hairy dark-green weed. 
Only one area was more or less clear, showing two naked female figures hand in hand as if swimming or <tag "523235">floating</> in mid-air.

The only appropriate one already exists: the Edwardian municipal palace paid for by the ratepayers of London which stands proudly on the banks of the Thames and which again could and should become a focus of civic pride.

Ordinary pumice, by contrast, shows a wide range in density, depending  upon the degree of vesiculation that has taken place in the magma, but  it is still nothing more than a solidified rock froth. 
The vesicles are separated from one another by thin films of glass, so that air can be  trapped inside, enabling the pumice to float. 
Sometimes, when a volcano erupts in the sea, massive carpets of <tag "523373">floating</>  pumice accumulate on the sea around it and may drift a long way from it.

Such horses become the weavers, cribbers, and wind-suckers of the equine world. 
These forms of repetitive and obsessive behaviour become so ingrained in the horse, that they become part of the horse's ordinary behaviour even when it is not bored. 
So the weaver rocks from side to side in the <tag "523220">float</> as it is transported down the road, the cribber latches on to a fence post between mouthfuls of food, and the wind-sucker, out in a large paddock with other horses, may prefer to swallow air rather than eat the grass.

Labour planners will be told by the Shadow Communications Agency that only about a third of the Greens" spectacular 15 per cent of last month's vote was comprised of Green activists with predominantly global concerns about environmental issues like ozone depletion and the destruction of tropical forests. 
Two-thirds, <tag "523237">floating</> voters from all the older parties, are said to be unaware of the Greens' more radical anti-growth proposals and are motivated by concern over pollution in their immediate environment.

Despite persistent questioning from journalists, no more substantial ground for opposing the idea was forthcoming.

She decided to seek him out at his lodgings. 
It was a house not far from the chapel &dash. one of the five or six terraced houses with a tiled hallway and a stained-glass fanlight over the door that shone ruby or blue or green <tag "523310-a">floating</> patterns on the floor, depending on the position of the sun.

But Khrushchev's next visit to the West was one of sweetness and light, to Britain at the invitation of Eden. 
He and his straight man, Bulganin, came by battle cruiser, which was the target of much curiosity in Portsmouth harbour, especially since the body of a naval frogman, Commander `Buster" Crabbe, had been found <tag "523221">floating</> there during another Russian naval visit the previous autumn.

An opposition-backed attempt in parliament to vote on the burning issue of how the new president should be elected was blocked by Communist deputies, who halted proceedings by rising to their feet and bellowing the national anthem. 
Opposition circles outside parliament <tag "523236">floated</> the suggestion that Czechoslovakia's most famous explorer, Jiri Hanzelka, might break the deadlock by standing as a `unity" candidate.

The affidavit included a monitored conversation between Quigley and Johnson on May 27 in which the two men allegedly discussed methods of downing helicopters with high-bore machine guns and missiles. 
`Quigley described his own idea of <tag "523235-a or 523235">floating</> balloons with Kevlar ropes attached to grenades with the aim of entangling the rope in the helicopter's rotor blades, thus drawing the grenade into the body of the helicopter," it said.

These last were not jettisoned. 
Aldrin on one of his missions had thrown some food bags out into the shining blackness: they <tag "523391">floated</> at five miles a second alongside the spacecraft and reflected light back at him and within minutes he mistook them for stars.

The measures were announced on Monday night by Antonio Erman Gonzalez, whose appointment last week made him the country's third economy minister since Mr Menem assumed office in July.

Since the last World War, soldiering, as a profession, had lost its romantic appeal, but in Vietnam the journalists were given the chance of acting out fantasies about themselves, war, love and death. 
The inherent exoticism of the place can have only added to its allure and, for those whose tastes tended in that direction, the soft purring caresses and total availability of the bar-girls must have seemed irresistible. 
John Swain, describing returning to Phnom Penh after a thirteen-year absence, wrote wistfully of the now vanished maisons flottantes (<tag "523373">floating</> brothels) and the old Cafe&acute. de Paris cyclo-girls who would coo `Aller avec vous ce soir, Monsieur".

BRITISH &and. Commonwealth Holdings, John Gunn's troubled financial services conglomerate, is selling off its development capital arm and will reorganise its venture capital operations in the new year. 
The development capital side, defined by B &and. C as funding new ventures, is being hived off in a quoted vehicle, Colonnade Development Captial, which B &and. C first <tag "523224">floated</> on the stock market in October 1988.

Details of the document published today in the newsletter Power in Europe show that the estimated proceeds from the sale of the entire industry could be as little as #11bn, which is a fraction of the assets. 
It admits problems in <tag "523224">floating</> the industry at a `defensible" price while taking expensive measures to protect the environment, paying for a nuclear power programme, and at the same time introducing competition.

Single horse floats are too claustrophobic for a horse, and there is no room for a companion. 
A companion horse who is used to being floated, if  floated with the beginner can make the difference between success and disaster. 
The large trucks that are used by professional carriers where the horse is sealed up in almost complete darkness and isolation, frighten horses more than two-horse <tag "523220">floats</> pulled by cars or the more open trucks frequently used by professional riders.

He built them a pagoda of solid jade and embellished it with precious gems &dash. not realising that to grow up a dragon must accumulate its own hoard, must steal it from Emperors and princes. 
He had a pond dug for them, so pretty and sweet, surrounded by bullrushes with a delicate arched bridge and <tag "523221-x">floating</> with water lilies &dash. Not realising that a real dragon needs a whole ocean to sport in, needs the spume of the white capped waves, needs the great storms and clanging icebergs, needs the coral islands of the southern seas, needs the dark rains and winds and currents to make its blood flow green and its whiskers curl ferociously.

Turning from downwind to base at around 500 feet I found that you could almost pull the throttle completely back and make a glide approach.

The Dow Jones rose 39.83 to close at 2584.41.

Compared to Venturi, SITE has had rather more ambitious and frequently surrealist purposes. 
The supermarket, the fast-food joint, the parking lot have all been projects of the practice: but a Macdonalds which <tag "523221">floats</>, a parking lot with 20 cars deeply buried under asphalt, and its most celebrated work, the series of catalogue stores for the Best company where boxes are smashed into and eroded, with trees growing through them, fac&cedilla.ades peel or tilt, distorting the relationships between the predictable elements of the landscape.

Mr Havel, 53, the country's first non-Communist head of state for more than four decades, was nominated by the Communist Prime Minister, Marian Calfa, and elected by a unanimous vote of the Federal Assembly. 
Previous attempts by the Communists to frustrate Mr Havel's election by <tag "523236">floating</> other candidates, and making the superficially enticing suggestion that a nationwide ballot, rather than a vote of MPs, should elect the President, have failed.

Industry executives still believe the Government has set itself a formidably tight timetable if the industry is to be sold off before the next election. 
It now seems increasingly likely that ministers will be forced to <tag "523224">float</> National Power and PowerGen simultaneously early in 1991.

Around 12 parents and their babies are in the pool at one time. 
Infants become water-friendly through songs and exercises; for example, <tag "523373">floating</> toys encourage the children to stretch and pull themselves through the water.
