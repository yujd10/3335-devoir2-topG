Since birth they have had to fit in two hours of physiotherapy daily in order to survive and their one hope is `a cure" which embryonic research has brought in reach. 
How can a <tag "532735">band</> of vociferous and woolly-minded objectors deny the hope of life to thousands of young sufferers by stopping this vital research for the sake of a few unformed embryonic cells?

THE Glenn Miller Orchestra turned back the clock for an evening of solid gold nostalgia at the Apollo theatre, Oxford, on Saturday. 
From the tune Anchors Away right through to In The Mood the young big band under the expert direction of band leader Ray McVay perfectly recreated the Miller sound. 
The voices of Sarah Gilbertson and Tony Mansell were joined by three more from the <tag "532736">band</> as the Moonlight Serenaders to give us the cool harmonies of Miller's original Modernairs.

Crawling out from the wreckage of The Cateran, the Joyriders feature two ex-members, Murdo MacLeod and Kai Davidson, plus one tall American named Rick on drums. 
It takes four songs for them to shake off their own ghost, but halfway through the aptly named `Long Gone" it disappears. 
In the process they've lost a certain edge, for at the end The Cateran had the rage and the fury of a <tag "532736">band</> at its peak falling apart.

Seriously funny." 
Meanwhile, the show is nearly over and the <tag "532736">band</> strike up `I Love You Love".

But no judge was unsympathetic to the dilemma in which a natural mother found herself. 
Mr McCormick submitted that if any one of the mother's reasons was possibly valid then it could not be said that the mother's refusal to consent was outside the reasonable <tag "532734">band</>.

The headsail wardrobe currently consists of a non-overlapping working jib set on a furler, originally designed to cope with wind speeds between 10 and 35 knots plus. 
But Mary feels it is too small for the lower wind speeds, so she may introduce an overlapping furler for the 10 to 18 knot <tag "532734">band</>.   

800010
Although wine shops are doing an increasingly good job with single malts, it takes a specialist to do justice to these extraordinarily diverse spirits. 
The malts vary so much that a growing <tag "532735">band</> of devotees collects them, comparing the Lowlanders and Highlanders, or the product of one island with that of the next.  

800011
Since 1945, West Germany has become a `normal" liberal democracy, with close affinities to the political systems of other western countries. 
These countries, too, have their unreconstructed fascists and nazis, their residual lunatic right-wing fringe, and their broader <tag "532734">bands</> of sympathizers with various aspects of rightist thinking.

SUNDAY: 
Paul Ince joins the growing <tag "532735">band</> of midfielder-turned defenders with a fine display in Manchester United's televised 1-0 win over Nottingham Forest, but United show few signs of having shaken off their current malaise.   

800014
On this occasion, she backed C. Day-Lewis and she was an efficient operator. 
She persuaded Edmund Blunden to retire from the contest and stand again next time. 
C. S. Lewis's opponents were thus united in a single <tag "532735">band</>.   

800015
So, one fine morning the magazine's publisher and feature writer received a notice informing them that Steven Morrissey and Johnny Marr were proceeding with an action for defamation of character. 
It seemed bizarre that a <tag "532736">band</> plagued by such huge problems on an international scale should wish to waste their time attempting to sue a small time and, to be frank, penniless magazine. 

800016
Nothing that emerged from either of these companies ever seemed particularly daring, imaginative or stirring. 
Similarly, after the first wave of enthusiasm for the films from Channel 4 had died down, it was clear that its drama director, David Rose, was more interested in television drama than cinema. 
British filmmakers were working in too narrow an aesthetic <tag "532734">band</>, defined largely by television and at no point making any connection to the cinema culture that had last flourished in the late 1940s. 

800017
JESUS JONES Liquidizer (Food FOODLP 3) Appropriately titled, Liquidizer is a particularly abrasive variant on today's blender-culture music, mixing together garage punk guitars, house rhythms and samples, and pop-wise melodies. 
The <tag "532736">band's</> debut hit single `Info Freako" is typical of the method used throughout: every sound here reaches one's ears through a variety of effects boxes; the feverish scratch of guitars, wail of voices and babble of samples are all treated, phased, echoed and otherwise distorted out of shape and harnessed to a steady beat somewhere &dash. according to the helpful sleeve annotations &dash. between 110 and 125 beats per minute.

WHEN DISCUSSING the results from 140 ILEA schools (4 July) Harvey Goldstein and Desmond Nuttall highlight `the advantage of analysing pupil performance rather than aggregate school data". 
Their study, based on analysis of pupils" results in achievement tests &dash. exam results at 16+ &dash. compares these with the pupils' verbal reasoning <tag "532903">band</> on entry to secondary school.

`Music was a kind of hobby for me then and I didn't give it a thought as a way of making money." 
His early training on tenor served him well when he joined the army in 1951 and he spent all but two months of his service in an army <tag "532736">band</> at Fort Dix.   

800020
This works to `dull" a band's sense of adventure and as the work rate intensifies, it is a natural reaction to concentrate on artistic input and leave the fundamentals (tour organisation and administrative chores) to those employed for the purpose. 
A rumour began to circulate around the cocktail bars of the music biz e&acute.lite that The Smiths were unhappy with Rough Trade and, although still tied with contracts, were seeking to move away. 
Obviously every record company in Britain wasted no time in sniffing out the possibilities of picking up the <tag "532736">band</>. 

800021
In that final respect, the Healey was like the Cobra, but the Cobra didn't even have external door handles, just simple pulls inside which you reach in to open. 
There was no space for two small children or one transversely-mounted adult, not a trace of walnut, and if you wanted to listen to a radio in a Cobra you'd have needed speakers that wouldn't have disgraced a heavy-metal <tag "532736">band</>. 

800022
The NME succumbed to The Smiths success by parading a lengthy Smiths interview by Biba Kopf, a writer not known for his enthusiasm for the Smiths. 
Although hardly succeeding in exposing the conflict between the <tag "532736">band's</> artistic stance and their situation (which was the probable intention), the dual interview of Morrissey and Marr did, for once, produce worthy quotes.   

800023

`I'd rather be a solo singer like Madonna." 
Having been together for over a year, FHC see the <tag "532736">band</> as a good professional experience.  

800025
Not as hopeless as expected but still a million miles from anything approaching relevance or interest. 
Stereotyical old dance beats, the same old rave mentality &dash. and will therefore sell by the bucketload. 
If this is how <tag "532736">bands</> who openly admit to being influenced by The Clash sound today, poor old Strummer and Jones can't be getting much sleep at night.   

800026
Kenny `Pancho" Hagood was one of several fine baritone singers who patterned their styles on that of the influential Billy Eckstine in the 1940s. 
Like Earl Coleman, Johnny Hartman and Arthur Prysock, Hagood started his career as a <tag "532736-a">band</> singer and was featured from 1946 to 1948 with the Dizzy Gillespie orchestra. 

800027
As somebody once said, celibacy lies next to orgasm. 
What Morrissey still can't come to terms with is that now, for some strange reason, hordes of people profess to have fallen in love with him and previous to the <tag "532736">band</>, he often states, no girl ever even took him into consideration.   

800028
In all, 255 young trees were planted, a huge task which was completed by the garden team at Nymans in ten days and which has already gone a good way towards restoring the diversity of colours, shapes and textures of conifers in their prime. 
GIs, Wrens, Waafs, splendidly moustachioed Flying Officers and even the odd Rear Admiral brought the 1940s back to Chartwell, Sir Winston Churchill's home in Kent, at the beginning of June when dancing to the Big <tag "532765-a">Band</> sound of Syd Lawrence Orchestra continued into the early hours in a huge marquee decked out with the flags of the Allies. 

800029
But a new career opened up for him. 
He had played with the Eric Robinson Orchestra at the BBC and in the marvellous band which backed the Goon Show. 
He was in the <tag "532736">bands</> for Crackerjack and the Benny Hill Show.   

800030
It was virtually non-esistent pre-war and early post-war. 
The only real enthusiasts were the <tag "532735">band</> of 100 or so owners of pre-1905 cars that took part in the annual London to Brighton Commemorative Run.   

800031
Photograph (omitted): A woman taking a photograph of a mural in Deptford, south-east London, based on the theme of Love Over Gold, a record album by the group Dire Straits. 
The album had been inspired by graffiti spotted on the wall when a member of the <tag "532736">band</>, Mark Knopfler, lived on the nearby Crossfields estate   

800033
Needless to say, they were well primed for The Smiths. 
The band caused a sensation on New Year's Eve, helping to produce, by all accounts, a classic evening. 
Joe Moss, however, was beginning to feel ill at ease as the rest of the <tag "532736">band</> indulged in typical rock 'n' roll trappings that were at odds with Morrissey's stated philosophy. 

800034
This said, the gig did finish with a mass stage invasion, another example of the band gathering an intensely fanatical following. 
The tour was appropriately chaotic, as most rock tours are: their first taste of the twenty-four hour a day, day to day flogging to which they would have to submit in order to compete. 
Days of casual romanticism were seemingly lost and dark cliche&acute.-ridden existence of the typical `on the road" <tag "532736">band</> was, it appeared, the only possible future.   

800035
The Tourist Office have a weekly programme in high season offering something to do every day, such as Punch and Judy shows, guided walks through `Fairy Land", a fun fair, and special `kids only" rides on the Zillertalbahn Railway. 
There are also plenty of shops and open-air cafes, and, for your evening entertainment, bars and discotheques to suit all tastes. 
The Zillertal people are renowned for their love of singing, and throughout the season there are festivals of folk singing and dancing, plus, weather permitting, brass <tag "532744-a">band</> concerts taking place weekly from June to September.  

800036
TOP OF THE POPS The daddy, indeed the yardstick, of all modern pop shows. 
Chart-topping <tag "532736">bands</> play before swarming masses of hip-hopping teenagers, marshalled around the studio by clipboard-wielding floor-managers.   

800038
If you don't want us to be paid at all, we will do some other job." 
Playing to his audience who had been entertained by BA's own brass <tag "532744">band</> and the latest in corporate videos, 71-year-old Lord King craftily joked and blustered his way out of trouble at the meeting.   

800039
Nobody wanted to risk losing that interview. 
Those who thought that Morrissey's profile in 1984 was becoming detached from the rest of the <tag "532736">band</> certainly couldn't have appreciated the enormous media attention he generated in spring 1985. 

800040
But not for Pellow the mutual flattery and the chummy linking of arms which normally accompanies the invited guest. 
Gabriel, stranded in a frock-coat, stage right, had to settle for looking on in amazement, while Pellow ran amok, attempting to mount all the set's various staircases simultaneously. 
This <tag "532736">band</>, he seemed to be saying, is nobody's damp squib.  

800041
Most notably the spirit of celtic icon Van Morrison hangs over Primitive Man, while the busking spirit of Martin Stephenson and the Western swing of Lyle Lovett has invested the album with a stylistic diversity that never yields to the threat of banality and superficial style-hopping. 
It is a record that grows gently on you, and fulfills the <tag "532736">band's</> hope that they can make `not pop singles but good strong albums that sell well." 

800042
Or, `We've got to be high-tech, use computers" at the other. 
`All this American razzamatazz, we don't want it here" &dash. or, `Let's have balloons and <tag "532736">bands</> for everything."   

800043
What I got was a sadly disappointing mish-mash of statements (all curiously couched in military language) suggesting that the movement for the ordination of women was a `novelty" (as presumably was the break with Rome in the 1530s?); that all the fuss has been dreamt up by a secular society; and that the continued disunity in priesthood between men and women within the Anglican Church is a surefire way to promote some greater unity with Rome. 
Those calling for the ordination of women seem to have an impressive array of arguments to offer a Church responding to a changing society. 
Is it not about time Dr Leonard and his merry <tag "532735">band</> of clergymen present to us, in suitably analytical language, cogent reasons why they believe continued discrimination against women is necessary and, more importantly, justified?

Over the next decade Eric came to fame with the Count until he left to retire from music in 1972. 
But he picked up his career again when he rejoined Basie in 1975, and stayed with the <tag "532736">band</> under Frank Foster's leadership after Basie's death in 1984.

Though a little languid at low revs, a trait of multi-valve engines, the GT is a fast and willing revver which doesn't suffer the high-rev harshness of some 16- valvers. 
This encourages you to use the engine hard and exploit its strength in the mid-range to top-end of its performance <tag "532736">band</>.

Hotel guests are entitled to a 50% reduction on green fees at the 9-hole `golf academy" in the village. 
This luxurious hotel is rated amongst the top hotels in Austria, 450 years ago the building was a monastery, and the original parts of the structure with vaulted ceilings give added atmosphere to the Brau Keller (where a Tyrolean <tag "532736">band</> plays nightly).

It sounds pathetic but I'm also still quite awestruck when I talk to famous people." 
Ironically <tag "532736">bands</> feel the same way towards Peel.

Instead of talking a lot herself and making the family feel ignorant, she drew them out with questions about themselves. 
Raymond told her about his <tag "532736">band</> and Sandra told her about hairstyling and Gary told her about computer games and his father told her about how he and Vic's mother had married on thirty-five bob a week and hadn't considered themselves poor.   

800052
David Bowie `disappeared" to Berlin in the mid-Seventies to re-emerge with a stark album called `Low", wearing jodphurs, and exhibiting a tendency for Nazi salutes. 
Iggi Pop and Lou Reed, rock music's senior citizens of underground cool, both worked in Berlin, and by the early Eighties a whole group of younger, hero-worshipping New Romantic <tag "532736">bands</> were imitating the Berlin pose, shooting their videos in black and white from dramatic angles and affecting military headgear and leather overcoats. 

800053
`It should feel a bit more like going to a festival, where the peripheral things are always really important.

For 10 years until his retirement, Eric was area manager for a leisure investment company, but since retirement he has arranged top cabaret entertainment for hotels and clubs in the area, as well twice yearly cabarets at Didcot Civic Hall.

Holding court in the ritzy bar of Leeds Polytechnic, Cud guitar swinger Mike Dunphy is in a myth-exploding mood.

In complete contrast, the Mayfly's second production is The Young Visiters, adapted from the Victorian classic written by a naive young girl. 
David Chandler, who brings some of his work for the next art exhibition at the Old Fire Station (for four weeks from Tuesday) has a curriculum vitae which reads like a picaresque novel: singer with a punk <tag "532736">band</>; playwright; village postman; and shop assistant &dash. to name just some of his former occupations. 

800058
The result was a superbly percussive style which could also be tender and thoughtful. 
Hampton has always been a deeply rhythmical player: so much so that his big <tag "532765">bands</> have been criticised for espousing rhythm-and-blues, even though they included such great names as Clifford Brown, Charlie Mingus and Quincy Jones.

Mr Manship told us: `As well as enjoying the evening, those attending contributed #263 towards the cost of restoring our church centre, which is now back in use after being burnt out last year."

Back in San Francisco, he worked with several groups and then formed his own 11-piece band to play at Sweet's Ballroom in Oakland from 1938 to 1943. 
When trombonist Turk Murphy first heard this band in 1937 it consisted of a rhythm section, four brasses and three reed instruments that, as Murphy said, `never played together". 
Later Turk joined the <tag "532736">band</> himself. 

800061
A producer is chosen to mould the natural sound of the band into a new format, and the mesmerised band wander out of the studio clutching a product bearing little or no resemblance to the demo they went in with. 
As the battle for successs is so brutal, the band rarely complain. 
This accepted method of producing conveyor belt muzak also creates a huge gulf between the music of signed acts and that of unsigned acts of <tag "532736">bands</> on smaller independent labels. 

800062
There is even a gap in the centre with no flowers where the  material marking the ford was probably removed at a later date to allow passage for  the boats, leaving a silty bottom to the river in that place unsuitable for the growth of water crowfoot. 
Our predecessors' efforts to farm and drain the land can also be `read", again in  white and green, at a very different but particular moment of the year. 
If you  stand on a hill in winter when there is a thaw or look down from a motorway,  especially in the Midlands, you can hardly miss the pattern of long parallel <tag "533495">bands</>  of snow, which are always the last to go from the hollows of the old ridge and  furrow.   

800063
As ma and pa descend a downward spiral towards self-destruction, so the Kid shadows their progress in both his romance with a molten sweetheart known as Apollonia and his relations with the two women in his group, Wendy and Lisa. 
The moral climax comes with the attempted suicide of the Kid's father, after which the star sees the light, checks his egomania, mends his ways with the ladies and learns the value of sharing, as symbolised by the appearance of a Wendy and Lisa composition in the <tag "532736">band's</> stage set.   

800064
Their hardcore following don't seem to mind though and hap up every chorus of heartache with relish. 
Maybe Gedge and Co can fill the vacant Smiths throne after all. 
Anyone who remembers the magic of the wah way infested '60s, or indeed the brilliance of The Jam is probably far too old and knackered to go to gigs, so here's a chance to grab the best of both worlds, all in one <tag "532736">band</>!

As well as the painted decoration, the Eastons are fortunate in also having two good plaster ceilings.

YEATS FANS should keep a space in their diaries at 7.30pm on Sunday 29 Oct, when London's Royal Court Theatre is holding a special celebration entitled A Terrible Beauty to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the poet's death.

" is a tremendously powerful song, and shows off Jimmy Page as a great guitarist. 
Perhaps the reason Zeppelin were so despised after the punk revolution was the fact that they were the ultimate muso band. 
It's ironic that you should still make excuses for the fact that the <tag "532736">band</> can play really well, yet there's nothing here that can't be appreciated on the level of a blues number.

What a stage production brings out is that the film we know is hardly Bernstein at all. 
Only three of his 17 numbers were used &dash. including the evergreen New York, New York &dash. and among the `missing" 14 numbers there are three or four hauntingly sentimental Bernstein tunes full of unexpected twists, including Gabe's Lucky To Be Me and the ensemble song, Some Other Time, ingenious in its contrapuntal entries, not to mention a show-stopping point number, one of Bernstein's boyhood pieces, I Can Cook Too. 
The Guildhall School's big advantage is to have an orchestra on hand from the music department that vies with any theatre <tag "532736">band</> anywhere, and from the overture through to the playout music Chris Walker and his brilliant and brassy young team were electrifying.

Soukous, on the other hand, stuck fast, possibly because its light, tight-knit, fast rhythms were in direct contrast to the scattered harmonies of the rumba.

After an album like that one needs some serious silliness, which is this week provided by the B-52s, the classic exponents of American kitsch. 
It seemed that the <tag "532736">band</> were finished when guitarist Ricky Wilson died of cancer in 1985, just before Bouncing Off The Satellites was released, but now they are back, with Keith Strickland switching from drums to guitar, and a collection of guests (including former Gang Of Four bassist Sara Lee) providing the rhythm section.

However, considering the tightly controlled aloofness and the fact that Joyce (whose contributions in a musical capacity are not in doubt) has led a deliberately low profile, one cannot blame Kent for the omission.

Before the training staff begin asking for their P45s, it should be pointed out that it is the north Wales club's 35-seater bus, which has served them since 1979, that is up for sale. 
It was built to transport Foden's prize brass <tag "532744">band</>, and commercial operators and collectors should be aware that it will not be going for a song.

The most interesting findings, however, relate to the way in which these differences vary across schools. 
Gender differences, ethnic group differences and verbal reasoning <tag "532903">band</> differences themselves vary from school to school and from a study of these we begin to glimpse some fascinating insights into school differences.

It would be wise to review all investments to take full advantage of a wife's personal tax allowance and the fact she is also entitled to her own basic rate tax band. 
If the hus<tag "532734">band</> is a higher rate taxpayer and there is substantial investment income, a maximum of #3,1050 tax (at 1989-90 rates) can be saved by switching investments into the wife's name in order to maximise the benefit from her basic rate tax band.

At Heaton Park in Manchester a supposedly huge anti-heroin open air concert was being planned. 
The organisers had already begun to promise a strong local bill topped by the two biggest attractions in Manchester at the time, The Chameleons and, of course, The Smiths. 
This came as a surprise to the <tag "532736">band</> as they had never agreed to play the concert at all and they immediately issued a statement to this effect, fearing that many of their fans were being lured into buying tickets for a Smiths free event.

When trombonist Turk Murphy first heard this band in 1937 it consisted of a rhythm section, four brasses and three reed instruments that, as Murphy said, `never played together". 
Later Turk joined the band himself.

The railway police in the United States, who were known as `cinder dicks", had their origins in the lawless times when the railroads were pushing westwards across the continent.

A simple, single school-room with an entrance porch on the east side, it catered for the children of Shawell and the surrounding villages until after World War I. 
It is significant that even such a simple building as this was not immune from the stylistic preferences of contemporary architects and the steeply pitched roof-slopes of the schoolroom are `stratified" with <tag "533495">bands</> of alternating plain and fish-scale pattern tiles in true `High Victorian" fashion.

It's very difficult to put a finger on what it was that attracted me about him.

The fact that Smith was utterly and proudly northern and that The Fall has always encapsulated a northern way of life has lead to heavily denied speculation that The Smiths took their name from young Mark.

Hundreds of people queued during the day to climb up the tower to see the reason for the day's celebrations &dash. the church bells &dash. and to get an unsurpassed view over the countryside from the top.

William usually plays the euphonium in the Band and his mother Karen, the secretary of the Band, plays the trumpet, cornet, euphonium and the tenor horn. 
William's Uncle Brian, who is the Band's principle cornet player, was at the ceremony as were two of William's uncles who used to play in the Band; John, a trombone player and Mark, a cornet player. 
Karen said: `William has put a lot of time into the <tag "532736-p">Band</> in the past and its nice that they came to play for him."

VITAL RAF aircrew have been brought, in the words of one member, to `near mutiny" because they have been reduced to the same pay level as musicians. 
More than 320 Air Electronics Operators, most of whom fly in Nimrod anti-submarine and electronic warfare aircraft, were told last month that they were being switched to a lower pay <tag "532734">band</> and must wait until that group had caught up before receiving pay rises.

When we had a chance to view the boat from a distance with the wind at the bottom end of Force 6, we noticed that the overlapping headsail lost its shape quite badly when half-furled.

800125
Their audience was way beyond anything threatened by the revolutionary dogma of the Redskins and for the matter the NME. 
The writers' chart in the NME gave The Smiths a fair to low hearing, concentrating, as usual, on more obscure artifacts. 
In Sounds, the final round-up of the indie singles chart gave the <tag "532736">band's</> number one and two with `What Difference Does It Make" and `Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now" respectively with three other singles (if you count Sandie Shaw's little effort) in the top thirty.

In which case, what kind of threat is implied in the title's `Volume I"? 
Duran Duran's Decade (EMI DDX 10) has a sleeve featuring an even worse design sensibility than that at work on poor Robert Palmer's album, which is odd considering they were arguably the progenitors of the neatness fetish that followed the brief New Romantic boom of the early Eighties. 
The title, I suppose, is a none-too-subtle hint that they consider themselves to have as strong a claim as any on the title of <tag "532736-p">Band</> of the Decade, though what the record reveals is more the process of decay as it applies to their career.

CONSIDERING that jazz musicians are inclined to quote opera as being the most unjustly favoured of all minority arts, cornering sackfulls of public cash of which jazz sees but a tiny fraction, the advent of a jazz night on the Midland Bank's Proms season at the Royal Opera House might be construed as anything from a triumph to a tragic irony.

Bill Cotton, the son of another noted band leader, remembers what he believes was Henry Hall's final television appearance: `It was to mark a special TV anniversary and as one of the items Henry was invited to conduct an orchestra playing all the signature tunes of the big bands.

In one sense, private medical insurance offers the most flexible coverage of all, as you can reduce your costs in a variety of ways: by agreeing in advance to pay the first x-hundred pounds of any treatment yourself, known as an `excess"; by taking advantage of no-claims discounts; or by agreeing to stay in a `low <tag "532734">band</>" hospital, where accommodation is of a lower standard.

Buddy Holly, the first white rock `n" roller to wear glasses and lead his own <tag "532736">band</>, was dead at the age of twenty two; just think of the songs he wrote in that short time.   

800258
Figures in this year's Military Balance have not been revised to take account of the reductions of 500,000 troops and 10,000 tanks announced by Mikhail Gorbachev at the United Nations last December. 
Experts at the institute say that this year's figures, which include 6,700 more Warsaw Pact tanks than were previously thought to exist, mark the high tide of eastern bloc military might. 
YORK IS preparing to repel a <tag "532735">band</> of gypsies who have been travelling to the city for centuries.   

800259
Such imaginative concert planning deserves a more versatile acoustic, one which the Town Hall, for all its considerable virtues, does not possess. 
Webern's Six Orchestral Pieces, still perceptibly Romantic even with the pruned wind <tag "532736">band</> of 1928, emerged under Simon Rattle with enormous personality.  

800260
`Sometimes it was difficult to defend," says Norman, `because at the time rap was all dicks and gold. 
It was politically unsound, and that was the band's main argument against it." 
It was Norman's fellow <tag "532736-a">band</> members who insisted on the pseydonym.   

800261
The event marks its 50th anniversary this year, and to honour the annual classic, the management at Oxford plan to make it a memorable night. 
Among things on offer will be a jazz <tag "532736">band</> to welcome people to the Stadium.   

800262
And, even more crucially, the health of our children. 
Forget any accusations that here is a group of self-publicists jumping on the `<tag "532736-p">Band</> Aid" wagon; (right now, the role closest to these women's hearts is that of motherhood. 

800263
Their song `Happy Days" from their indie days was chosen to accompany a lager commercial on TV until a local Scottish tabloid discovered that (Shock! 
Horror!) the song was an attack on the Falklands war and also that the Shamen were an acid-gobbling baby-eating, Satan-worshipping <tag "532736">band</> of hate. 

800264
But its principal conductor, Trevor Pinnock, is British. 
Pinnock hopes to create a `Berlin Philharmonic of original instrument playing" with this new band whose possible guest conductors include Leonard Bernstein, not generally known for his `authentic performances". 
The Classical <tag "532736-p">Band's</> first concert received mixed reviews, Andrew Porter of the New Yorker declaring it `awful", others adopting a more circumspect wait-and-see attitude.   

800265
I try and explain this, telling them that, to my eternal shame, it all began as an ego thing really. 
YVES NAVARRE belongs to a select <tag "532735">band</> of contemporary French novelists whose work has been translated into English.  

800266
But he also developed fruitful musical partnerships with sophisticated Bop-derived players like pianist Georges Arvanitas and expatriate drummer Philly Joe Jones. 
During the 1980s Wright &dash. albeit without design &dash. played his part in the cross-fertilising of American jazz and the music of the wider world that has become a feature of the recent period. 
When Danish-born saxophonist John Tchicai formed his Orchestra of Two Continents, Wright was a part of it &dash. just as another key American avant-gardist of the 1960s, Archie Shepp became a regular member of the African/European <tag "532736">band</> Brotherhood of Breath.   

800267
Rough Trade ran the risk of losing The Smiths after creating the promotional success. 
The Smiths signed quickly to Rough Trade, a dangerous move, especially in the light of the slobbering cheque book waving majors. 
But it was a brave move and a sign that the <tag "532736">band</> held true to the courage of their convictions.   

800268
With the completion of the `Station To Station" album, rehearsals began for a new world tour which would open in February of the following year. 
David flew to Jamaica to meet up with the rest of the <tag "532736">band</>, but on his arrival he found that no arrangements had been made for his stay there.   

800269
The presentation on the night was another feather in the Stadium's cap. 
They had a jazz <tag "532736">band</> to welcome the patrons, and come the big race, a quartet of fanfare trumpeters from the Royal Greenjackets heralded the arrival of the finalists.   

800270
And though the suprise early closing of the bar peeved more than one punter (and certainly one reviewer), the blasting semi-hardcore rendition of `Bad Motorcycle" sent all home with a smile of their lips. 
No encore was needed, despite the clamour for one and the <tag "532736">band</> left knowing they'd converted all who had come with an open mind.   

800271
A week later they would be going mad for Def Leppard. 
All the <tag "532736">bands</> who we slagged off when we were in England." 

800272
One of those cowardly specimens who observably flinched in the football tackle or too noticeably avoided the sporadic playground rough and tumble. 
A worry-gut with too many improbable questions but also &dash. so far as most of the forty others in his class were concerned &dash. shamefully many of the right answers when the tough old lady with tightly bobbed hair and long blackboard pointer came stalking in squeaky lace-up boots up the narrow aisles between the desks. 
A boy who used to wander off alone into the tall trees which threatened the village and, as though in insolent reminder of their dominance, sent long poking fingers of animated shrub foraging between the dumpy houses, the stone chapel and the corrugated <tag "532736-a">band</> hot. 

800273
Wall Street's gyrations fuelled London's anxiety with see-sawing trade leaving the FT-SE 100 index 27.9 points lower at 2,135.5 &dash. its lowest in three months. 
The index rose and fell over a 61.5-point <tag "532736">band</>.   

800274
There was something overwhelmingly assured about this brief appearance. 
Like any other <tag "532736">band</> on the verge of defying all the odds by releasing their finest music to date, just when the public least expected it, they were joyously arrogant.   

800275
They were certainly not without a cultural infra-structure, having as I have already told you the statue of a black lady dressed as Queen Victoria. 
On the subject of drummers: Appleby, at my prep school, had a cousin who played in a naval dance <tag "532782">band</>, (something you never think about); and he served, for a short time, on a Free French destroyer. 

800276
Finally, a real curiosity from Britain's finest exponent of that most un-British instrument, the pedal steel guitar. 
BJ Cole has demonstrated his mournful, whining skills with home-grown country outfits like the Hank Wangford <tag "532736">band</>, and visiting Nashville superstars like Tammy Wynette, but now, let loose on a solo album, he veers right away from country to demonstrate steel guitar treatments of Debussy, Ravel, and Satie, with a few of his own compositions added in.   

800277
Here was the Labour Party reverting to its old self, a better self, yes, than the monster it became under the demonic spell of Tony Benn; here was a party responsive once more to its own people, the people it so shamefully betrayed at two successive general elections since 1979, but a party &dash. as somebody once said of the SDP &dash. `promising a better yesterday". 
Here it is still with its delegations and block votes, composite motions and reference backs of its convoluted proceduralism, its quaint forms of speech and styles of address &dash. comrades, brothers, sisters, chair. 
A sufficient moral universe it may remain for those who inhabit it, but they are a dwindling <tag "532735">band</> and for large areas of the country Labour's world is a cultural world apart.  

800278
The response was tremendous and Peel constantly repeated the sessions. 
It was on one of those occasions that the power and diversity of night time Radio One managed to lift a <tag "532736">band</> out of newspaper print and into the public's ears.  

800279
Bill played in the Katherine Dunham Revue of 1943 and at the end of that year went into the army. 
When he came out he worked briefly with Art Hodes and then led his own <tag "532736">band</> in St Louis before moving into Condon's Club in New York in December 1945. 

800280
The stupidity of the British A &and. R system made sure that talent, genuine talent, became the most unimportant factor in initial returns. 
`There is a buzz going around that I'm starting a band," quoth Morrissey and no one could blame his Mancunian counterparts for deliberately yawning at the suggestion. 
This unimposing fellow, who had failed at every stage so far, is starting a <tag "532736">band</>?   

800281
The meeting's in the big room upstairs. 
It's where the bands practise. 
I can't remember what <tag "532736">band</> Petra's in, but I seen them practise once. 

800282
(Field had once mastered a tap routine to the Youmans song, but the film company could not or would not obtain the rights.) 
In the 1930s, Sid played guitar and sang `vocal refrains" with the dance <tag "532782">bands</> of Lew Stone, Jack Jackson and Ambrose. 

800283
But a new career opened up for him. 
He had played with the Eric Robinson Orchestra at the BBC and in the marvellous <tag "532736">band</> which backed the Goon Show. 

800284
He had heard the name before, in a song recorded by Bing Crosby. 
One of the musicians who played in the <tag "532736">band</> with Buddie had once ruffled Frankie's thick black hair and called him `Smallfry" in a way that was not meant to be unkind.   

800285
Although Steven Morrissey's general depression, disgust and horror was certainly fuel for his songwriting (he wrote constantly, almost as if in anticipation of the forthcoming band), he never really thought to question why he wrote. 
`It's like saying why do you breathe?", he said. 
There is certainly no evidence that Steven Morrissey ever considered himself capable of fronting a <tag "532736">band</> in these wilderness years.   

800286
Leeds had scored twice, after 60-yard passes hit with stunning accuracy, and were full of confidence, running and variety; Leicester were too `passive and respectful", as Pleat put it. 
Under the main stand a <tag "532735">band</> of belligerents chanted for his head. 

800287
I can remember him coming home and moaning about his `blooming job" and travelling up and down on the train. 
It was 1963 and as David started his new job, `Mersey Mania" was taking its stranglehold on the charts with The Beatles, Gerry and the Pacemakers, Freddie and The Dreamers; everything with a Liverpudlian accent tasted success. 
Soon David left his job and, along with George Underwood, formed a <tag "532736">band</> called The King Bees.  

800288
The soldiers face fewer demonstrations by children. 
More often they have a real enemy to aim at: masked <tag "532735">bands</> of activists who can be shot on sight.   

800289
Julianne Regan, the group's singer said: ` He just made us feel that we wanted to do something and this is the first opportunity we have had to do it." 
Richard, who has already raised #3,000 by running Battle of the <tag "532736-p">Bands</> contests, believes that the concert will raise at least another #5,000 for leukaemia research.   

800291
Then, just as it seemed in danger of becoming stale and repetitive, it threw up De La Soul. 
Now it's the indie <tag "532736">bands</> who are stuck with endless reruns of James Brown's `Funky Drummer" breakbeat while the rappers continue to revive old musics and invent new ones.   

800293
`I wish to speak to my mother, Mrs Mole," I said. 
`Pauline," he bellowed before <tag "999998">banding</> the phone down on the hall table.   

800294
And despite one or two effective ballads, little thought has been given to the function of the musical numbers in relation to the show as a whole. 
As they cement their commitment to each other and to the pursuit of purity and free thought, Alexander Hanson, as Brooke, and his coterie launch into the anodyne Anno Domini, tuneful enough perhaps, but scarcely a song to capture the idealistic exuberance of a <tag "532735">band</> of young people determined to kick vigorously over the Victorian traces.   

800295
A CBS spokesman did not exactly say `Bollocks!" when we phoned to ask him if it was true &dash. but his denial implied that he reckoned our enquiry was testicular in the extreme. 
Meanwhile, spokesmen for The Stone Roses, including their management, denied that the band had even left Silvertone, and said that they are currently talking to a number of record companies. 
Any attempted departure from Silvertone, anyway, is likely to start court battles over the <tag "532736">band</>.   

800296
Morrissey was attempting to come to terms with the emptiness of success which, in moments of depression, was as numbing as past days of failure. 
It certainly wasn't the <tag "532736">band's</> strongest single to date and yet, in the commercial world, their weakest onslaught.   

800297
More power to them. 
Too many <tag "532736">bands</> here get it right that's what really wrong.   

800298
The band appears to have reformed as a two-piece: Jools Holland and the rest of them. 
Jools, who ploughes a parallel television career ringing the nation's hit bell, enjoyed a huge roar when he ambled on stage, a response repeated on the rare occasions he exercised the steel tendons in his wrists. 
When he let go and played boogie woogie piano as only he can, the <tag "532736">band</> dutifully followed. 

800299
They are holding a party for 60 family and friends on Saturday. 
The couple met at the Headington Conservative Club in 1927 when Clifford, now 78, was in a dance <tag "532782">band</>.   

800300
For some reason the designer decided that the most appropriate lighting scheme was to have huge, blue, illuminated, plastic condoms bursting through the ceiling and up through the floor. 
If one can restrain one's giggles, the <tag "532736">band</> will play the theme music of the Sinatra doctrine (My Way).   

800301
Local Festivals: 
Brass <tag "532744-a">band</> Festival (first weekend in July) and the intriguing Fire Brigade Festival (mid August).   

800302
Founder Mr Tutte proposed that George and Audrey Willett be made vice-presidents. 
As a treat for the younger players, a trip was arranged to see the Leyland-Daf <tag "532736-p">Band's</> concert at Oxford's Apollo Theatre.   

800303
Morrissey now moved into outspoken areas, possibly as groundwork fro the direction The Smiths were soon to follow. 
Bob Geldof, meanwhile, made a move of pure genius by onventing <tag "532736-p">Band</> Aid.   

800304
But it's unlikely that the Pain Teens will ever reign there. 
QUITE WHAT provoked head Skinster Michael Gira's hippyesque conversion over the last couple of years is, at present, still unknown. 
What is certain, however, is that around the tail end of the '80s he met fellow Skin victim Jarboe, signed their other <tag "532736">band</> Swans to a disastrous one-album major deal and cheered up.   

800305
The event has been organised by the Harwell Feast Committee and all proceeds will benefit the villagers. 
Wantage Silver <tag "532747-p">Band</> presents The Koper Ensemble Ariosos from Wichelen, Belgium on Saturday at the Civic Hall.   

800306
The Duke of Kent, Vice-Chairman of the British Overseas Trade Board, visits companies in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. 
On this day: Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope, 1497; the first coelocanth `living fossil fish" was caught off Cape Province, South Africa, 1938; Juan Carlos of Bourbon was sworn in as King of Spain, 1975. 
THE DUKE Ellington and Count Basie orchestras were the paragons of the jazz <tag "532765-a">big-band</> era, and not surprisingly some of the greatest jazz soloists came up through their ranks. 

800307
There will actually be 12 different festivals going on, including one for children. 
Community organisations on the estates are putting together projects like film and video workshops and steel <tag "532756">bands</>.   

800308
Even so, where conservative musical idioms tend to polarise critics and public, Joubert provided persuasive evidence that a composer can be direct in appeal without being banal. 
There was a deal of commitment from the performers under Jeremy Patterson, although with only 20 men against a vast <tag "532736">band</> of altos and sopranos the choral sound often lacked bite.   

800309
I'll always be wandering around the North somewhere," Morrissey told No. 1 magazine in March 1984. 
Two months prior to making this statement Morrissey had moved to London (leaving the rest of the <tag "532736">band</> a hundred and eighty miles up the motorway) to keep an eye on people.   

800310

Weavers Arms, 98 Newington Green Rd, N1 (226 6911) 8.30pm #2. 
Near Death Experience Hopefully simply a <tag "532736-a">band</> name, not a prediction.   

800312
The Eagle is the headquarters of the Bampton morris men whose exploits, under the charge of their Squire, Francis Shergold, are chronicled in a series of photographs on the wall of the bar, some dating back to the 1920s. 
Bampton's May Bank Holiday morris festival really sees the pub come into its own, with a barbecue in the yard, <tag "532736">bands</> in the bar and dancing in the street.   

800313
The Clash had a similar idea four years ago, when they set off on a `Busking Tour" in a doomed effort to revive grass-roots credibility. 
But even they stopped short of trimming their equipment needs down, as the Lizards have done, until everything fits into a small bicycle trailer. 
Everything, it must be said, comes to not much: the <tag "532736">band</> are a two-piece, requiring only a few guitars and a small home-made PA system. 

800314
And so on. 
The Chords, latest mod revivalists, are acclaimed `the best young <tag "532736">band</> in Britain" in our feature on the band.   

800315
Organiser Tina Sullivan said that all the money raised so far had been spent on instruments but it was now time to concentrate on buying uniforms. 
With this in mind they are staging a bring and buy sale on Saturday from 10am until 12 noon in St Peter's Church hall, Newlands Avenue, Didcot. 
Visitors will also be able to find out about the <tag "532736">band's</> future plans and view a display of instruments.   

800316
Bethell, of Downs House stables, Chilton, said it was a new car and he had not realised his speed. 
A band from the past resurface at Banbury United FC tomorrow night &dash. Blodwyn Pig. 
The recently reformed <tag "532736">band</>, popular in the early seventies, comprises former Jethro Tull members Mick Abrahams and Clive Bunker, with Andy Pyle and new member Gordon Murphy.   

800317
It stayed at the top of the record charts for five months and by the next year was the title of a cheap quickie movie. 
Haley and his <tag "532736">band</> rocked their way through it to fame and fortune with the bass player lying on top of his instrument straddled by the saxophone player who removed his tartan jacket to reveal his braces. 

800318
So, when they'd finished performing I've Got My Mojo Working, I pointed out to David that these people didn't really appreciate their music and David, being the sensitive soul that he is, burst into tears. 
I told him not to worry and that I was quite impressed and would be interested in managing the <tag "532736">band</>.   

800319
`I felt as though I was quite enthusiastic that night," said singer-guitarist Richard Ramage. 
`We are not the sort of <tag "532736">band</> that leaps in the air like some American rock band &dash. but we are enthusiastic. 

800320
In interviews throughout the day, he and cabinet colleagues made statements which suggested the softening-up process had begun &dash. with representatives at this week's party conference in their sights. 
Replying to common criticism that Margaret Thatcher tended to be a one-woman <tag "532814">band</>, Mr Baker said on BBC television's On the Record: `I think there will be a growing amount of Cabinet discussion.   

800321
There was At-Swim-Two-Birds, a fantastic construction about a man who is writing a novel but whose characters have revolted and are writing about him while he is asleep, which though it had tiny sales, had been praised lavishly by Beckett, Joyce and Graham Greene on publication in 1939. 
Hidden at home was the typescript of The Third Policeman, another surreal comic masterpiece, which he had pretended to lose after its rejection by Longmans. 
An Beal Bocht (later translated as The Poor Mouth), a hilarious parody of stern literature about nobility and suffering in the poverty-stricken Irish-speaking areas, had a tiny <tag "532735">band</> of aficionados who included Sean O'Casey. 

800322
Seemingly, no-one is safe from their remorseless attacks: right-on 11 year-old skatefreaks (`Rad Dude"), Ray Reardon (`Spooky Perv Happenings In The Snooker Hall"), Ozzy Osbourne (`Betty Ford's Clinic"). 
But are Lawnmower Deth a <tag "532736">band</> without pity? 

800323
No one in the world knows how near we are to being snuffed out completely." 
THE New York avant garde of the Forties, the Chicago avant garde of the Sixties, the British avant garde of the Eighties, and a local boy making good with a nod in most of these directions could be heard on one night in London last week. 
Red Rodney, Charlie Parker's most regular post-Gillespie trumpet partner and now a genial, stocky and energetic 62-year-old, was on display at Ronnie Scott's Club until Saturday and Chicago saxophonist and composer Henry Threadgill brought his <tag "532736">band</> to the Bloomsbury Theatre on Tuesday, unveiling a collection of closely written, sometimes over-refined but immaculately played works by means of a curious band featuring bass and cello, two drummers and a trombone/trumpet/saxophones front line. 

800324
Bert Bales, pianist, died 26 October San Francisco, aged 87. 
During the Forties he led his own group, and also played in the Lu Watters <tag "532736">band</>. 

800325
But the jump-suit and dishevelled locks did her few favours. 
With great generosity of spirit, Harry has included two young women in the <tag "532736">band</>.   

800326
It always threw him. 
`Hullo, darling!" she said, as she came round the kitchen door in her black trouser-suit, her black hair swept back under an Alice <tag "532736">band</>.   

800327
Mr Reid said: `A lot of effort has been put into this to provide a good procession." 
`There will be about 20 stalls in the market Square and we have two live <tag "532736">bands</> playing plus a barbeque and a refreshment stand all afternoon."  

800328
Nobody could think of any, except perhaps to wonder why the Ubumen were so reserved this evening. 
Evidently Thomas's voice was shot and they'd nearly cancelled the show, since they have an American tour scheduled for the end of this week. 
Also, they seemed burdened by Support <tag "532736-p">Band</> Syndrome, whereby the audience behave as if you don't exist. 

800329
Now the happy couple will be returning to Bicester register office tomorrow to officially tie the knot. 
After the reception, William said: `The <tag "532736">band</> was still able to play when we came out of Waverley House, but it was not as it should have been as we were not able to get officially married."   

800330
In fact Watters had been playing jazz as a teenager during the so-called Golden Era of the Twenties. 
Lu began his career as `the most promising bugler" at the St Joseph's Military Academy in Sacramento and as trumpeter in the school's brass band. 
While at high school in 1926 when he was 15 he formed his own jazz <tag "532736">band</>. 

800331
She had remembered the garden fe&circ.te and tracked down the source of the music. 
Now, there was only a complaint to be made to the authorities about brass <tag "532744">bands</> and fairground organs and the wild shriekings of uncontrollable children.   

800332
This is called `snowflake" obsidian, and is something of a  collector's item. 
In most glassy lavas, bands of devitrified glass and layers of frothy,  bubbly glass are interleaved with layers of unaltered material. 
When  this happens, one can see clearly displayed just the convulsions and  contortions the lava goes through as it flows: the <tag "533495">bands</> are tightly  folded in tortuous patterns.   

800333
I welcome this project and wish it every success." 
Meanwhile, men in impeccable dinner suits swapped business cards at a rapid rate while women sporting glamorous cocktail dresses talked among themselves. 
A regimental brass <tag "532744">band</> played very British tunes as guests enjoyed a sumptuous five-course banquet for which they paid at least #50 a head. 

800334
Outdoor types can enjoy a game of tennis, and tuition is available. 
Free activities: The brass <tag "532744">band</> gives regular concerts, there are guided walks and even occasional windsurfing regattas!   

800335
The meeting's in the big room upstairs. 
It's where the <tag "532736">bands</> practise. 

800336
Marie says it's to keep the noise in, but I don't reckon it works too well, cos you can hear them all over the house when they practise. 
It was pretty interesting watching Petra's <tag "532736-a">band</> practise.   

800337
I'm dancing and singing &dash. he's dancing and singing. 
The thing is the <tag "532736">band</> has got to be in the best spirits always which is one of the reasons David and I have been working together so well. 

800338
Vancouver's excellent flute-driven folkies Spirit Of The West are now on tour, promoting their first UK album release Save This House; go and see them at the Old White Swan, Stamford (tonight), Ipswich Golden Lion (tomorrow) and Kennington Oval (Saturday). 
Also on the album front, two bunches of Levellers; Brighton's ragged-trousered, philanthropissed troubadours have produced a really good debut with intelligent songs and the best fiddle player this side of Bobby Valentino, while a weird crew called Levellers 5, from Lancashire, give us SpringtimeBob Dylan meets Half Man Half Biscuit meets Frank Zappa. 
Even more eclectic than that, Dutch <tag "532736">band</> Trespassers W do Brecht on acid.

`Songs like `I Want You" by Elvis Costello, which just sort of goes into itself at the end. 
I wanted to make it sound as if the band had committed suicide, as if they just couldn't go on." 
Yet most <tag "532736">bands</> are happy to sound as if they just couldn't end. 

800340
So they went to Transylvania to root them out, with all the fervour of those blues fans who descended on Mississippi in the early sixties. 
They came back with music that has the universal appeal of Irish traditional song, and even echoes of Irish jig and ballads, though with a harsher edge and even more elaborate decoration. 
The <tag "532736">band</> themselves are like an east-European answer to The Chieftains, in their mixture of charm, virtuoso playing, and the apparent ability to appear absolutely anywhere.

On this day: the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden (now the Royal Opera House), was opened, 1732; William Pitt the Younger became prime minister, 1783; Delaware became the first of the United States, 1787; the Alhambra Theatre was burned down, London 1882; Gilbert and Sullivan's opera The Gondoliers was first produced, London 1889; the Abyssinians defeated the Italians at Amba Alagi, 1895; an imperial edict authorised all Chinese to cut their pigtails, 1911; David Lloyd George became prime minister of Britain, 1916; the United States declared war on Austria-Hungary, 1917; the first parliament of the Irish Free State met, electing William Thomas Cosgrave as president, 1922; the parliament of Northern Ireland voted against being included in he Irish Free State, 1922; Japanese aircraft attacked Pearl Harbor, 1941; the Ivory Coast became an independent republic, 1960; Apollo 17 was launched from Cape Kennedy, 1972. 
DESPITE his unusually long career in jazz, British listeners knew Jimmy Shirley mainly for the Blue Note records he made in 1943 and 1944 in <tag "532736">bands</> led by Edmond Hall, James P. Johnson and Sydney de Paris.   

800342
One of two things can then happen. 
One would be for there to be a revaluation of the mark, which would explicitly mean a rewriting of its Louvre <tag "532734">band</>. 

800343
The song remained alarmingly unimportant. 
`Hatful Of Hollow", despite the carefully scrubbed edges, came complete with a `sound" well within the reach of any <tag "532736">band</> &ellip. well, almost.   

800344
A new compilation has arrived to clear the windmills of our minds. 
`Stasis" is a collection of tracks recorded between 1971 and 1975, and I'm here to tell you that most of it is pretty awful stuff. 
The sleeve pictures of the <tag "532736">band</> are priceless, naturally, but forget fashion notes for a moment.

Angie Bowie: 
The <tag "532736-p">Band</> Aid example, and that entire vehicle of causing some good to be done, is an area where I'm sure he will make his influence felt.

It's a slow job. 
Big bucks means long tours, and this either breaks the US or the <tag "532736">band</>.

Since his breakthrough a couple of years back, Sheppard's eloquent playing has matured perceptibly. 
To celebrate his successes, a short tour on which Sheppard and his <tag "532736">band</> are joined by Microgroove, starts off in the city where he cut his musical teeth.   

800348
Morrissey had inspired speculation by his conspicuous non-attendance at the band's post-Albert Hall lig a couple of weeks previously. 
(For the uninitiated this is a gathering of the privileged few to down cocktails, cause gossip column `sensations" and generally be seen and pamper the stars of the show). 
But `Shakespeare's Sister" (which took its title from a Virginia Woolf essay on what would have happened if the bard had been female, a different way of looking at women although one has to search hard to find any reference to this in the actual song) was hardly the <tag "532736">band's</> most shining masterwork, merely a jumble or rock and rockabilly plummeting through 129 seconds which fail to motivate the memory cells.   

800349
Last year Mould chose to test the truth of this dictum when the trio that had been his mainstay for nine years collapsed. 
He took himself off to the Minnesota farm he had bought in October 1987 and spent a year staring into the mirror and writing songs. 
The result is a solo album entitled Workbook which finds Mould expanding on Husker Du's musical palate while retaining the <tag "532736">band's</> unflinching commitment to emotional honesty.   

800350
NEIL YOUNG Freedom (Reprise WX 257) In the year when the fortysomethings all come good again, even Neil Young gets to release his best LP in ages. 
In his case, this reversion to form follows a decade of frantic stylistic scurryings down any number of blind alleys, changing tack (and <tag "532736">band</>) from album to album; and it's been achieved by an acknowledgement of his strengths rather than the indulgence of his whims.   

800351
My silent appeals for help had been ignored by my crouching, laughing compatriots. 
A rock <tag "532736">band</> played as we ate dinner in the Shipka, people danced, there was a quarrel over a woman, a near fight.

I'd be very interested to hear what the next rumour is &ellip. but I don't really have anything to say. 
Yes, the <tag "532736">band's</> very happy &dash. we all think the next LP is the best record we've ever made."   

800353
The six largest groups, all with more than 400 branches under their control, were incurring combined losses of #11 million a month and there was no hope of an upturn. 
Several of the major buyers were even tempted to sell back the estate agencies at knock-down prices to their original owners; and with most agencies still little more than one or two person <tag "532814-x or 532735">bands</>, the large conglomerates were being run ragged by these more agile operations for what little business remained.

Yet, with Deacon Blue getting the high score covering Bacharach &and. David songs, and a lot of new bubblegum little more than MOR, `Sundrive Road" couldn't have arrived at a better time, when there must be a pay-out for mature bands making no bones about playing pop for its own sake. 
Although Swim hail from Dublin you will only be able to infer their Celtic roots &dash. they're not a band that wear their heart on their sleeve. 
Joe Reilley and Paul Holmes, the <tag "532736">band's</> songwriting partnership, tackle pop head-on, aspiring to make you feel what pure pop can: elusive warmth and some sort of prefabricated goodness.   

800357
They played in here and slagged the place off which I thought was a bit pathetic but I don't pretend that I like all their ideas. 
I mean, I don't swallow everything Morrissey says but I'll always consider him worth listening to." 
The legendary Jon the Postman, (the ultimate fan of seventies punk who achieved minor fame by clambering on to the stage and reciting `Louie Louie" at the finish of every Buzzcocks gig): `The Smiths are a great rock'n'roll <tag "532736">band</>.   

800358
Outside was blazing sunshine and inside the place was fairly dark and then the door opened at the end of the room and the sun blazed in and three people came in and one of them was very tanned, thin and brown &dash. David had just flown in from Africa. 
The rehearsals were strange because Carlos was in charge and all the time David seemed very much to be behaving like a kid, as if he was his own kid brother who got the chance to jump up and sing with the <tag "532736">band</> sometimes.   

800360
THE BIG band singers of the 1930s and 1940s, though they received a good deal of commercial encouragement, had a hard time convincing their fellow instrumentalists. 
They were dismissively labelled as `canaries" (most of them were women) by those who resented the commercial pressures on jazz improvisation that accompanied the big band boom. 
The result was that though the <tag "532736">bands</> did use a good many singers whose accomplishments didn't greatly exceed being able to pitch a note and look presentable in a party dress, the real accomplishments of many of the vocalists didn't get their due inside the business.  

800361
It may have been `Jesus On The Payroll" by Thrashing Doves or `Acid Tax" by Phuture, it didn't matter. 
Yet now we're told indie bands shouldn't be allowed to make dance records (because they don't understand it), that at the start these bands wee quite rightly isolated by house (`Here was the nation's party in full swing and they couldn't get in"). 
Sad claims, but nothing compared to an NME reviewer's view that the <tag "532736">band</> Flowered Up shouldn't be allowed to play in clubs, because black music has always been the mainstay there, and Flowered Up have their roots in rock.

A year ago, when your trousers didn't condemn you as a person, Bobby Gillespie started going to house clubs; he wore ripped jeans and a sad top, but was truly touched by what was happening around him. 
So when his band Primal Scream released `Loaded", one of the best winter dance records, everything seemed sweet. 
But if Bobby wanted to get in on it now, he'd have been turned away at the door: the elitists would have laughed at him for being in an indie <tag "532736">band</> and `Loaded" might never have been produced.   

800364
Releasing a collection of radio sessions with a few previously unavailable songs in perfect timing for Christmas does appear to be begging for critical crucifixion. 
However, due to the unusual position the <tag "532736">band</> found themselves in, I prefer to believe the second official theory. 

800365
Meanwhile, I still can't get the taste of that fish filtered coffee out of my mouth &ellip 
THE MIDDLE of the road is a dangerous place for a young pop band to pitch its tent &dash. so many that do so are run over by press disfavour and public disinterest. 
Yet, with Deacon Blue getting the high score covering Bacharach &and. David songs, and a lot of new bubblegum little more than MOR, `Sundrive Road" couldn't have arrived at a better time, when there must be a pay-out for mature <tag "532736">bands</> making no bones about playing pop for its own sake.

" Short, bitter sweet and brutally to the point. 
Limbering up for the ensuing psychological / physical endurance marathon on the groove-locked crawling king snake blues of `Lonely", from there on in there's no turning back as Rollins, Andrew, Sim Cain, and Chris Haskett seriously screw on the power, tail-shunting their hysterically intense cover of the Pink Fairies' `Do It" in the process. 
Believe it, brothers and sisters, no other <tag "532736">band</> anywhere can so consistently articular what's little short of a full-scale earthquake &dash. one that's flavoured with more than the odd hint of Isaac Hayes, James Brown, Blue Cheer, Swans and vintage Black Sabbath!

The power is often used in Northern Ireland. 
On one occasion, the RUC stopped a bus containing members of a Protestant apprentice boys <tag "532736">band</>, 30 miles from the largely Catholic town where it was their intention to march.

Now comes a brand new French pop style which takes note of such rootsy developments, but adds a more zany, adventurous and dangerous edge. 
We've had the post-punk and ska fusion of The Specials and the 2-Tone <tag "532736">bands</>, and the post-punk and Irish fusion of The Pogues.   

800369
Initially, he recorded comparatively little: an Ein Heldenleben for Deutsche Grammophon, a grand, craggy Bruckner Eighth and an exquisitely poised account of Mozart's A major Symphony, No. 29, K201 for EMI. 
Outside Germany, a wider pub ic became aware of the younger, refurbished <tag "532736">band</> when Karajan toured the nine Beethoven symphonies in 1961 before the integral recording for Deutsche Grammophon which pioneered the idea of the `subscription set" in the new stereo age.

They have become the most inaccessible <tag "532736">band</> in the music business.

At other times their self-evident frustration sets your teeth on edge. 
A floundering `Hit The North" has bassist Hanley grimacing as the subtleties are pummelled out of it, while `White Lightning" has the veins in his neck bulging as he desperately tries to inject some energy tries to inject some energy into proceedings. 
But just to prove what a bunch of contrary bastards they can still be, `Arms Control Poseur", combining a relentless bass drum with Smith's diffident sneering, soars about the me&circ.le&acute.e, shattering any doubts as to the <tag "532736">band's</> continued well-being. 

800373
Together they allowed their enthusiasm to formulate seemingly perfect reasons to be called The Smiths. 
`All other <tag "532736">bands</> at the time had fifteen syllable names," say Marr.

Radish is one of the best salad crops for the beginner, as it grows and matures very quickly, thus giving encouragement and confidence to the novice gardener. 
It is advisable to sow at frequent intervals, sowing in <tag "533495">bands</> the width of the draw hoe and scattering the seeds very thinly; they need only a shallow drill, and add a general fertiliser at the rate of a handful per square yard, raking it in.

It signified that his New Zealand ketch, Steinlager, had won the second leg, in 27 days, five hours, 34 minutes and 44 seconds, consolidating the lead he established by winning the first leg to Uruguay. 
Just 100 yards separated Smith and Switzerland's Fehlmann as, with dawn breaking, they staged a battle royal. 
To the amazement of a steadily growing <tag "532735">band</> of spectators they proceeded to engage in a spinnaker gybing duel as ocean racing turned to match racing.

Rehearsals are underway for the show at St Mary's School, Wantage, from March 28 to 31. 
Pictured above, getting into the riverboat style are, left to right, Brenda Brown, Louise Epps, producer Claudia Middlebrook, Vi Evans and Neil Fisher.

Other topics chosen by other teams included the ozone layer, 1992 and the psychological value of a cheese plant.

The forerunners of current Division One National champions Trev's Browning, Trev's Terrapins, have been winners of the Shield in the past. 
Brunswick Brothers are the favourites to take the three foot high solver shield and join an elite <tag "532735">band</> of four clubs who have won the competition three or more times since the first final in 1903. 

800381
Compare that with the figure of twenty-seven million which was the entire output of the very popular Victor Silvester and his strict-tempo ballroom orchestra in its whole career up to that time. 
Haley himself, a plumpish, thirtyish, dance <tag "532782">band</> leader with a kiss-curl plastered damply on his forehead, had spent years playing for high school hops. 

800382
The album sold by the skipful and, production faults aside, Morrissey's sentiments still made that vital connection with the thinking patterns of the nation's youth. 
Many a bedroom door was tightly shut for six weeks while the inmate consumed and (that old cliche&acute.) related to the sentiments expressed. 
One hesitates to suggest that the huge majority of Smiths converts were male (this was to change quite dramatically later) and that the <tag "532736">band</> had become a male vision, an ironic twist when considering the Morrissey hatred of gender divides.   

800384
A clear case of playing as prophets without honour in your own land or profiting with honour abroad. 
And things haven't changed: back in the 50s, it's rumoured, Walter Legge, the Philharmonia's legendary founder, used to split his players between separate planes not so much because he feared losing the orchestra but because he couldn't afford to lose the fee: they could always do Beethoven with half the <tag "532736">band</>.

They returned the favor by asking her to be their opening act when they toured during the summer of that year. 
Though various members of the <tag "532736">band</> have been rumoured to be romantically interested in the red-haired singer, Donnie denies this.

The strong man in charge of this campaign was Kevin O'Higgins, the Minister of Justice, who now gained his place in Yeats's pantheon with his 
O'Higgins, nephew of Tim Healy, the first Governor-General of the Free State, was thus a descendant of `the Bantry <tag "532735-p">Band</>" who had destroyed Parnell.

If beer is not your tipple, it is still worth the trip because there is so much going on. 
There's a huge fun fair, wonderful decorations, oompah <tag "532736">bands</> playing, whole oxen spit roasting, and generally a tremendous friendly atmosphere.

But they're working hard to make a name for themselves as serious musicians. 
To these kids, that means presenting an honest, positive, and upbeat image of themselves in both their music and their videos. 
`When we make our records, we try to be true to our music and the spirit of the <tag "532736">band</>," says Donnie.

FORMED AROUND the nucleus of Canadian techno trash terrorists Dwayne Goettel and Cevin Key of Skinny Puppy, plus Al Nelson of Flu, the Hilt line-up actually precedes Skinny Puppy by several years. 
Nelson and Key played together in punk bands in the late '70s until the latter went to Japan and was taken aback by Tokyo's nascent Technopolitan revolution, with bands like Yellow Magic Orchestra taking the spirit of Kraftwerk into the 21st century. 
Returning to Vancouver, he formed a <tag "532736">band</> called Images In Vogue, vaguely New Romantic percussors to this unit which split in 1984.

The format of her nine-piece Roots Band says a lot. 
Two guitars, bass and drums may be the classic rock-group line-up, but the more expansive setting of a horn section and a rhythm section led by a Hammond organist has a longer history, and perhaps a richer one. 
Johnny Otis, in conversation with the American writer Arnold Shaw a few years ago, traced it back to the late Forties, when the post-war economy was killing off the big dance <tag "532782">bands</> of the swing era, including Otis's own.

She said the people on the convoy were `misled, misinformed and left to go it alone in a dangerous situation". 
Mrs Jarvis said the Edinburgh-based Flanders and Scottish Alliance, which organised the convoy, sent out officials, a pipe <tag "532736">band</> and a pop group on luxury coaches and had next to no contact with the convoy itself.

This rather tenuous Morrissey connection managed to gain pockets of press coverage that would otherwise have been wasted on Bananarama or something equally appalling. 
Whatever, the seven hundred had gathered in earnest and, just prior to the <tag "532736">band's</> flamboyant saunter on to the stage, the International doors were flung open in dramatic fashion.

Last month President Roh Tae Woo paid a visit to Buckingham Palace, and one of the British popular papers heralded this event with the memorable headline: `Lock up your corgis, Ma'am". 
An angry Korean has now written to the Korea Herald saying: `Now that our President is safely back home, I am going in the ring with my gloves off to fight those ill-mannered, brash bunch in this spicy dog war, intending to inflict the darkest hour upon them since Dunkirk." 
Mr Kwan-sa You then runs through a list of the not-so-palatable habits of other nations, such as slaughtering baby seals and whales, concluding with: `How will they feel, if a <tag "532735">band</> of Koreans should treat their endeared Queen rudely by staging a quid pro quo demonstration against the brutal, bloodthirsty English sport of fox hunting when Her Majesty steps down on our soil in due time?"

I keep, apart from the fact that we've got an enormous  number of deadlines, but David keeps saying,  `we must stop",  and then people ring us up and say  `Oh, I, can I do this",  and we've, you know people say,  `Oh, well, I play the saxophone",  and then we find out that he's got a huge <tag "532736">band</> and he's  very famous, and they've just rung us up to say, you  know, can we play for you for free.

`Sail Away" was introduced as a reminder of the plight of the boat people ('The British can do the best and the worst to people'), `He Looks Like Spencer Tracy Now" (a song about an American photographer who captured the Hiroshima mushroom cloud on film) was dedicated to the CND women who said: `We're not going to have your shite on our doorstep", and, most popularly, `Wages Day" became an anthem for `the good ambulance men of London town", as we were exhorted to put a spare quid in the buckets outside the arena to give them `some kind of Christmas". 
Just when it seemed that he might raise a fist or resort to banner-waving indulgences, he de-charged the atmosphere, hamming up some frenzied rock-star spoofery, `Oh God, you're all fantastic, I can hardly control myself," as he fell offstage into the arms of a strategically-placed steward who permitted a young blonde to plant a smacker on his cheek before resurrecting him to the microphone. 
The humour didn't always fire &dash. a skit about a sad chip-eating Glaswegian being serenaded by a Salvation Army <tag "532736">band</> wouldn't have raised a guffaw on a Sunday night at an Outer Hebridean Palladium. 

800410
All have songs ranging from fast to slow, and also songs that incorporate both ends of this range. 
To me, they are highly underrated &dash. they are a band who write tuneful songs and have a very good line-up, despite what Ian Cheek thinks of `Scott Reynolds' hapless inability to sing in anything other than a monotone shout". 
I saw All in Bristol and, despite a small crowd (most of whom had come to see the support <tag "532736">bands</>) and an incompetent sound engineer, they were powerful and intense.   

800411
The era was further epitomized by the Beatles' number one hit at the start of the year, `Day Tripper", and the Rolling Stones' new album, Aftermath. 
Dylan upset his traditionalist fans by adding electronic backing for his new tour in the wake of the weird and wonderful sounds being emitted by two underground <tag "532736">bands</> called Pink Floyd and Soft Machine.

Pop Scene caught up with the group before they left. 
Although they are unhappy at the state of the rock music industry in this country, the band are anxious to make it clear that they do not intend to abandon Britain. 
Keyboard player Tony Stock said: `It seems to me you are either a struggling <tag "532736">band</> or you are playing Wembley Arena &dash. the middle ground seems to have fallen out of it."

It cost something in the region of #13m to assemble Saturday's squad, who produced nothing in the region of the kind of football that sort of money should guarantee. 
No wonder the large <tag "532735">band</> of United followers, who after all have financed this team of million-pound misfits, were singing `what a load of rubbish" some time before the end.   

800415
So there's Bruce Hornsby adding his rolling, rhythmic piano to the title track, new girls Edie Brickell and Melissa Etheridge joining in the `you can't take it with you" consumer attack of Gimme What You Got, Mike Campbell of Tom Petty's Heartbreakers adding in some chiming guitar work on The Heart Of The Matter, and even W. Axl Rose of Guns N'Roses joining the muted bluesy rock thrash I Will Not Go Quietly. 
Many of the best contemporary American <tag "532736">bands</> are sticking to the well-tested, simple formula of two guitars, bass and drums &dash. the line-up Lou Reed used so brilliantly on his New York album, and at Wembley this week.

I want this circling refluxion of our old reconditioned pleasures and our new genuine ones to continue for years, decades, until it becomes impossible to trace backward the history of any particular liking, just as it was impossible to unstir the rash dollops of red or yellow tint my mother used to add to the custom-mixed paints she got from Sears: she used old peanut butter jars as receptacles, and sat cross-legged in the side yard pouring imperceptibly different yellow-greens from one jar to another, refining the color that she wanted for the porcelain-knobbed dresser in my sister's room, though the young technician in the paint department at Sears had with apparently scientific precision injected what seemed to me a perfectly acceptable series of squirts of yellow, cyan, and magenta from the paint organ into a white base, according to the recipe in a notebook for the sample chip my mother had matched to the border of a cloth calendar. 
She was closing in now on her idea; she had long since made use of the one free stirrer that came with the can of paint, and was now, `warming" the dresser-color-to-be by dipping a pencil in a tiny can of old Rust-Oleum and holding it above the peanut butter jar so that a stream of red fell, disappearing entirely at first and pooling in an invisible bulb of unmixedness at the heart of the host hue, and then later, as the pencil's burden lightened, thinning to a stretched rubber <tag "532838">band's</> breadth frail enough to remain caught on the surface, recording in Spirograph patterns the minute trembles of her hand and the light breezes that unplumbed the paint's angle of descent.

`For their demo tape. 
For the <tag "532736">band</>."   

800419
Not surprisingly this became the least selling Smiths record of them all. 
Both <tag "532736">band</> and company quietly let the thing slip away, never to be mentioned again.   

800421
HEAVY Metal, the music we love to hate, is the subject of Penelope Spheeris's new movie, The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years. 
Chronicling the new dinosaurs of rock "n" roll, Spheeris trawls through the metal clubs of LA to meet the <tag "532736">bands</> and the brainless. 

800422
Style comes in other forms. 
The Dutch brass band of fans that accompanies the team was refused admission at the stadium in Cagliari because the instruments could, said police, have been used as weapons. 
To prove they were bona fide musicians, the <tag "532736">band</> then launched into the march from Aida and were admitted.   

800424
Mould may have added acoustic guitars and cello to his usual all-out attack but his songs are still self-lacerating calls to attention. 
Minneapolis-based Husker Du evolved from their hardcore punk beginnings into America's most respected underground <tag "532736">band</>, their commitment to sonic overload meshed with a melodic sensibility that only highlighted their disinterest in conventional pop language.   

800425
It accounts for less than eight per cent of house sales but obviously contributes to the housing market. 
An Oxford cornet player has just had a run of successes in brass <tag "532744-a">band</> competitions. 

800426
And there he stayed. 
He toured Europe and visited England with the band as recently as last May when he had not looked to be in good health. 
Ominously he was missing from the line-up when the <tag "532736">band</> played at the Nice Jazz Festival. 

800427
In the last few years, the old guard &dash. William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg and John Giorno to name three &dash. have found themselves joined by a new wave of spoken word performers. 
The surge is fronted by American post-punk writers, frustrated by the confines of the music industry and wanting to speak out. 
Ex-Dead Kennedys singer, Jello Biafra, has just released High Priest of Harmful Matter (double LP); New York post-punk doyenne Lydia Lunch follows last month's spoken word show in London with her Oral Fixation (LP); ex-Black Flag singer Henry Rollins is backed by his <tag "532736">band</> on Hard Volume (LP) and to add to last year's Sweatbox (triple LP) and Big Ugly Mouth (just the one) has reissued of Bodybag (book), just in time for his UK tour this month. 

800428
Everyone's laughing at us." 
The Cockney Rejects, peaceful chaps of the terraces, have had to cancel the rest of their tour due to the threat of violence at the gigs. 
At one show a `posse" of 400 kids were waiting outside to `get" the <tag "532736">band</> and one of their roadies was attacked by a youth with a knife.   

800429
This unsensitivity aside, though, George comes over as a pretty decent bloke who simply got fed up with his celebrity status. 
All in all, it's an interesting read until the Beatles split around p200, but it's so short on new information that you'll have to know very little about the <tag "532736">band</> to avoid a feeling of de&acute.ja vu.   

800430
Bland Maxwell Davies is not. 
His Trumpet Concerto, written for John Wallace, contains several styles of virtuosity, curling and twining, bursting with a sudden spray of notes, or galloping away like a brass <tag "532744-a">band</> showpiece. 

800431
The Quartier Latin seemed to be experiencing a severe light-bulb shortage (the stage was decorated only by a half-moon left behind by David Bowie's Serious Moonlight tour) and the closest it got to sophistication was a plastic cup with your bottle of Berliner Pils. 
Everyone sat on decommissioned church pews, or rather, after the support <tag "532736">band</> had wound up with a number called `Seven Day Soldier", everyone stood on them, stamping impatiently. 

800432
Johnny Marr blamed `record company stupidity" for the single's comparative failure. 
Arguments at Rough Trade's headquarters were the talk of the music business. 
Morrissey had inspired speculation by his conspicuous non-attendance at the <tag "532736">band's</> post-Albert Hall lig a couple of weeks previously. 

800433
Most academic economists regard this notion as so obviously true that they take it as an axiom in their research, not as a claim to be investigated. 
If communication is to improve, it will be thanks to those few academics who are both interested in the mechanics of real markets and want a scientific account of the forces that drive them. 
A leader of this <tag "532736">band</> is Mr Robert Shiller, a young professor of economics at Yale University.   

800434
As the search for a suitable guitarist proved fruitless, it appeared that The Smiths would not be carrying on as a unit. 
There was always going to be heavy legal problems surrounding the continued use of the name The Smiths anyway, and the problems in furthering the <tag "532736">band</> became unassailable.   

800435
Turning professional, he toured with Carol Lofner's band where he stayed for five years and then sailed to China as a ship's musician. 
Back in San Francisco, he worked with several groups and then formed his own 11-piece band to play at Sweet's Ballroom in Oakland from 1938 to 1943. 
When trombonist Turk Murphy first heard this <tag "532736">band</> in 1937 it consisted of a rhythm section, four brasses and three reed instruments that, as Murphy said, `never played together". 

800436
He later described the incident as the most important in his life. 
In London, Jim Hollingdale, 19, a musician with the Marquee Club resident <tag "532736">band</> Well Loaded, acknowledges his debt to Morrison and admires his ability to combine complex lyrics with good music.   

800437
There is often live music in the bars and the discos are quite lively. 
In high season the village brass <tag "532744">band</> plays regular concerts and there are waterski displays most weeks.   

800438
`We stick to tunes &dash. we are not primarily a noise band. 
I think that if we were a bunch of boys with guitars we would be very different, but I think it is very good that we have Ali (keyboards) and Trudy (guitar and vocals) in the band to stop us being too traditionally `rockist."" 
`I think it is too easy for male <tag "532736">bands</> to go off on a male ego trip." 

800439
Sorry, if it's running. 
Victor Sierra's `rubber <tag "532838">band</>" possesses a great ability to frighten the life out of a pilot flying her for the first time, by apparently stopping if and whenever the revs drop below 1800, when the most horrendous mixture-timing `flat-spot" occurs and it all goes quiet up front.   

800440
At its classical best, the line-up offers all the variety and flexibility you could want within the idiom. 
All the way through the set on Tuesday I kept thinking of the <tag "532736">bands</> who have taken this format and embellished it over the decades: the wonderful Stax house band which backed Otis Redding, James Brown's polyrhythmic adventurers, Georgie Fame's Blue Flames, Van Morrison's Moondance band, the supremely sophisticated Earth, Wind and Fire, the thunderous Washington DC `go-go" bands of the mid-Eighties, Southside Johnny's Asbury Jukes, and others without number. 

800441
The union of Marr and Quando was also seen as a peace treaty between The Smiths and The Factory organisation. 
Quando's lead singer and saxophonist, Mike Pickering, was also the official booker for <tag "532736">bands</> at the Hac&cedilla.ienda.

They jerk awake mid-service and spontaneously break into a rude jig, affording the parson a perfect opportunity to sack them and install an obedient harmonium instead. 
This was the trend up and down the country, though gallery bands survived longer in the North &dash. partly out of resilience, partly because tin-miners from the West moved north to start coal-mining, and took their music with them. 
The Taverner's CD version of God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen, shrill and rustic, was guided by the singing still heard in pubs around Sheffield, where vestiges of the gallery <tag "532736">band</> performing tradition have survived today. 

800447
Despite his youth &dash. he is in his mid-twenties &dash. Gibbons is on the way to becoming something of a Gershwin expert. 
The Threepenny Opera Suite is not quite as lighthearted as the Gershwin. 
Weill uses a jazz <tag "532736">band</> and a somewhat cynical `wrong note" jazz idiom to help underline the social criticism of Brecht's story based on the famous Beggars' Opera.

The brass section is pictured left. 
The programme of music will include items by joint wind <tag "532736">bands</> and orchestras ending with a performance of Vivaldi's Gloria sung by no less than 360 voices and accompanied by an orchestra of county peripatetic music staff.

The letters page contains a plea from R Scott of Doncaster: `I am writing to complain about the appalling lack of sexism in Sounds." 
Hopefully R Scott is one of a dying breed. 
Trendy followers of top Manchester rockers HAPPY MONDAYS were shocked yesterday when the <tag "532736">band</> &dash. famed for their lose-fitting clothing and `drop-out" attitude &dash. announced they were set to tour with '60s `straight" rocker DOONICAN. 

800450
`He was a bit older than me and he beat me up when I was in the first form," recalled the accountant. 
Nevertheless, he went on to precede Pete Best as the first drummer in the Quarrymen, the pre-Beatle <tag "532736">band</> that took its name from the school.   

800451
Morrissey was still very upset about that incident and wanted to be close to the decision makers. 
In a February issue of Record Mirror he displayed a strange coldness towards his leaving the <tag "532736">band</> behind.   

800452
The feel was `Get to Manchester and get signed" although it rarely worked that way. 
One such <tag "532736">band</>, Victim, made the break from their native Belfast and fell into a false sense of security by capturing a small time record contract with Tony Davidons' T.J.M. Label.   

800453
Rigorous dressing down, rather than up, is the prevailing chic at the two best live music venues in the city: The Metropol and the Quartier Latin. 
The Metropol, occupying a fine art deco theatre, has two halls: the Loft upstairs for gentle Folk and the main downstairs hall playing host to visiting <tag "532736">bands</> like Texas.   

800454
Tucked in the schedule between the Mass Choir and the group Urban Sax is the French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac who will appear live, on a huge screen, to hand over the `Cultural Capital of Europe" status from Paris to Glasgow. 
Robbie Coltrane, the Scots comedian, has three short minutes to amuse the audience before the bells strike midnight and the fireworks in the city's surrounding parks are launched, and the Water Boys, a <tag "532736">band</> who plug the Celtic connection, are rumoured to be appearing.   

800456
Choose loose-fitting clothes in natural fibres such as lightweight wool, worsted, silk or cotton. 
Avoid plastic belts as these will quickly produce a hot, sticky wet <tag "533495">band</> around the waist &dash. go for leather ones instead. 

800457
This was one specimen, prefiguring the group's later swing into neat country. 
Do You Know How It Feels To Be Lonesome? &dash. International Submarine <tag "532736-p">Band</> (Safe At Home, LHI 1968, Statik reissue 1985) Gram Parsons" original band recorded Safe At Home, arguably the first-ever country rock album, in November and December 1967. 

800459
The result, on songs like Heartbreak A Stranger, Poison Years and Lonely Afternoon, is a remarkable exercise in rousing and chilling angst. 
With luck, he'll be playing here in the autumn. 
The second gloomily dangerous, if not so personal, set of the week comes from Material, that occasional experimental <tag "532736">band</> put together by producer Bill Laswell, known for his work with PIL, Jagger, Afrika Bambaataa, and Jamaican and African performers.   

800460
It's about time groups felt more about the music than the money." 
The initial contract with Rough Trade was a simple singles deal. 
The company couldn't foresee great success or they would have tied up the <tag "532736">band</> for years by way of contract options. 

800461
Lucky Jim adored revivalist jazz (like his creator) and so did Jimmy Porter, who played the trumpet to ease his frustrations and declared that he didn't think he could love anyone who didn't love jazz. 
In their Fair Isle knitted sweaters and their duffel coats, with submissive girls in tow, heavy pipes clamped in jaw and the air of thoughtful acolytes observing time-honoured rites, they would stand in groups in smoky clubs living a new version of the Vie de Bohe&grave.me. 
Their first hero, Humphrey Lyttleton, with his club at 100 Oxford Street, was always pointed out to be an Old Etonian and a Guardsman (which was socially comforting but far from typical) and brought in each of his <tag "532736">band's</> numbers with four romantic thumps of his foot. 

800462
Who can say? 
The rest of the <tag "532736">band</> were not available for comment, but all the record companies we spoke to assured us that they had enough new material from Various to see us well into the next century.   

800464
In retrospect, what with `Anthrax", the ultimate anti-love song, and `At Home He's A Tourist" (GO4's sole brush with the charts), `Entertainment" was only matched in 1979 by another debut, Joy Division's `Unknown Pleasures". 
The Gang Of Four never really regained the heights of that first album, troubled by the inherent contradictions of their own position, sapped by the loss of Allen and Burnham on bass and drums and unhealthily obsessed with the heart of the great beast itself, the USA. 
Too clever by half, they could encapsulate in a song-title what most <tag "532736">bands</> could never express in a career &dash. `We Live As We Dream, Alone", `Capital (It Fails Us Now)" and `To Hell With Poverty" with its neat rejoinder.

If David gives them a cue, they don't take a cue from David, {typo bad="thsy",good="they"} take the cue from me. 
If David cues me and I don't cue the <tag "532736">band</>, then the band doesn't hit and then David will look at me and say, `Carlos, what are you doing?" 

800466
It might be a different medium, but Mamet is still obsessed by the niggling little things in life `You know, the basic themes, murder, lust, marriage, death; the usual little things &ellip. the primitiveness of mankind, having to hunt and be hunted." 
Mamet also sings on the <tag "532736">band's</> forthcoming album, Down From Above, an accomplished mix of high-spirted folk conjuring up images of a designer Fairport Convention, laid-back swoony jazz and breezy pop. 

800467
Since then, it seems like there hasn't been a war anywhere in the world. 
Or, at least, that's the way the music scene would have it, with the exception of some of the more sussed and radical punk <tag "532736">bands</>.   

800468
The discarded skins were drawn to other bands, such as Screwdriver, Cockney Rejects, Angelic Upstarts, Cocksparr and Bad Manners. 
These bands would either play their sets regardless of fights, or, in the case of Fat Man Doug Trendle &dash. the front man of Bad Manners &dash. would wade in and sort out the rucks himself. 
Gary Bushell of Sounds music paper constantly reviewed <tag "532736">bands</> of the Sham 69 mould.

Choose underwear that clearly distinguishes the various holes. 
A bow at the neck of a vest, for example, marks it out from the arm holes; a different-coloured waist <tag "533508">band</> indicates that it's the `bigger" hole in pants. 

800470
On this day: Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope, 1497; the first coelocanth `living fossil fish" was caught off Cape Province, South Africa, 1938; Juan Carlos of Bourbon was sworn in as King of Spain, 1975. 
THE DUKE Ellington and Count Basie orchestras were the paragons of the jazz big-band era, and not surprisingly some of the greatest jazz soloists came up through their ranks. 
At first it appears odd that while Ellington, whose <tag "532736">band</> was consistently the most interesting and productive in history, produced very great soloists, there was only a handful of them.

`I was totally dissatisified.

Dave McCullouch: `I remember once, though, when Sounds were searching for an interview and I happened to know that the whole thing was a set-up. 
I knew it was a deliberate attempt from the word go to bring the band down. 
I rang the <tag "532736">band's</> manager and told him so. 

800475
By now, however, the issue had reached the centre of the political stage. 
The Home Secretary, Mr Hurd, described the convoy as `a <tag "532735">band</> of medieval brigands who have no respect for law and order and the rights of others".  

800476
Stravinsky, as it happens, was also godfather to the programme offered earlier in the week by the Dutch mini-orchestra De Volharding (Perseverance). 
An ensemble of flute, horn, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and double bass / guitar already suggests a <tag "532765-a">big-band</> sound, and punchy syncopated riffs were certainly much in evidence. 

800477
Even now, as I type in retrospect, `Strangeways, Here We Come" plays on the hi-fi, filling the room with Morrissey's unbecoming bitterness. 
Ironically, `Strangeways, Here We Come" was the first truly depressing record the <tag "532736">band</> ever made.   

800478
His tale The Absent-Mindedness of the Village Choir relates how one Christmas the choir dozed off, having been out carousing too late the night before.

He expressed its diminution eloquently in an examination of the changes in the station-master's uniform: 
` My first uniform, issued to me at Kirk Smeaton in 1943, had a single-breasted jacket, of close texture, navy blue serge and a hard-top cap of the same material, with the words `Station Master", woven in gold silk, on the <tag "532732">band</>.

First seen alongside Neneh Cherry, singing and standing on her head with the early-Eighties cult dance <tag "532782">band</> Rip Rig And Panic, Andrea Oliver has since sung with a variety of outfits and, in between organising and cooking for a weekly night at West London's Globe club, has recently joined forces with Malcolm Joseph (previously with soul band Seventh Heaven) to form new band, Her.

They call themselves fireball swingers and every New Year's Eve at midnight they can be seen in action along the streets of Stonehaven as part of an ancient pagan Fireball Festival. 
As 12 o'clock chimes, a pipe <tag "532736">band</> strikes up and the procession emerges from a side street swinging their balls overhead with gusto, like a team of Olympic hammer throwers with fiery meteors on the ends of their wires. 

800482
The final bars of `She Loves You" seem refined enough to offer a prototype. 
At the end, the <tag "532736">band</> clatters for the last time round the four chord circuit which forms the chorus, but this time kicking the words aside for a string of `Yeah's", before landing on that final huge harmony &dash. a stressed sixth, a mildly dissonant plagal cadence indeed, although, for all Lennon and McCartney cared, plagal cadence could as well have been some kind of gum disease.   

800483
`Mona" ensures that if you didn't want to strangle Craig McLachlan before, then you will now, whilst `Diddley Daddy", the kooky 12-bar of `Little Girl" and the railroad shuffle `Who Do You Love" are fundamental lessons from the face that launched a thousand riffs. 
In addition, we're treated to Diddley's special line in leg thrusts and his <tag "532736">band's</> synchronised ministry of funny walks, plus an exclusive interview that drifts between songs, where he explains how he always wanted to be a drummer.

The Bucks &and. Oxon Division 1 side will now meet holders Oxford in the final on the same ground next Tuesday. 
OXFORD-BASED music newspaper Gig is compiling a national band register to help groups get noticed outside their home town.

It was kicks and steps of a different nature that helped Harwell Wado Ryu Karate Club become top fund-raisers for Karate Aid. 
Feeling sponsored Karate Kicks would not have a high enough profile to raise cash to help the Voluntary Service Overseas, the club decided to hold a Sixties music night with a live <tag "532736">band</> and disco at their practice place of the AERE Social Club at Harwell.

The home-grown pop culture of the land of Johnny Hallyday may have been despised throughout the rock era, but France suddenly seems more interesting than Britain.

No, the explanation had to be that smiles became audible only at bedtime because toothpaste altered the chemical characteristics of one's saliva in a way that encouraged an unusually loud, sticky effervescence along the gum line. 
And think &dash. this smile sound was just one of many mouth sounds the Bug was going to notice and master in time! 
Speech was one, of course &dash. but also the loud woodblock tock we learned in second grade, made by cupping the tongue muscle under the roof of the mouth like a chiton and pulling it down while holding the lips in an amplifying O; or the interesting ducklike squirts you could make by enclosing two pillows of air high in the cheeks, just below the cheekbones, and then forcing these reserves to surge forward into the nameless tissues above the front teeth; or the plinks and squeaks of a rubber band stretched tightly through the lower dentition and plucked by the tongue until the cheddar-cheese pain of the rubber <tag "532838">band's</> edge against your gums made your eyes water and you pulled the loop free and again stretched it over the porcelain knobs of your dresser and let the spit fling itself heedlessly off in vibration; or the little kissy noise you could make by sucking the air from the blue cap of a Bic pen and letting it seal itself against your tongue and after you'd waggled it thoughtfully for a while pulling it free; or the much more substantial steel-drum effect you got by plucking your tongue free of the vacuum it had effortfully hauled from a soft-drink bottle before the gas escaping from the remaining soda negated your work;

Comfortable, colourful and cluttered, everything in the house was used and enjoyed by the Berkeleys, their family and friends.

It had enough of a balance between nice-edge extemporisation and tightly synchronised melodic complexity to sound considered, audacious and utterly contemporary. 
This wasn't always the case with Henry Threadgill's <tag "532736">band</>, which proceeded in a more rarefied and deliberate way, at times close to modern conservatoire music, tiptoeing through delicate dissonance.

Mr Petrakov is one of the <tag "532735">band</> of influential economists who have made the mental leap to the market (`We need a normal, civilised market," he says), and have been saying with growing urgency that Mr Gorbachev must join them, and bring the country with him.

The truth, however, varied immensely depending on which source they approached. 
Although it seems pointless to reiterate the immense journalistic gaffs that screamed from most music papers (Smiths tour dates etc) it was their beloved NME who broke the official story first. 
It seemed that Johnny Marr had left the group and a statement issued on behalf of the <tag "532736">band</> ran thus: `The Smiths announce that Johnny Marr has left the group.

Areas of critical population density continue to co-exist with areas which are relatively under-populated. 
In a wide <tag "533495">band</> of west Africa, from Dakar to Kano including the `sahelian" and `sudanian" zones, the total population in 1980 was about 30 million at an average of 17 people per square kilometre.

Transmitted at peak time Saturday evening, it presented The Smiths in a state of musical diasarray. 
The sound was abysmal and the songs became submerged as the television company lost the age old battle to capture the live atmosphere. 
This said, the gig did finish with a mass stage invasion, another example of the <tag "532736">band</> gathering an intensely fanatical following.

Paramount, which is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, has issued proceedings against John Ferriday, its former chairman, and companies associated with him over payments totalling #9m. 
IVERNIA WEST, the Irish mineral explorer listed on the Third Market, has discovered deposits of vanadium and titanium in its Australian mines as much as five times as large as the group's existing proven deposits. 
Earlier this year the group commissioned a report from the international mining consultants Mackay Schnellmann, which confirmed a deposit of 15 million tonnes of vanadium in a <tag "533495">band</> between three and five metres thick.

Glitterhouse are getting firmly back on the boil with the latest from BITCH MAGNET, who appear to have finally untangled themselves from the What Goes On fiasco. 
They've got a new LP, out soon titled `Ben Hur", SWALLOW have a new LP, `Sourpuss", ready, and the ex-Chrome man HELIOS CREED has his `Boxing The Clown", LP set to go. 
The latest from Aussie tats MR FLOPPY, whose single, `100,000 Morrisseys" has taken everyone by surprise (not least the <tag "532736">band</> who split up soon after its release), is that they've decided to re-form The band, who described The Stone Roses as, `A bunch of Pommie scum who can't play and flounce around in flares", will celebrate with a new EP, tentatively entitled `Tubular Bells".   

800512
David Edgar identifies two rather different responses to the realisation that Thatcherism was not just a temporary aberration. 
`One was that what art should be doing was to re-assert the old certainties and express and underline old `Her speech to the Church of Scotland seems to me like someone who knows they don't have a sense of humour, so feels they've got to keep making jokes"

Nevertheless, the chance to perform before large Smiths crowds was an exciting opportunity for Easterhouse and they set about rehearsing in earnest. 
But as The Smiths were advised to sever all contacts with Rough Trade, they decided to drop Easterhouse from the tour. 
The problem was that nobody from The Smiths camp was prepared to actually inform the <tag "532736">band</> of this decision, and it was left to Easterhouse manager John Barrett to discover the sad truth almost by accident.   

800515
That's the better, which is to say bearable stuff, a paltry third of the album. 
The rest is just dull: New Order offer a live version of `Sister Ray" which bears scant relation to anything in the Velvet Underground songbook, even scorning the use of the original lyrics; the hardcore guitar blitzkriegs, never the strongest or most original tracks, fall this time to Live Skull, the Henry Rollins <tag "532736-p">Band</>, feminist speedcore outfit PMS, and Giorno's Band; and performance artist Karen Finley &dash. known colloquially as `Yams Up The Bum" Finley, after the alleged `highlight" of her act &dash. continues to foist her sad psycho-sexual sickness off on us in the guise of art with a (presumably stream-of-consciousness) rant entitled `Party Animal".

However, it was easy to see where the confusion lay, for Gannon was also a member of The Cradle. 
On August 8 Johnny Marr, who wasn't consulted about the above communication, issued this reply to the NME: `There is nothing approaching acrimony between myself and the other members of the <tag "532736">band</>.   

800518
This was the trend up and down the country, though gallery bands survived longer in the North &dash. partly out of resilience, partly because tin-miners from the West moved north to start coal-mining, and took their music with them. 
The Taverner's CD version of God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen, shrill and rustic, was guided by the singing still heard in pubs around Sheffield, where vestiges of the gallery band performing tradition have survived today. 
With these <tag "532736">bands</> out of the way, the Church was keen to clean up its music-making and excise all coarse elements.

Greenmere Primary School, Didcot, annual fete raised more than #1,000, part of which will be used towards the school swimming pool heating bill.

The venue is transformed with lights and effects, the stage is shared by DJs Sticker and Mixmaster Morris, by rappers, MCs and live keyboards in a seamless blend of records, tapes, samples and live performance. 
A Shamen show is designed so you don't just stand and stare at the <tag "532736">band</>: and though the live act might be the heart of the show, the spectacle of Colin (cropped Aberdeen curls, Trotsky shades), and Will (shoulder length braided locks, shabby green fatigues) is only part of an evening of light, music and effects that now involves around ten people.   

800521
Instead, they focus on the realities of choosing to be a concert composer and producing music that takes decades to return the investment on time spent. 
`What people don't realise is how labour-intensive the whole of new music is," says Sally Groves, of the music publishers Schott.

Fittingly enough, `Mothra", named for Godzilla's arch enemy, is a more aggressive, marching along forthrightly with funny lyrics to relieve the vaguely martial feel. 
13 Engines will recall some of early '80s British <tag "532736">bands</> like Echo and the Bunnymen and The Teardrop Explodes, which is no bad thing, but their colonial roots make their sound inescapably one of the New World.

The afternoon also included a table top sale and refreshments to raise money for school funds. 
Charity fund-raisers in Abingdon enlisted the support of one of band music's most famous names on Saturday to help them promote a forthcoming special concert. 
John Miller of the Herb Miller Orchestra, and nephew of the legendary American bandleader Glenn Miller braved heavy showers in the town's Market Place to help publicise a Big <tag "532765-a">Band</> Evening at the nearby Abbey Hall in May.   

800530
His `Di Provenza" was exquisitely phrased but only served to highlight further a paucity of acting skills. 
In fact the whole evening contained barely a gesture towards characterisation, so that the most vividly registered presence came from a well-lit fire-exit sign beaming out backstage. 
Down in the pit, the Radio Telefis Eireann Concert Orchestra made up for any blandness above by sounding like an over-excited school <tag "532736">band</> &dash. offering enthusiasm as a substitute for discipline.

The Town &and. Country Club was heaving with beautiful people, B-Boys (weighed down by baseball caps, ref's whistles and maps of Africa) and Patsy Kensit. 
They danced cheerfully under a haze of substance smoke and the dozens of gaudy banners with which the <tag "532736">band's</> Don Letts had decorated the place (presumably to give the self-confessedly non-musical video maker something to do).   

800532
Even Rough Trade itself, as with all other successful indies, has been effectively integrated into the fabric of the bulk industry. 
What The Smiths have gained, by remaining with Rough Trade, has been a far greater artistic control. 
Morrissey has been able to design all the record covers and, with the possible exception of `This Charming Man New York", the <tag "532736">band</> have remained as decision makers in regard to single releases, a measure of control practically unheard of in larger companies.

As I recrossed into Djibouti, villagers sympathetic to the SNM, or just wanting money, hid me from the patrols. 
In one village, suddenly raided by the army at 2am, villagers made me lie on the ground and threw a blanket over me, telling the soldiers I was an old woman, too sick to move. 
The SNM is a ragged <tag "532735">band</> of fighters with little political ideology beyond the expulsion of President Barre's forces from northern Somalia and the overthrow of his 20-year-old government.

Before her appearance she sat by the edge of the stage completely terrified.

His romantic notions of Oscar Wilde are fully acted out while he stays in this condition. 
It's not merely a false stance though: the only person who knows the real Morrissey, his mother, has proved this on many occasions by telephoning Rough Trade's office to complain about their handling of her delicate son.

Baring their navels in traditional harem style, they fluttered their hips and rolled their torsos in a dance which for decades has stood for female voluptuousness and oriental mystique.

Happy because he had spectacularly proved a point; angry because it hinted at what might have been if the selectors had been more liberal-minded. 
Harris had a code of conduct warning for saying `that's rubbish" to the referee in the first game, broke the strings in his racket in the second, and was looking short on stamina even when making a manful effort to come back in the third.

The incidence of accents and rests, permuted through a regular space-time grid, becomes rhythmic in itself as it modifies, defines and enriches the grouping procedure. 
For example, a traditional American jazz <tag "532736">band</> was subdivided into a front line (melodic) section, usually led by trumpet, and rhythm section, usually based on drums.

Care is taken to overlap generously the adjacent sections of dpc which are wedged in place with pieces of slate, and that part of the slot not filled by the impervious material is filled with 1:3 cement/sand dry-pack mortar. 
Where it is not practical to make the cut below the internal ground-floor level, the shallow strip of internal wallface left below the dpc and above the floor surface should be treated with at least two coats of bituminous paint to resist dampness, and any related timber skirtings should be replaces with more durable trim such as profiled quarry tiles which do not require fixings that could penetrate the wall sealant. 
The specialist contractors who install such damp-proof courses normally insist that any adjacent plasterwork which may have been affected by dampness is hacked off the masonry and the wholesale removal of a continuous 1m (3ft) deep <tag "533495">band</> of plaster from the foot of the affected wall is standard procedure. 

800548
Between big infrequent bites of his sandwich he showed me how to count off sets of trembling isometric exercises to the music: since he never brought a glass of water or Tang to help wash things down in an emergency, I would worry, when the throat-constricting emotion of an especially beautiful stretto combined with the exertion of the isometrics made him take deep breaths through his nose as he chewed, that he was going to choke; but he waved away my concern. 
Sometimes when he finished the sandwich he would demonstrate how to handstand to Stravinsky: at sixteen he had been able to hold himself suspended through the whole last side of the Pierre Monteux 75-rpm recording of the Rite, collapsing immediately after the last tutti crunch. 
Now, after I lowered the needle at the beginning of the tumultuously iridescent <tag "532736">band</> of side 2 (of the LA Philharmonic's rendition) that was equivalent to that last Monteux 78, he took off his glasses and assumed a sprinter's crouch amid the album covers and back issues of Stereo Review, and at the orchestra's panicky signal he kicked his legs up effortlessly, one first, the other slowly following, making a single grunt more to articulate the moment he achieved poise than to relieve any Muscular strain.

His contribution to the literature, both choral and instrumental, of the Salvation Army is vast.

Soon after the Second World War, in which he worked with ENSA (or `Every-Night-Something-Awful", as he called it), he came to work for the music publishing firm of R.

`It really makes me angry that the church has to fill the gap left by the governemnt and the local authority." 
THE BIG band singers of the 1930s and 1940s, though they received a good deal of commercial encouragement, had a hard time convincing their fellow instrumentalists. 
They were dismissively labelled as `canaries" (most of them were women) by those who resented the commercial pressures on jazz improvisation that accompanied the big <tag "532765-a">band</> boom. 

800557
He said he had not decided whether a Labour government would seek to enter sterling with a wide residual margin for fluctuation or, as support for monetary union would imply, inside a stricter and more narrow margin. 
But he said Labour was `aware of the contradictions as between going for the flexibility of a wider <tag "532734">band</> as opposed to the danger of a lower level of stability".   

800558
The arrangements, too, settled for the sweetly seductive rather than the outright and punchy.

The programmes served up to catch their interest are often disjointed with too much attention to form and not enough to content &dash. with too much dwelling in the past thrown in.

This wasn't always the case with Henry Threadgill's band, which proceeded in a more rarefied and deliberate way, at times close to modern conservatoire music, tiptoeing through delicate dissonance. 
Fred Hopkins's bass playing, however, continued to demonstrate that he remains one of the greatest practitioners of his instrument in the world, his playing a blend of secure, rock-like accompaniment and joyous, singing eloquence. 
At Ronnie Scott's, Red Rodney's <tag "532736">band</> was surprisingly crisp and forthright-surprisingly because he might have been expected to coast on his legendary status in bebop and has instead associated himself with younger musicians who play originals derived from bop, funk, Blakey-like soul jazz and Coltrane-inspired almost-free music.

800582
But, for the benefit of those who haven't noticed, we're right on the verge of a war. 
Think about that for a moment, cost it's more than just a word, it's potentially the mass genocide of innocent young people on both sides of the divide by the combined efforts of those who consider themselves fit to make such decisions for us, and about us. 
When Vietnam got nasty, many <tag "532736">bands</> were finally forced out of their apathy as it became apparent that things like conscription were bringing matters pretty close to home.

A senior operator will now earn about #26 less each week. 
But the RAF emphasises it anticipates increases in pay which will mean they will be slightly better off, even though they are moving back a <tag "532734">band</>.

In fairness, though, this was not an ideal pitch for quick scoring, slow and low, ideal conditions only for illustrating just how stereotyped one-day cricket can be. 
Medium pace, just short of a length, nudge, nick, scamper, wide, leg bye, and please don't wake me up until the last 10 overs. 
The ground was about a quarter full, but take away the police, the <tag "532736">band</>, the free-admission schoolchildren, and the sponsor's guests and dignitaries, and the actual paying spectators could all have been driven home in the motorised drinks cart.

Hampton has always been a deeply rhythmical player: so much so that his big bands have been criticised for espousing rhythm-and-blues, even though they included such great names as Clifford Brown, Charlie Mingus and Quincy Jones. 
Benny Goodman's big band became famous as epitomising the `swing" of the thirties. 
James Lincoln Collier tries to analyse this `swing" but fails because he patently doesn't understand how a <tag "532736">band</> actually works together.   

800587
The magic had certainly worked for her. 
In 1985 there was a double objective for a rally I did with Ernie Guy for the American Bar Association in the Royal Albert Hall. 
Although it was a major political speech by the Prime Minister, it was quite appropriate to have a military <tag "532736">band</> and flags and a bit of excitement.   

800588
When Dermo says `Let's get foonky woonky" in his Mancunian draw, it's as far from a fitting description of their music as one could imagine. 
Funky is not a word that was ever used to describe Joy Davidson or the Buzzcocks or any other of the straightforward guitar <tag "532736">bands</> Northside best resemble.

He started violently as he saw her, knocked over a glass of Texas champagne as he tried to stand up, then eased back down as she put a gentling hand on his shoulder saying, `Howdy, Marshal, I'm Ulyssa Effing, Miss Cajun Country Cookin", here to serve you." 
Just then, if the <tag "532736">band</> had played the national anthem he could not have stood up without adjusting his clothing.

Morrissey prepared to join the hardliners. 
Such a call to arms was, in fact, a necessity for a <tag "532736">band</> in their career situation.

This one, like all the others, shows that Ray has kept his eyes open. 
There's an ecological number sung in typically spacey fashion `The world's spinning round, like a looney balloon"; there's an anti-Thatcher song summarising the Prime Minister's lack of sensitivity in the one charge that she doesn't like rock n roll; and, proving that they are probably the only pop <tag "532736">band</> ready for the single European market, there is an EC tribute: `Down All The Days (to 1992)".

The afternoon also included a table top sale and refreshments to raise money for school funds.

They arrived a good hour before most of the Californian sun-kissed audience and looked like a pale gang of spotty oik kids playing their hearts out. 
Tim resembled the chimp son of Mick Jagger, playing the spoilt brat to the usual hilt &dash. flapping those pop star lips, dragging on a cig, spazz dancin' and splitting the stage set to `let the crowd check the <tag "532736">band</> out &ellip

Unfortunately their dreams faded and died soon after under a cloud of seemingly endless gig violence &dash. not helped by their own rallying call of `Are You Ready to Ruck?" 
Perhaps it was the shock, but the <tag "532736">band</> turned heavy metal not long after.

Police said 16 were arrested in the disturbances. 
Bilbao, the largest city in the northern region, was shut down by a general strike as Basques queued for hours outside the town hall to view the coffin of Josu Muguruza, a parliamentarian of Herri Batasuna, a separatist party linked to the ETA terrorist <tag "532735">band</>.   

800603
Briefly, the book describes the six months he spent with a little-known South African Police counter-terrorist unit named Koevoet (`crowbar"). 
The unit operated very effectively during the 1980s on the Namibia/Angola border against infiltrating <tag "532735">bands</> of SWAPO guerillas who were attempting to destabilise the country by ambush and assassination.

Rock `n" rail Some months before the troubles developed in East Germany, one of the world's more arcane organisations, the Ireland-German Democratic Friendship Society, announced plans to celebrate in Dublin the 40th birthday of their comrades' dictatorship in the East. 
A couple of <tag "532736">bands</> were hired several months ago to jolly up the celebrations, whose main participants appeared to be trade unionists who had been on free holidays to one of the last proletarian paradises. 

800607
Of the two, I'd go for the Polydor collection, partly because it serves as a decent sampler of a wider range of Brazilian talent, like Caetano Veloso and Luiz Caldas, although dance parties are probably better served by the CBS LP's flow of smooth Miami Sound-alikes. 
WITH THE recent commercial success of bands like The Stone Roses and Happy Mondays, you could be forgiven for thinking that British pop had entered its first new phase since the `pure pop" explosion of 1982 (which saw the emergence of acts like the Human League, Altered Images and Haircut 100). 
One thing these new <tag "532736">bands</> have in common, and which might constitute a reason for their success, is that they have both been afforded extensive coverage in the rock weeklies &dash. New Musical Express, Melody Maker, and Sounds.

The example of the police radios shows the relative permanence of being allocated a piece of spectrum &dash. radios and other broadcasting equipment, whether for entertainment or communication, are designed to sort out what it wants to pick up from the rest of the signal. 
To perform well it has to be tightly targeted to cope with quite a narrow <tag "532745">band</> of frequencies.

In general  the obsidian forms only on the outer skin of the lava, which is rapidly  chilled, while the central parts of the flow, which remain hot for a  long while, consist of rhyolite. 
Rhyolites are pale grey or buff-coloured rocks with a micro-crystalline  structure and a rather distinctive sugary texture or `feel" &dash. like  obsidian, they usually have a well-developed <tag "533495-n">banding</> running through  them, which shows up the flow folds in the lava plainly.

I wonder why? 
The musical equivalent of a duvet, The Moody Blues hailed from roughly the same era as Cat, and probably appealed to the same audience, which seemed to consist for the most part of bank clerk types going wild on the weekend, replacing their ties with neatly-pressed `hippy-style" neckerchiefs. 
Suffice to say that their song `I'm Just A Singer In A Rock'n'Roll <tag "532736-p">Band</>" involves a matter of some dispute; any band that includes a flautist having little or nothing to do with rock'n'roll.   

800614
They said the organisation left the volunteers in danger of not getting the supplies through. 
And they criticised organisers using two luxury coaches complete with pipe <tag "532736">band</> and pop group who sped on ahead without helping the 20-lorry convoy.

I've made a note of a potting of that briefing paper to you. 
I personally see this is as one of my major objectives over the next year or so, and in a sense it makes me trebly grateful to be here today, because I hope some of the contacts I might make today will enable me to work alongside you in what might be called even local Berkshire <tag "532736">band</>, and to try and get more a multiplicity of views from different organisations channelled through our own value objectives.

She was pinging. 
He could hear her voice rising and falling to a tune called `Sunny Side of the Street". 
It was Buddie's signature tune, the one his <tag "532736">band</> always played at the start of every session.   

800617
Ivor Bolton's conducting was exemplary: clear, brisk, no-nonsense. 
His sixteen-voice choir was admirably articulate, and the <tag "532736">band</> thoroughly reliable, while Lorna Anderson's rich soprano voice carried much of the solo work in persuasive manner.

He emerges as a man with a big heart and a clever mind who did the best he could in difficult circumstances.

For many years he made rubber ones for my father's liberty bodices and, so I was told, brass fly buttons for The Brigade of Guards. 
The two Broomheads wore their homburgs even on Open Day, when they took part in the Fathers' and Sons' Wheelbarrow Race. 
In my first year Tonto's mother and sister, ending months of quiet speculation, appeared in crimson felt with a pearl-buttoned <tag "532732 or 532733">band</>, a style recognisably descended from the homburg. 

800620
Major-General Dan Shomron, the Israeli chief of staff, claimed that the operation's aim `was to kill civilians in the most populated areas of Israel." 
The Palestinians had maps and photographs of civilian locations in Tel Aviv and elsewhere. 
The PLF belongs not to the Syrian-backed `rejectionist camp" or to the unlovely <tag "532735">band</> of `abus" identified with hardline terrorism, but to Mr Arafat's own organisation.   

800621
They identify a failure to concentrate on taking a large market share for one product; in contrast they describe a preference for entering a new market before the full potential of the current one is reached. 
Of course, there is some justification for this: competition is intense and the Nigerian public's purchasing power low, and so returns may be higher from launching a new product in a different market. 
A technical explanation of this kind however does not account for the continuing <tag "532814-a">one-man-band</> nature of many such businesses, which prevents growth for organizational as well as market reasons.   

800622
Richter Scale pictured here (clockwise Nick Kenny, Simon Kenny, Richard Curtis and Adam Newman) have already been introduced to ten major record companies &dash. and most of them will be out to catch their first sight of the dynamic quartet at a series of special showcases in London this week.

Vandals smashed windows in the sports pavillion and a cub hut at Blewbury, causing #2,000 damage.

`Not satisfied with writing lyrics describing dances already established," sighed Oscar Hammerstein II, with the bemusement of one who never had to descend to such hack work, `lyric-writers set to work creating dances, giving them names and hoping that the public would follow them." 
Berlin proved particularly adept at this: `Let me take you by the hand Over to the jungle <tag "532736">band</> If you're too old for dancing, Get yourself a monkey gland And then let's go, my little dearie, There's the Darwin theory Telling me and you To do The Monkey Doodle-Doo."

`I think it is too easy for male bands to go off on a male ego trip." 
But the Anyways are full of admiration for the likes of Ride, who have leap-frogged over them in the race for a record deal. 
They hope the success of the Oxfordshire band, who topped the independent charts with their first EP, will attract record labels to take a closer look at other <tag "532736">bands</> in the area.

800629
Hardly a welcome comment on the mentality of this nation's youth who, no doubt, understood Morrissey's ambiguous lyrics rather better than the tabloids. 
It was a return to form for The Smiths as a single <tag "532736">band</>, especially when the extra track on the 12 inch, `Half A Person", was taken into account.   

800630
Not so. 
The Smiths will never be a <tag "532736">band</> locked into the mechanisms of party politics, but if The Smiths are about life then they are about politics.   

800631
In some ways, this was so. 
His loyalty to Berlin supports it and Karajan was still recording Bach with a big <tag "532765">band</> long after it had gone out of fashion elsewhere.

Tara, with his lumberjack shirt and messy hair than hangs irritatingly over his right eye; Paul with his pudding bowl cut and lightly flared jeans (their sole acknowledgement of prevailing fashion trends) and Phil with his goofy grin and ramshackle cut. 
Together they've got the attitude that comes with being a young band who've just spent the last month in the studio recording an album, tentatively called `Revelation/s", which will more than fulfil the potential they displayed earlier this year when &dash. along with the likes of near neighbours Ride (both originally come from Oxford) and Teenage Fanclub &dash. they were seen as the frontrunners of the rising young guitar bands. 
Like Ride and TFC, Five Thirty have bypassed this year's indie / dance revolution, basing their success instead on a new guitar-dominated sound that lies somewhere between the caustic experimentation of My Bloody Valentine or Sonic Youth and the more accessible pop sound of the '60s <tag "532736">bands</> like The Byrds and The Who. 

800633
The team, who have been playing regularly in the Prison Service League since 1968, have until now always had to rely on their own resources as a means of funding their games. 
The team play at many national fixtures, competing for the Maunsell Trophy and the Oxford Cup.

Etta James, though, purveys the undiluted version. 
The format of her nine-piece Roots <tag "532736-p">Band</> says a lot. 

800636
Absurd though it may seem, it is quite likely that Mr Honecker and his companions genuinely believe all this. 
For the East German state is the realisation of the dreams of a young roofer as he grew up among the filth of the coal mines and steel mills of the Saarland in the Thirties. 
He and his fellow communists, enraged by the poverty, the unemployment and exploitation of the workers, would fight with the Nazi gangs, their strident shawm pipe <tag "532736">bands</> competing in decibel levels with the Nazis' drums and trumpets.   

800637
At its classical best, the line-up offers all the variety and flexibility you could want within the idiom. 
All the way through the set on Tuesday I kept thinking of the bands who have taken this format and embellished it over the decades: the wonderful Stax house band which backed Otis Redding, James Brown's polyrhythmic adventurers, Georgie Fame's Blue Flames, Van Morrison's Moondance band, the supremely sophisticated Earth, Wind and Fire, the thunderous Washington DC `go-go" bands of the mid-Eighties, Southside Johnny's Asbury Jukes, and others without number. 
The Roots <tag "532736-p">Band</> did the job perfectly, kicking Miss James through `Whatever Gets You Through the Night" and easing her through the slow-burn deep soul of `Your Real Good Thing is About to End". 

800638
The lighting was just right: contrasting shades for the interior-lit facades of the musicians' platforms and the big plain back-cloth; fuchsia and lemons, grey and ivory, mauve and lime green. 
The occasional back projection, such as a Manhattan-scape, looked very Fifties, in silver on purple like the old Capitol Records label. 
Helped by an enthusiastic and packed house, the <tag "532736">band</> romped confidently through the diverse set of Latin American rhythms represented on Byrne's Rei Momo LP.

The film was poorly written and acted, and utilised much stock footage of manoeuvres supplied by the Department of Defense.

TWO pupils at Peers School in Oxford have hit a high note with their musical and artistic talents. 
Sara Lambert, 18, impressed examiners with her flugal horn playing and won a place at the Royal Northern School of Music in Manchester, while 14-year-old Kelly Chandler notched up awards in a recent dance competition. 
Now Sara, who plays in the National Youth Brass <tag "532744-p">Band</>, is to study for a degree course at the RNCM.

He toured Europe and visited England with the band as recently as last May when he had not looked to be in good health. 
Ominously he was missing from the line-up when the band played at the Nice Jazz Festival. 
In May he recorded a session for the Basie <tag "532736">band's</> latest compact disc and has a fine six-minute feature to himself on Ellington's composition Do Nothin' Till You Hear From Me.

Nurtured from their East End up bringing under the patronage of Punk revolutionary Jimmy Pursey, producer of their debut `Flares &and. Slippers" EP, they fast became the sort of blokes you'd avoid in the kebab shop come chucking out time. 
A deal with EMI beckoned, and 15-year-old singer Stinky Turner was soon going on stage in his pyjamas and bawling, `You insult my intelligence but I a not a fool!" to the <tag "532736">band's</> legion of admirers (affectionately known as `The Rubber Glove Firm").

International or not, it was the Sandie Shaw episode which first brought the Smiths' sense of style into focus. 
Morrissey, in Record Mirror, modelled a black line suit to complement Sandie Shaw's black halter neck dress. 
It was obviously a send-up of The Face but it nevertheless reflected a certain smartening up in the <tag "532736">band</>.   

800646
The film itself, set in an American slum school where a classroom of thugs beat up their teacher, was not the stuff by which cinemas are normally packed. 
It contained one symbolic scene in which the kids smashed a friendly teacher's collection of jazz 78 records. 
But the magic moment was the assault of the title music played by the then little-known <tag "532736">band</> of Bill Haley and his Comets. 

800647
Drink and drugs were de rigeur and sleeping around was still very fashionable. 
Well, for me and the lads in the <tag "532736">band</> anyway."

Faded drama queen of '85: Midge Ure." 
Which was nothing more than a sideways stab at NME hipness coupled with a nod towards the absurd fitness fad.

Pop Scene caught up with the group before they left. 
Although they are unhappy at the state of the rock music industry in this country, the <tag "532736">band</> are anxious to make it clear that they do not intend to abandon Britain.

No, but it can have one bad effect. 
The Who were once called `the loudest rock <tag "532736">band</> in the world," and, coming together for a North American tour it has been revealed that singer Roger Daltrey and bass guitarist John Entwistle are both suffering hearing loss.   

800652
It is interesting to note that Ludus' then manager, Richard Boon (former Buzzcocks manager and `New Hormones" supremo) was later to move to Rough Trade and become instrumental in the signing of The Smiths. 
The Factory period intensified with the success of Joy Division and the astonishing failure of The Distractions.

These were to have a tremendous influence on the worldwide jazz revival to come. 
During the war Lu led a 20-piece navy band in Hawaii. 
On his release in March 1946 the Yuerba Buena <tag "532736">band</> reformed and moved back into the Dawn Club, which had now moved to Annie Street, a San Francisco alley immortalised in Watters's fine `Annie Street Rock". 

800659
The fact that we're all young adds fuel to the fire. 
It's easier to say, we're manipulated by adults than accusing a group that's <tag "532736-a">band</> members are, say, 25 or 30, of the same thing.

As an appeal to look at one of our most common prejudices it is worthwhile, but it says very little more than that we should be aware of the potential of old people to contribute to the community.

It would, however, be optimistic to conclude that the McLaren team demonstrated their ultimate capability here yesterday. 
They achieved provisional pole position despite problems associated with the oil tanks on the transverse six-speed gearboxes fitted for the first time at this Shell-sponsored race. 
Alain Prost qualified a disappointing fifth, complaining that a very slow gear-change was allowing the engine revs to drop off the power <tag "532734?">band</>.   

800664
The choice of the first (`Shakespeare's Sister") and the timing of the second (`That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore"), already available on `Meat Is Murder", coupled with a lack of airplay were given as reasons for their failure. 
The fact that the band refused to do videos and that very little TV promotion was given to these singles didn't help either. 
Life goes on however, and the <tag "532736">band</> have this week announced a series of Scottish dates.

Faced with documented discrimination in hiring, salaries, and advancement, most persisted in their allegiance to the system that had at least tentatively accepted their presence as individual workers. 
In order to appear successful, each woman architect had to stand apart from other women, both from her few peers and from the many beneath her in the hierarchy. 
To <tag "532746">band</> together with others facing similar difficulties would be to acknowledge that women, generically, were subordinate, and that the system was discriminatory.

Appropriately Bill had begun his career in Defiance, Ohio.

It may have been `Jesus On The Payroll" by Thrashing Doves or `Acid Tax" by Phuture, it didn't matter. 
Yet now we're told indie <tag "532736">bands</> shouldn't be allowed to make dance records (because they don't understand it), that at the start these bands wee quite rightly isolated by house (`Here was the nation's party in full swing and they couldn't get in").

They planned to go back on and complete their set with vocals from Cressa of The Stone Roses, who had been on the whole tour and knew most of the songs.

The most interesting findings, however, relate to the way in which these differences vary across schools. 
Gender differences, ethnic group differences and verbal reasoning band differences themselves vary from school to school and from a study of these we begin to glimpse some fascinating insights into school differences. 
Thus, whereas the average difference between pupils from verbal reasoning <tag "532903">band</> 1 and those from band 3 is 19 score points, at one extreme there is a school where this difference is found to be only 12 points and at the other extreme there is a school where this difference is 25 points.

Pat Kane, the reluctant pop star, is wearying of the predicable career path apparently mapped out for Hue And Cry.

Solar panels react fairly well over the visible light spectrum, which has a wavelength range of 400 nanometers for ultra-violet to 1,100 nanometers for infra-red light. 
However, the performance of monocrystalline cells drops off with the longer wavelengths of light in this spectrum. 
A multijunction cell, Solarex believes, should be more efficient as it uses layers of different crystals, each of which is optimised for a specific <tag "532734">band</> of the visible light spectrum.

IT'S the hottest night of the year at one of the sweatiest venues in West London, but the trio on stage have managed to pull the crowds away from the Sinopoli, Albert Hall bars and out on to the small, seething floor. 
The drummer looks like a Fifties rockabilly fan who has somehow kept his quiff, the enthusiastic figure on stand-up bass looks like an overgrown college boy, and the lead singer, huddled over his well-worn veteran Gretsch hollow-body guitar, sports greased-back hair, and looks as if he's been playing in bars almost every night of his life &dash. which is pretty much the truth. 
The Paladins, from San Diego, Southern California, are yet another great bar-room <tag "532736">band</> from the land where it seems that every small town has a roadhouse with a resident group who can bash out a solid, if often predictable mixture of rock'n'roll and blues.

The trio of mid-Seventies snarl-toothed rock albums, Fear, Slow Dazzle and Helen of Troy were the best-received work of his career. 
Cale became famous for violent demonstrations on stage; there were plenty of screams, stage props, a green surgeon's outfit, the odd tooth-spitting, the beheaded (but long dead) chicken episode which lost him half his <tag "532736">band</>, the time he wore the Cambridge Rapist's mask &ellip

Here also is to be found his finest <tag "532736-a">band</> work, on Hall's `Blues at Blue Note", where Shirley confirms himself as one of the most sympathetic of all jazz accompanists, and his contribution is fundamental to the marvellous playing of Hall, trumpeter Sydney de Paris and trombonist Dick Dickenson.

It is interesting to speculate what Juilliard could have offered Dixon for, although he is less well known for it, he was in fact a far better arranger than he was a tenor soloist. 
At this time he had what is known as a rehearsal <tag "532736">band</>, an informal group of musicians playing for the love of it, and the group included such emergent young talents as trumpeter Freddie Hubbard and trombonist/arranger Julian Priester.   

800702
What do the audience get from a live show? 
Basically it is an accessory to the already solid connection between <tag "532736">band</> and fans, a confirmation that the band exist as real working people and a chance for both sides to voice their appreciation of the other.

If Reynolds finds the atmosphere of these gigs so offensive, he should simply stay away from them, rather than inflict his Points Of View mentality on the thousands of people who may not pass his muster, but have just as much right to see live music as anyone.

They had only lasted three years, but that, as they implausibly claimed, had always been the plan, right from the moment singer Paul Heaton placed a postcard in his front-room window in Hull, inviting musicians to get in touch. 
The band receives a surrogate continuance in Heaton and drummer Hemmingway's latest incarnation, The Beautiful South. 
The hits, `Song For Whoever" and `You Keep It All In", reveal the same instinct for an infectious melody simply delivered, while a song like `I Love You (But You're Boring)" could only put you in mind of the group who once insisted on being promoted as `the fourth best <tag "532736">band</> in Hull".

Kenton's music never exactly replicated the swing sound. 
He was fascinated by a hybrid jazz that mixed pop, improvisation and classical borrowings into an elephantine, hyperbolic, sometimes truly adventurous music. 
Kenton hired a number of good female singers (including Anita O'Day early in the <tag "532736">band's</> career) and he brought in Illinois-born Christy in 1945.

Ball's estrangement from the Salvation Army was to be the secular brass band's gain. 
Soon after the Second World War, in which he worked with ENSA (or `Every-Night-Something-Awful", as he called it), he came to work for the music publishing firm of R. Smith and Co Ltd and served as editor of British Bandsman (the brass band world's leading newspaper since 1887) for 15 years.

Hancock's cardinal sin was to fully electrify his playing, funk up his rhythm section, and still claim to play jazz. 
Amid all the self-righteous vituperation at the time, it was appropriate that the group which did most to build bridges between the two camps should be the Jazz Crusaders.

He worked as a musician on a ship during school vacations and while at the University of San Francisco he played in a band at the Palace Hotel. 
Turning professional, he toured with Carol Lofner's band where he stayed for five years and then sailed to China as a ship's musician. 
Back in San Francisco, he worked with several groups and then formed his own 11-piece <tag "532736">band</> to play at Sweet's Ballroom in Oakland from 1938 to 1943.

More enduring was his notoriety within the British left, an association begun in the Young Communist League in 1928. 
Nine years later, he joined a small group of Trotskyists and from 1950 he was in charge of it for 35 years, engineering endless schisms and winning and losing thousands of followers through his organisational knack, tenacity, in turns ferocity and tenderness, oratory, a charismatic physical presence and an engaging sense of humour. 
His disgrace splintered his organisation, so that he ended his life with as tiny a <tag "532735">band</> as he led until 1956, when the Soviet invasion of Hungary prompted the defection of around 200 Communist Party activists and provided three key groups of cadre &dash. youth organisers, journalists and industrial militants &dash. and a coterie of usually despised but intermittently useful academic apologists.

SQUEEZE are one of those bands who seem much more significant in retrospect than they ever did at the time. 
Their output of simple tunes and funny lyrics, stuffed with articulate observations of a peculiarly English low-life, made them the Kinks of the Eighties, a sort of British Steely Dan. 
Their reappearance at the Town &and. Country in London generated much excitement, pulling in hundreds of pleasant-looking couples, who had consciously dressed down for the nostalgia of it &dash. much as the <tag "532736">band</> themselves had.

While at high school in 1926 when he was 15 he formed his own jazz band. 
He worked as a musician on a ship during school vacations and while at the University of San Francisco he played in a band at the Palace Hotel. 
Turning professional, he toured with Carol Lofner's <tag "532736">band</> where he stayed for five years and then sailed to China as a ship's musician. 

800748
Big numbers include a new version of The Pied Piper of Hamelin by the Junior Gang under the direction of Dave Dixon and his wife, Sandie. 
There's a potted version of Grease, a massed Minstrels number and a spectacular Clowns number which is costing wardrobe mistress Joyce Heath and her army of helpers `an arm and a leg to dress." 
As usual there will be a full-blown orchestra, buttressed with a few old-stagers from Oxford's big <tag "532765">bands</> of yesteryear, under the direction of Brian Richardson.   

800749
He pointed the gun at PC Michael Vernon and WPC Amanda O'Mahony as they approached, but they chased him despite believing the gun was real. 
ADAM NEWMAN, 18, a former pupil of Wood Green School, seems set to hit `the big time". 
Adam joined a rock <tag "532736">band</> during his A-levels and having left school now dedicates his time to the band. 

800750
`I could never stand any rider being in front of me, if there wasn't a gap to go through, I made one." he added. 
He also recalled the experiences with his team mate Eric Irons, whose equipment was so bad it looked as if it had come off the scrap heap. 
`We used to kid him, asking how many elastic <tag "532790">bands</> he had to hold the bike together, and his leathers were always full of holes." 

800751
On the B-side, `Fe So", a gentle traditional style eulogy, sung in Bambara, extolling the myriad charms of Mali. 
There are those who dislike the hi-tech, pan-African sound of Salif's last album, Soro, and yearn for the good old days of the Ambassadeurs du Motel with the great guitarists Kente Manfila and Ousmane Kouyate. 
Partly to appease the purists, Salif's latest <tag "532736">band</>, playing at the Town and Country Club on Sunday, was billed as a return to tradition. 

800752
Keyboard player Lawrence Williams, formerly with The Ocean, has recruited David Faulkner as an additional keyboard man, following the return of Al Zawawi to his native Oman. 
Outback, the didgeredoo-toting duo, play the Jericho Tavern on Thursday as a full band with a drummer and percussionist completing the line-up. 
The <tag "532736">band</>, who are on the verge of signing a record deal, are supported by Zimbabwean guitar and mbira duo Vana Ve Afrika.

Firstly, Quando Quango's roots were firmly planted within disco electrofunk. 
Quando remained a little known cult <tag "532736">band</> in England but aspired to a high degree of success in the New York dance floor market.   

800754
It had been a deliberate ploy to record the bulk of the tracks in Liverpool in order to keep The Smiths away well and truly away from the metropolis of London. 
Morrissey was now settled in Hale Barns but, unlike the rest of the <tag "532736">band</>, he was not seen in Manchester's trendier nightspots.   

800755
`But I have to admit, it's one of the reasons we're keeping the dates down to a minimum this time around. 
I mean, I love this <tag "532736">band</>, and I love the music, but I'm not crazy enough to lose my head over it." 

800756
`I doubt it," muses Carl, `but I admit we've been lucky and we've had a lot of coverage. 
Plenty of other good <tag "532736">bands</> around the country have tried to grab at th coat-tails the Manchester scene and failed as a result.

But the set then flipped into some tepid reggae and funk-rock. 
Armatrading was happy to let her bland five-piece <tag "532736">band</> be more than just a springboard for her songs. 

800758
A dangerous crush followed a surge at the front of the stage and the security subsequently panicked. 
As the minutes of silence and confusion unfolded, the crush eased and a visibly shaken <tag "532736">band</> were allowed back onstage. 

800759
There he played with Andy McGhee, another fine tenor player who later worked for Lionel Hampton, and with Lou Blackburn who became a trombonist in the Ellington orchestra. 
When he was in the army Dixon based his playing on that of Stan Getz, but, in search of a tougher sound, switched his loyalty to the Coleman Hawkins, Don Byas and Ben Webster school. 
Demobbed in 1953, he decided to make his living as a musician and progressed rapidly until, a year later, he was working with Cootie Williams's <tag "532736">band</> at the famous Savoy Ballroom.   

800760
But then The Residents aren't exactly your ordinary pop group. 
They are pop conceptualists, whose CV is littered with oddball projects and notions, many involving years of hard work for little or no kudos. 1974's Not Available, for instance, was originally intended to be released only when the group had forgotten about it (their record company released it, allegedly without their knowledge, five years later); Eskimo (1980) initiated their interest in anthropology, telling Eskimo tales in an archaic language while the Mole Trilogy (four albums, of course) told of the longstanding dispute between two mythical peoples, the Moles and the Chubs, and included one LP by a fictional <tag "532736">band</> called The Big Bubble.   

800761
The Theatre's spring programme includes welcome return visits from Millstream Touring with Anton Chekhov's The Sneeze and Tara Arts with Gogol's The Government Inspector. 
Britain's leading touring company specialising in new writing, Paines Plough, make their first visit to Chipping Norton with Crux, a new play by award winning young writer April de Angelis. 
The Theatre's rock and folk audience will welcome a return visit from guitarist John Renbourn in concert with Stefan Grossman, as well as concert by Albion <tag "532736-p">Band</> '90, Whippersnapper, and The Oyster Band.   

800762

How irrelevant the film's Britishness was to its international success was evident from the parallel success of Time Bandits (1981) in the American market. 
Produced by HandMade films, a company set up by the financier Denis O'Brien and ex-Beatle George Harrison to exploit the talents of the Monty Python team, Terry Gilliam's film is an inventive fantasy about a schoolboy who travels through time for meetings with Napoleon, Robin Hood and various other historical characters in the company of a <tag "532735">band</> of dwarves.   

800764
However, considering the tightly controlled aloofness and the fact that Joyce (whose contributions in a musical capacity are not in doubt) has led a deliberately low profile, one cannot blame Kent for the omission. 
This is a problem which the band themselves could easily solve by restructuring their media policy. 
This aloofness is crucially important in the context of a <tag "532736">band</> completely sold by the sadness of being disregarded.   

800765
The club is based at Kidlington sports centre. 
Winning ways: the Wantage Silver <tag "532747-p">Band's</> training group, pictured above, collected all the trophies in Section C at the recent Oxford and District Brass Band Association contest   

800766
A phone call to the company produced nothing but a (too) hasty denial that anything was wrong in Smithdom. 
Work on the final Rough Trade album, intriguingly, mysteriously entitled `Strangeways Here We Come" had been completed and the <tag "532736">band</> were, apparently, leading separate lives. 

800767
Next Saturday, July 22, teams compete in the Mawddach Rotary Wool Race at Cardigan Bay, ferrying wool, timber and minerals up the estuary to waiting ships (Beverly Barrett, tel: 0341-422341). 
A Tir, Aer a Dwr (land, air and water) celebration at the beautiful Lake Vyrnwy in Montgomeryshire, with abseiling, balloon flights and water-skiing from July 21-23 takes place against the background of brass <tag "532744-a">band</> music and sculpture trails.

But this autumn will provide the biggest test yet, with Dance Energy, a 10-part BBC2 series about the new `dance culture", to be screened at 6.30 pm on Mondays. 
The 40-minute programmes, shot in a London studio with live dancers and <tag "532736">bands</>, are hosted by lad about London (and Janet Street-Porter-pal) Normski.

Well that's an interesting {vocal sond="um"} parallel really. 
There is, indeed, a snake &dash. the <guess>Formosan <tag "533487">banded</> krait</guess> &dash. that gives you a type of instant miocencia, and the discovery that the venom of this animal contains a toxin that can do this has, indirectly, led to the elucidation of the mechanism behind miocenia gravis.

Katherine Morton, 15, pictured, who lives on the Horton cum Studley road near Beckley, plays in the City of Oxford Silver Band training section and won first prize in the solo section of the band's annual competition at the band room in Temple Cowley. 
She followed this success by taking the first prize in the solo section and the slow melody section in the junior solo championship of the Oxford and District Brass Bands' Association at Bayswater School, Oxford, on Sunday where she also played in the winning quartet. 
Katherine, a pupil at Wheatley Park School, also took a first prize for the slow melody section of the Swindon and District Brass <tag "532744-p">Band</> competition recently.

During the war Lu led a 20-piece navy band in Hawaii. 
On his release in March 1946 the Yuerba Buena band reformed and moved back into the Dawn Club, which had now moved to Annie Street, a San Francisco alley immortalised in Watters's fine `Annie Street Rock". 
In June 1947 Watters moved the <tag "532736">band</> to Hambone Kelly's in El Cerrito, where it stayed until Lu disbanded in 1950.

The Catalans like to see their red and yellow stripes, the Bretons their ermine, and there are similar tendencies in Yugoslavia, which is subject to imminent fragmentation. 
IN the West Indies the appropriately coloured rainbow flag for friendship can sometimes be used to replace the plethora of different ensigns (there are more ensigns than steel <tag "532756">bands</> among the islands), but mostly it has become merely an additional flag.

It got really silly. 
We drove all the way down in the snow but they caught us and said we couldn't have them; not surprisingly I suppose." 
The short Irish tour which followed proved to be a major turning point in the career of the <tag "532736">band</>.

Davison was used to bearing such disasters with fortitude. 
In 1932 he led a <tag "532736">band</> which included Frank Teschemacher, a clarinettist and jazz arranger with a similar potential to that of Bix Beiderbecke.  

800776
This doesn't just apply to those who have paid for the event. 
Barely a week into the tour, Johnny Marr was feeling the strain: `I feel like I'm in The Rolling Stones or any other rock <tag "532736">band</>," he said as the gruelling schedule began to etch away at the excitement generated by that first night.   

800777
Lord Plumb will be speaking on the effects of the European Community in 1990 on Friday, March 30 in the Masonic Hall, Woodstock. 
FOR the first time in recent years, the boys and girls of the 1st Longworth Scout <tag "532736">band</> will not be performing their dazzling routines when Oxfordshire's Scouts and Guides present their 1990 Gang Show at the Apollo Theatre next week.   

800778
The older of Franco's 17 children were educated in France and he expressed a desire that they should become lawyers or doctors, not musicians, which he admitted was what his father had wished for him. 
Previously a Catholic, he converted to Islam in 1981, taking the name Aboubakar Sidiki, though he never publicised this fact. 
With the rise of a new generation of smaller Zairean groups playing faster, harder music, albeit still based on the inimitable Congolese guitar sound, Franco's big <tag "532765">band</> became one of a sadly declining species, but his popularity and creativity never waned.

I was feeling more and more that rock music was just adding to the heap and that's what I think it is largely now. 
I think it's a dead bore, quite honestly, but it will continue for years like <tag "532765-a">big</> band jazz continues.   

800781
Not of his talent &dash. he always knew he was good and he always knew what a great songwriter and performer he was &dash. but for instance, he was nervous of audiences. 
The idea of touching people in the crowd or letting people in the crowd touch him was something that had not occurred to him, but to be beautiful and that remote &dash. you've got to get a crowd to touch him because that was what really got them wild. 
That was what caused the hysteria and enthusiasm and so, I felt that if the <tag "532736">band</> on stage was at least so close to his sense of humour that he felt comfortable with them, if the crew and all the support system was so strong that he could relax enough to enjoy the crowd, only then would it get magnetic and spontaneous.

Madonna defines her show as `a step between listening to music and watching a video".

Eric also worked for the great composer/ arranger Oliver Nelson, appeared on Oliver's distinguished Afro American Sketches album, and learned much from Nelson's unique approach to music. 
After working in the pit <tag "532736">band</> at Harlem's Apollo Theatre for four years, he made his first visit to Europe with drummer Curly Hamner to play in the Josephine Baker show in 1959. 

800786
In a way, no doubt, that suited Mr Wilson. 
The Tory jibe that always pleased him most was that the Labour Party was nothing but `a one-man <tag "532814">band</>" &dash. and since in 1964 he fought a more personally dominated campaign than any party leader since Churchill, it did to some extent play into his hands.

They represented a span from the nursery, education and the arts to gardening, racing and stock-breeding, to the pomp and circumstance of the imperial Britain into which she was born. 
Through six massed <tag "532736">bands</> and orchestras ranging from the Royal Marines to the National Youth Orchestra, she heard Soldiers of the Queen, composed in the year of her birth when Queen Victoria ruled, and Elgar's Imperial March, played at her wedding to the Duke of York 67 years ago when Elgar was still alive &dash. and after which she became instantly popular as the first royal to look cheerful in public.

However, it warns that there could be repeated devaluations to offset higher inflation. 
An alternative scenario, in which the pound is allowed to fluctuate within the narrower 2.25 per cent <tag "532734">bands</> applied to most other EMS currencies, could halve underlying inflation but `with considerable costs" to employment and growth. 

800792
The Smiths, for example, while signed to Rough Trade, are handled and distributed by the major London Records. 
A minor band signed to London like, say, Easterhouse, are fully distributed by Rough Trade. 
So exactly who is the independent <tag "532736">band</>?   

800793
We told him to sling his hook &ellip. then a week later he got busted." 
No reason was given for the departure of Rourke at the time, and this only served to intensify speculation. 
For starters, there was Rourke's well known problem with heroin which had always grated against Morrissey's concept of the <tag "532736">band</> being vegetarian, celibate and literary.  

800795
Dropped by Virgin, they went off to produce a new album by themselves, which was good enough to get them signed by Virgin subsidiary 10 Records. 
Fire In The Mountain continues their collision of jazz, pop, funk, latin and rap styles, now performed by an unexpected collection of musicians. 
With the departure of singer Julie Roberts, the <tag "532736">band</> now consists of guitarist Simon Booth, fresh from his work with the British acid jazz scene, and veteran saxophonist Larry Stabbins.   

800796
It's ironic that you should still make excuses for the fact that the band can play really well, yet there's nothing here that can't be appreciated on the level of a blues number. 
In retrospect, it now seems odd that they were considered the ultimate heavy metal band. 
Perhaps <tag "532736">bands</> with a dark side, with occult associations, will always be lumped into the HM category.   

800797
It is a genetic condition which causes the contraction of a joint, most commonly in the fingers, due to the overgrowth of fibrous tissue. 
In a severe case, <tag "533495">bands</> of tissue form under the skin of the palm and, within six months of the first bumps appearing, the fingers are drawn inwards and can become useless.   

800798
It also comes naturally to them to include any musical form with a sharp sense of its own absurdity; ska, for instance (there are touches of Madness here) or a hyperactive brand of rhythm and blues (they become almost a French Blues Brothers on Marcelle Ratafia). 
And with all of these forms, unless the delivery is precise, the comic energy simply drains away. 
Consequently things only started to get funny around four songs in, just as the <tag "532736">band</> began bringing the stops off cleanly and ending in the same places.   

800800
Visitors to the city's first Green Fair, organised by the Oxford Green Party, browsed through more than 50 stalls and exhibitions. 
They were invited to bring old garden tools to be refurbished and sent to farmers in the Third World and to take part in `acupunctural planning" &dash.  sticking pins in a map of Oxford to show where they would like environmental improvements. 
Other attractions included a demonstration of how worms can be used to turn household waste into compost, music from local <tag "532736">bands</>, videos, debates and vegetarian food.   

800801
If the venue which staged the Dickies gig which he moaned about had imposed such a bigoted, snobbish door policy then, if his account is anything to go by, the audience would have considered one of intolerant wanker and a small number of his friends. 
A promoter's (and <tag "532736">band's</>) paradise, surely.   

800802
Test cricket, Rugby internationals, the Derby, and the Cup Final were established favourites. 
The annual rowing contest between the two ancient universities was a great London event with many ordinary families taking sides and wearing favours but it was hardly a matter of `national" concern until the BBC included the Boat Race in the select <tag "532735">band</> of truly British events.   

800803
Their local reputation spread, and Watters revealed himself as a capable composer in the tradition of his idols, writing such memorable numbers as `Sage Hen Strut", `Big Bear Stomp", `Emperor Norton's Hunch" and `San Andreas Fault". 
Within the Dawn Club the <tag "532736">band</> played in a huge room.

Needless to say, they were well primed for The Smiths.

However, Lamont will almost certainly announce a further increase in tax liability on company cars.

Gumball, the new band formed by ex-Dinosaur Jr and BALL man Don Fleming and who support Teenage Fanclub on their UK tour, release their debut EP on Paperhouse records this week. 
The tracks are `All The Time" backed with `Yellow Pants", `Gettysburg" and `Gettysburg (Twister Mix)". 
Also in the <tag "532736">band</> are Jay Spiegel on drums and Eric Vermillion on bass.   

800812
The Smiths fit neatly into this strategy as the exception to the rule. 
That The Smiths dismiss the all important mediums of video fashion and Fairlight affected pulsebeat, yet maintain their status as an immensely successful chart band, is itself a feat worthy of praise. 
This `outsider" stance is, of course, nothing new, and if it bore the bulk of the <tag "532736">band's</> appeal, would be nothing more than a gimmick in itself.   

800813
I was sort of Pete's (Pete Townshend's) plaything and we'd go out clubbing afterwards, invent all these dances, the most painful one was the `Bite-your-ankle".' 
Ostensibly he was the <tag "532736">band's</> compere. 

800814
What The Smiths have gained, by remaining with Rough Trade, has been a far greater artistic control. 
Morrissey has been able to design all the record covers and, with the possible exception of `This Charming Man New York", the band have remained as decision makers in regard to single releases, a measure of control practically unheard of in larger companies. 
To all other intents and purposes then, The Smiths are a major <tag "532736">band</> with major backing.   

800815
Whatever enforced their absence for the last couple of years, it wasn't an extensive search for a new musical direction. 
Second-hand soul, funky horns, wandering blues-style vocals, all derivative life is here. 
The <tag "532736">band</>, made up of sophisticated London rich boys, never really looked happy as teen heart-throbs. 

800816
The third thing is that when a traveller/presenter films a scene, it is very rarely spontaneous. 
It sounded spontaneous when he and the producer planned it on their recce (oh, yes, all these trips are done twice, once without cameras and once with, and I wonder if you can guess which is the nicer one), but now they have come to film that moment when the <tag "532736">band</> arrives to unpack their instruments at the temple, it rapidly loses all freshness.

Too late to meet the deadline for this week's Letters Page was a note of thanks from the Rector of Abingdon, the Rev. 
David Manship, to members of Abingdon Band for their contribution to a `Songs of Praise" service for Mothering Sunday last weekend.

Heywood Hill's brother-in-law, John Hill, who ran that most individual of decorating firms, Green and Abbott of Hanover Square, provided the wallpapers.

Next, materialising from here and there in the crowd, came members of the brotherhood, all, as Dora observed, looking extremely haggard.

The lyrics, courtesy of Patrick, are no doubt what he imagines to be a forthright voice of protest &dash. chiefly gay rights, with the obligatory anti-Thatcher statement in `Margaret's Injection ` &dash. but by simply whinging and not offering any hope or solution, they sound like petulant children throwing a tantrum, with Patrick's squalling vocal not helping things. 
Such constant complaining, so often the indie guitar ghetto's stock-in-trade, clearly has its market &dash. witness the few dozen intense-looking young men in front of the stage &dash. so that a <tag "532736">band</> as musically inventive as KOD appear a little cynical in taking such a soft option with their words.

Instead of their electrifying wah wah guitar and frantic vocals it was simply the sound of a classic powerpop trio going through a pure, well-cut pop song. 
However, any doubts people might have had about the band falling victim to their label's commercial thrusts have been removed by their latest single (and second Single Of The Week), `Air Conditioned Nightmare". 
A long time live favourite, it boasts everything that has taken the <tag "532736">band</> from the obscurity of earning five quid a day selling sandwiches to their current position.

The dancing was interesting, amusing and varied, its highlights including a solo in which the poor suitor, played by Brian Shaw, tried to commit suicide, and comic dances for two other male dancers, Alexander Grant as the black king and Peter Clegg as his witch doctor. 
Two women who at this time spent much of their professional lives appearing as second cast in Fonteyn's roles, Pamela May and Pauline Clayden, were given a chance to create the parts of the mother and daughter, which they carried off with stylish humour.

She paces dangerously around the stage claiming everything in sight, including Solor, with the naive greed of a woman indulged since childhood. 
Technically she still has some rough edges &dash. a peremptoriness in her phrasing, an uncertain control over her own force &dash. but the full easy strength of her dancing and the scale of her projection promise important things to come.

This function was not often required during peace-time and so the ceremonial aspects became more important, as illustrated by Lane's role in the Cenotaph ceremony, at which he `held the baton" every year from 1987, when he was elected as Senior Director of Music to the Household Division. 
Lane first joined the band of the Royal Army Medical Corps as a youth, and progressed through Kneller Hall to the bandmastership of the 10th Royal Hussars in 1964 and subsequently to the Royal Hussars, followed by brigade bandmastership of the Greenjacket Brigade and then to director of music of the <tag "532736">bands</> of the Women's Royal Army Corps, the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst Band Corps and finally, in 1977, to the Irish Guards.

For a second the fifteen-percent figure made me unhappy, and then I thought, Fine, yes, I welcome all this imperfect mingling &dash. I want this circling refluxion of our old reconditioned pleasures and our new genuine ones to continue for years, decades, until it becomes impossible to trace backward the history of any particular liking, just as it was impossible to unstir the rash dollops of red or yellow tint my mother used to add to the custom-mixed paints she got from Sears: she used old peanut butter jars as receptacles, and sat cross-legged in the side yard pouring imperceptibly different yellow-greens from one jar to another, refining the color that she wanted for the porcelain-knobbed dresser in my sister's room, though the young technician in the paint department at Sears had with apparently scientific precision injected what seemed to me a perfectly acceptable series of squirts of yellow, cyan, and magenta from the paint organ into a white base, according to the recipe in a notebook for the sample chip my mother had matched to the border of a cloth calendar. 
She was closing in now on her idea; she had long since made use of the one free stirrer that came with the can of paint, and was now, `warming" the dresser-color-to-be by dipping a pencil in a tiny can of old Rust-Oleum and holding it above the peanut butter jar so that a stream of red fell, disappearing entirely at first and pooling in an invisible bulb of unmixedness at the heart of the host hue, and then later, as the pencil's burden lightened, thinning to a stretched rubber band's breadth frail enough to remain caught on the surface, recording in Spirograph patterns the minute trembles of her hand and the light breezes that unplumbed the paint's angle of descent. 
Again she dipped the pencil in the red and held it over the jar; and then, although I was sure that she could have had no real knowledge of how large the reservoir of potential warmth was that hung somewhere in the midst of the yellow-green, waiting to tint it, she said, `I think that will do it," and stirred, and then she poured this new mixture into another jar of slightly lighter color, thereby interpolating a shade between them &dash. and that was the color my sister's small dresser was painted, a color that may have been close to celadon but was probably more of an ocher, that formed the background to the brown rubber <tag "532838">bands</> I stretched between the porcelain knobs in L shapes and triangles, imagining I was threading tan magnetic tape around the capstans of a tape recorder, from which I plucked unpleasant tunes with my eyes closed.

No wonder the <tag "532736">band</> gained an injunction stopping the film being shown at the time: it paints a picture completely at odds with our own vision of Lord Jagger and the Stones &dash. the band who, in the Nineties, have played at Prince William's fifteenth birthday party, supported the Archbishop of Canterbury in her campaign for the poor in London's Docklands and headlined Prince Charles's `It Really Is Appalling" tour to raise funds for a National School for Proper English ('I can dig where the cat's coming from on forgotten forms of the language," Richards said at the press launch).

A trip to North London in the middle of the week is hardly an inviting prospect but the Cube Club at the Bull And Gate in Kentish Town on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday nights has made the nearby tube station seem like a home from home for the discerning music lover. 
The amiable Cube boys &dash. Chris, Pat and Mark &dash. have continually promoted a wide variety of up and coming acts in a friendly setting and with three <tag "532736">bands</> a night you can usually find something to make your ears prick up.

These moves were of course well intentioned, but led to bizarre scenes in the West End of London.

Although widely regarded as an excellent `debut", it didn't really capture the band's fiery live shows. 
Instead of their electrifying wah wah guitar and frantic vocals it was simply the sound of a classic powerpop trio going through a pure, well-cut pop song. 
However, any doubts people might have had about the <tag "532736">band</> falling victim to their label's commercial thrusts have been removed by their latest single (and second Single Of The Week), `Air Conditioned Nightmare".

THE day the Tour de France came to Puylaurens started early for Christian Falco. 
He had been up all night basting and garnishing a 600-kilogram ox roasting over a wood fire outside the covered market in this tiny hilltop town in south-west France. 
Falco, a beefy, bearded master of cuisine diabolique from Montpellier, had been roasting his vast joint over an open-air spit since Wednesday, watched by a <tag "532735">band</> of young admirers.

The real break for the Wallabies came in the 36th minute when Michael Lynagh hoisted the ball, Greg Martin thundered in beneath it, Jason Little arrived in support and over went Tim Horan. 
The forwards, Peter FitzSimons celebrating his first appearance with forceful foraging, recovered from a 15-yard backward shunt at the second scrum, to subdue the French, and in the second half, Australia continued to raise their game and the hopes of a faithful <tag "532735">band</> of followers.

ADAM NEWMAN, 18, a former pupil of Wood Green School, seems set to hit `the big time".

Nobody wanted to risk losing that interview. 
Those who thought that Morrissey's profile in 1984 was becoming detached from the rest of the band certainly couldn't have appreciated the enormous media attention he generated in spring 1985. 
If there was, as Morrissey had previously hinted, a certain amount of jealousy within the <tag "532736">band</> then this must have intensified ten-fold as Morrissey captured a limelight which made Boy George seem like a recluse.

800889
But professionally, you can do much of it with your programme. 
You create an interest by having appealing people to speak, by arranging debates that will be gripping, even controversial, by having one or more celebrities present, by asking a well-known <tag "532736">band</> to perform, by offering special food, by spectacle, by drama, by electronic presentations.

Elephants used to wander majestically about. 
Baboons left golfers cursing as they whipped up the balls, and hippos invaded the greens. 
Puff adders and spitting cobras and the odd python were there for the treading and the <tag "533487">banded</> mongoose was the golfer's best friend.

On this day: Westminster Bridge was formally opened, 1750; the Suez Canal was formally opened at Port Said, 1869; Hungary was proclaimed an independent republic, 1918. 
William Edward ('Wild Bill') Davison, cornettist, valve trombonist, vocalist, bandleader, born Defiance Ohio 5 January 1906, died Santa Barbara California 14 November 1989. 
HE WAS called `the indestructible Wild Bill" and, seeing him playing with such fire and energy on tour over here with Art Hodes and the John Petters <tag "532736">band</> earlier this year, I came to believe that he had done a deal with somebody over the business of living forever.   

800893
`Two years ago if you said you liked Mick Jagger it would be the end of your career, but now it's suddenly cool to like them," says vocalist Simon. 
But then these <tag "532736">bands</> don't realise they can't make records as good as the Stones.   

800894
But ultimately, it is terribly bland. 
Del Amitri are at last receiving some chart attention with another single, taken from their excellent Waking Hours LP, titled Move Away Jimmy Blue (A &and. M). 
Each single so far has featured a previously unreleased track on the b-side &dash. the latest has a good song called Another Letter Home &dash. so the <tag "532736">band</> must already have enough material for a second album.

CARTER THE UNSTOPPABLE SEX MACHINE, currently recording their second LP in South London (provisionally entitled `4 Weeks At The Betty Ford"), have set up a Christmas mini-tour. 
There will be a different support <tag "532736">band</> every night and everyone attending the London Town And Country Club gig will get a free 7-inch single &dash. featuring an as yet undecided live track from the Anytime, Anyplace, Anywhere tour and a track from the new LP, due for release in early 1991.

`I was surprised, because they hadn't really discussed it at all." 
Julianne was also full of praise for the Chipping Norton Studios, where the <tag "532736">band</> recorded their second album, Scarlet And Other Stories, a combination of folksy ballads and anthemic rock.

Achieve the effect by having a number of loudspeakers at lowish level, preferably facing in the same direction. 
There is no problem with amplifying a speaker's voice because in a room of any size you do not hear the individual's voice as such and the electronic sound reaches everywhere at the same time. 
Music is more complicated because electronic sound travels faster than natural sound, so people hear the `real" <tag "532736">band</> a fraction of a second after they've heard its electronic reproduction.

Destroyed a few 17-year olds' ambitions for a while, I can tell you." 
Five Thirty's ambitions were rekindled earlier this year when the band (still essentially the same &dash. Tara on bass and vocals, schoolmate Paul Bassett on guitar and vocals and new drummer Phil Hopper) re-released `Catcher In The Rye" as part of their alternative `debut" single, `Abstain". 
Although less `angry" than in its earlier incarnation, this time it was a Sounds' single Of The Week &dash. not a bad achievement for a <tag "532736">band</> whose rise had only begun in earnest a little under a year ago.

It seems definite now that the gold deposits here have commercial potential." 
Glencar Explorations, the company that holds the prospecting licence jointly with a British company, Andaman Resources, is one of 20 mining concerns currently investigating gold deposits in Northern Ireland and the Republic. 
As its diamond-tipped drill moves from place to place along a rock <tag "532736">band</> that stretches through the Mweelrea Mountains and the Sheeffry Hills, local concern is growing.

`In 1969 I started getting into progressive music.

Compare that with the figure of twenty-seven million which was the entire output of the very popular Victor Silvester and his strict-tempo ballroom orchestra in its whole career up to that time. 
Haley himself, a plumpish, thirtyish, dance band leader with a kiss-curl plastered damply on his forehead, had spent years playing for high school hops. 
He had realized that no <tag "532736">band</> was providing what the high school audience wanted, which was a strong, indeed stupefying, beat.

We rehearsed from 1am till 7." 
The Yerba Buena jazz band (Yerba Buena &dash. `Good Earth" &dash. was the original name of San Francisco) used a tuba and a banjo in the rhythm section, as opposed to string bass and guitar in conventional bands of the time. 
This meant that the <tag "532736">band</> had momentum rather than lift, and it did not swing so much as lurch.

Kenny `Pancho" Hagood was one of several fine baritone singers who patterned their styles on that of the influential Billy Eckstine in the 1940s. 
Like Earl Coleman, Johnny Hartman and Arthur Prysock, Hagood started his career as a band singer and was featured from 1946 to 1948 with the Dizzy Gillespie orchestra. 
His most famous recording with the Gillespie big <tag "532765">band</> was a lush ballad, `I Waited For You", which he also sang in a film called Jivin' in Bebop.

Among the latter half was Bella Bella, a group Kanda Bongo Man sang with at the age of 16: `I loved the <tag "532736">band</> as it played such sweet melodies."  

800911
They were paid for with #400 raised by carol singing last Christmas. 
The <tag "532736">band</> decided to buy them because one of their members, Mrs Jean Lidbury of West Hanney, benefitted from a similar machine after injuring her back in a road accident.

Bert Bales, pianist, died 26 October San Francisco, aged 87. 
During the Forties he led his own group, and also played in the Lu Watters band. 
Later he worked in <tag "532736">bands</> led by trumpeters Bob Scobey and Marty Marsala.

Already he admitted: {deadGuys}. 
One of the minds he was referring to was that of William Martin Murphy, a member of the `Bantry <tag "532735-p">Band</>" who had ousted Parnell.

The musical equivalent of a hair shirt, The Velvet Underground have been the subject of perhaps the most disproportionate press coverage and repackaging in rock, given the slim nature of their oeuvre. 
The Best Of The Velvet Underground (Words And Music Of Lou Reed, just in case you'd forgotten) is a substantial collection, excellent value though perhaps a little economical with the truth of the Velvets' career. 
By judicious selection &dash. mainly involving ignoring the <tag "532736">band</>'s thornier, avant-garde side &dash. Polydor have managed to make them seem more like the kind of mainstream rock band you could take home to Mom, rather than the dominant underground influence on an entire generation.

His wife Eva, who raced an MG at Le Mans in 1935, supported him strongly in his Bugatti activities, and one of his sons races a Bugatti today. 
NORMAN BROMMELLE was one of a small <tag "532735">band</> of scientists who in the immediate post-war period forsook scientific research in order to become a conservator of works of art.

Other patrons in the party included Miss Ann Ryan, Mr Owain Williams, the Abbot of Downside Dom John Roberts, and Mr and Mrs John Monckton. 
The hard working ball organisers Miss Fiona Halpin, Miss Georgina Rapinet, and Mr Peter de Soissons, were present; also the Hon. Adam and Mrs Macmillan, and Mr and Mrs Michael Rapinet were among others enjoying this excellent dance, which, Lord Craigmyle said, was `Fun for everyone and funds for pilgrims"! the Slaughter House Seven played during dinner; and after the auction, which was most efficiently conducted by the Chairman of the OmV Mr Stephen Macklow-Smith, Mr Dick Ritchie of Continental Airlines, who had donated the top prize which was a trip for two to Houston, Texas for a week, said a few words. 
Then there was dancing to the Wendy Roberts <tag "532736-p">Band</>, and the William Bartholomew discotheque.

The composer conducted, as he will again on Friday when his short London residence produces three more premieres &dash. two of them, intriguingly, orchestral transcriptions from Liszt, beating the old plagiarist at his own game. 
In a programme note to Fearful Symmetries, Adams acknowledges the `unrespectability" of its relentless <tag "532782-a">dance-band</> beat and brazen extrovert sonorities, drawing a comparison between himself and Ravel as composers whose scores come in contrasting pairs: `Along with every dark, introspective, serious piece there must come &ellip. the garish, ironic wild card that threatens to lose me whatever friends the previous composition might have gained."

800919
The musical memories conjured by Flying Cowboys include, in places, Laura Nyro and The Young Rascals. 
For many of these tracks, it is simply a case of the <tag "532736">band</> hitting a rolling, laid-back groove and riding it for as long as seems right, a situation beautifully suggested on the lazy reggae coda of `Ghetto Of My Mind", where the instruments pull out and leave her and the backing vocalists stranded; Rickie Lee asks `Hey, mister &dash. can we have our ball back?", and the groove snaps back in right on cue.

For example, a fall of 10 per cent in house prices reduced a #200,000 by #20,000 but took only #10,000 off a #100,000 house. 
This has the effect of reducing the gap between the different <tag "532734">bands</> of property in the market so that it can be worthwhile to knock down the price of your current home if you're trading up to a larger one that is selling at a reduced price. 

800922

In fact, almost as good as last year in Newport. 
All I can say is that All will probably never be as popular as other <tag "532736">bands</>, both British and American, but they will always be one of the best in my opinion.   

800925
THE MIDDLE of the road is a dangerous place for a young pop band to pitch its tent &dash. so many that do so are run over by press disfavour and public disinterest. 
Yet, with Deacon Blue getting the high score covering Bacharach &and. David songs, and a lot of new bubblegum little more than MOR, `Sundrive Road" couldn't have arrived at a better time, when there must be a pay-out for mature bands making no bones about playing pop for its own sake. 
Although Swim hail from Dublin you will only be able to infer their Celtic roots &dash. they're not a <tag "532736">band</> that wear their heart on their sleeve.

The sounds of the flutes, pipes and drums (250 marching <tag "532806">bands</> in Belfast alone) for the July 12 celebrations have signalled the start of a season of sectarian tension which has remained dangerously potent for three centuries.

Soon after the Second World War, in which he worked with ENSA (or `Every-Night-Something-Awful", as he called it), he came to work for the music publishing firm of R. Smith and Co Ltd and served as editor of British Bandsman (the brass band world's leading newspaper since 1887) for 15 years. 
Here he invested the paper with some of the most wisely conceived editorial pieces in its long history and was a great Christian witness in the world of secular bands. 
His success as a conductor of contesting <tag "532736">bands</> was immediate, with victories at the National Brass Band Championships in 1946 (with Brighouse and Rastrick Band) and at the Belle Vue September Contest, Manchester, in 1948 and 1952, with the now-defunct Co-operative Workers Society (CWS) Manchester Band, being the highlights.

Chris Barber: 
In 35 years on the road, the various editions of the Barber <tag "532736">band</> have made a few crossovers of their own, into skiffle, blues and boogie as well as the fundementalist New Orleans style which still inspires the leader's earthy trombone.

Sheffield Wednesday &ellip.0 Wimbledon &ellip.1 THIS was one of the significant results of the season, bringing three points that might save their First Division status for Wimbledon and, conversely, relegate Wednesday. 
Less than 14,000 watched on a wild, wet but not cold afternoon, mostly in dumb resignation, later in mounting alarm. 
Only Wimbledon's supporters, a little <tag "532735">band</> in the upper tier of the re-opened Leppings Lane, found much to enjoy in 90 minutes of what veteran reporters were nominating as the worst First Division match they had ever seen.   

800934
`All the music tonight will bring back warm and comforting memories as it reflects the changing fashions of the first 90 years of this century" said Fleming. 
Not so, since the music reflected very little but a taste for brass <tag "532744">bands</> and popular ditties.

Freddie gave her the help and advice she needed, and the lady eventually rang off without ever knowing she had dialled the wrong number. 
Clayton, who became a trumpet-player of extraordinary power and flexibility, learned to play on his brother's horn, joining the first of many brass bands in Edinburgh when he was seven. 
By the age of 14 he was earning money playing for the Dick Denny <tag "532736-p">Band</> at the Edinburgh Palais de Danse. 

800936
As a producer `Space Oddity" was very important to me as it was only my second or third record and I was looking forward to seeing David play it live. 
The gig was at the Purcell Rooms and he was playing with a band called Junior's Eyes. 
Obviously he built up to `Space Oddity" being somewhere in the middle of the set and about half way through the set, he dismissed the {typo bad="banmd",good="<tag "532736">band</>"}.

Right now he's probably the number one rock star and teen idol in the Soviet Union something impossible to imagine several years ago. 
Tsoy is half-Korean and from the underbelly of Leningrad's punk community: he used to accompany the band Swine on rhythm guitar in 1981. 
In 1982 he started his <tag "532736">band</> Kino, who have grown into the powerful guitar quartet with a distinctive style; nice pop melodies and hooky chord changes, monotonous vocals and punk drive.   

800938
He travelled the Continent playing for British troops with Geraldo, taking over from Leslie `Jiver" Hutchinson and playing Harry-James-style feature numbers. 
His procession through the big <tag "532765">bands</> took him next to that of Sydney Lipton and then to Ambrose.

The frequency range of your scanning receiver is crucial. 
If the receiver can't tune into the critical 900-950 MHz <tag "532745">band</> used for most mobile phone con versations, you'll have blown #400 on a radio whose chief asset is that it receives Radio Two at 20 places on the dial instead of only six. 

800940
They knew, from day one, the possibility of causing offence and that their case would be misconstrued in the media. 
If a mistake was made, it was lifting `Suffer Little Children" on to the back of the single, a decision which was entirely down to the <tag "532736">band</>.

But it's a pleasant enough bunch of tunes &dash. and maybe if multitalented songwriter and lead singer Gary Newby, who produced the aforementioned single and designed the album's record sleeve, is allowed to produce more of his songs in the studio, the band could live up to their undoubted promise. 
Another band who are almost very good are the Katydids, who played the Old Fire Station in Oxford this week. 
Here's another case of a good <tag "532736">band</> fighting to get out of a studio straightjacket &dash. better live than on record. 

800942
A rumour began to circulate around the cocktail bars of the music biz e&acute.lite that The Smiths were unhappy with Rough Trade and, although still tied with contracts, were seeking to move away. 
Obviously every record company in Britain wasted no time in sniffing out the possibilities of picking up the band. 
(A <tag "532736">band</> of this stature would be worth a costly legal battle).

A tap on each shoulder, the laying on of a sash, a perfunctory smile, a few words, and it is over. 
Mechanical, perhaps, and, as the <tag "532736">band</> plays airs from `Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head", ordinary and faintly bathetic.

Anger had reduced his pupils to pinpoints and he was unhealthily pale. 
There was also a tiredness in the lines about his eyes and a slight stoop in what had previously been a notably erect body. 
As she took this in, the bass line of a rock <tag "532736">band</> began its distinctive thump, thump, thump over their heads.

He's a heterosexual feminist's bad dream, nothing to fault in his new man credentials, but despite, or perhaps because of this apparent perfection, a prize creep.

The cover might be a sub-Tolkien fantasy folly, but don't be put off. 
What makes Cerebral Fix &dash. ex-Sounds EP stars &dash. stand out is the way they're busy twisting things around in the Death / Doom category. 
And that, in a strand of metal that's rapidly dying on its feet due to excessive plagiarism and a glut of shite <tag "532736">bands</>, means they're way above almost anything the Yank corpse grinders can manage.

As well as an ill-conceived appearance in a Tracey Ullman video, and whole-heartedly joining in the chorus of the ghastly Labour pop song `Meet the Challenge, Make the Change", he has confessed he once strummed guitar in his bedroom with a school skiffle group. 
The Walworth Road image makers, perhaps not wishing to add to the sorry catalogue, recently suggested that he should turn down the opportunity to emulate George Bush, who posed on his Presidential inauguration with 100 rock guitarists. 
Mr Kinnock was invited to sing with The Comets (Bill Haley's <tag "532736">band</>) in Cardiff, but gracefully declined.

Why do cyclists adorn themselves with fluorescent <tag "532732">bands</>, have a luminous wand attached to their machine and wear a crash helmet, yet weave in and out of traffic when there is a perfectly sign-posted cycle track available parallel to the traffic-congested road?

Ofgas director general, Mr James McKinnon, said that he has `analysed the comments of British Gas's dissatisfied customers" and expects the matter to be resolved `as soon as practicable". 
Measures that British Gas are being asked to consider include:  Expanding the number of bands in the price schedule;  Allowing different trading groups to aggregate gas supplies in order to qualify for price discounts; 
Buffering the impact of changing from one <tag "532736">band</> to another; and  Providing transition periods of up to three years for any customer facing heavy price increases.

Formed by the enigmatic Arthur Kadmon, Ludus became a vehicle for Linder's obscure and often unintelligible feminist lyrical and visual montages. 
A strange band, they rode a jazzy musical offshoot which often bordered on directionless experimentalism. 
They were interesting rather than entertaining and yet, to this day, remain Morrissey's favourite <tag "532736">band</>.

All good dirty fun. 
It's quite remarkable to think this is the same <tag "532736">band</> responsible for take like covering Abba's `Gimme Gimme Gimme (A Man After Midnight)".

Either chart published in Sounds &dash. the big one or the indies &dash. is acceptable. 
BUDDY REYNOLDS (Sound Off), October 27) it must have taken a real strike of genius to suggest that The Levellers' manager bar their so called `crusties" from their gigs. 
In the future, I suppose, these `social rejects" can remain outside the venue while, inside, the <tag "532736">band</> sing such lyrics as `There's only one way of life, and that's your own."

The senior band, under musical director Mr Steve Clark, has had a lean year, but `hope springs eternal". 
Mr Willett's suggestion that combined music-making evenings on a `home-and-away" basis could be arranged with one of the other bands needing players was well received, notably by the still optimistic leaders. 
To mark their tireless devotion, Mr George Tutte, the <tag "532736">band's</> founder, proposed that George and Audrey Willett be made vice-presidents.   

800960
The effect is laid-back but insistent, and very more-ish; as the press release states coyly, Cumbias are `Colombia's Most Addictive Export". 
It's the surface textures that set Cumbia music apart, trombones and clarinets combining with guitars in a manner akin to a Mexican mariachi band, whilst occasional button-accordion adds further hints of Tex-Mex and Cajun styles. 
The nine-piece <tag "532736">band</> Peregoyo Y Su Combo Vacana offers a more expansive, jazzy approach on their 1972 classic album Tropicalisimo.

SKYDIVERS, helicopters and festival fun came to Cutteslowe Park, Oxford, on its annual open day. 
The event, opened by Lord Mayor of Oxford Mrs Queenie Hamilton included a show by the Skydivers Parachute Display Team, helicopter rides and music from Oxford's Silver <tag "532747-p">Band</> and Hurricane Force Steel Band.

Anyway. at the time, I thought, `This is ridiculous, I'm holding these boys back" because I was also managing a singer called Marc Bolan, and in the quieter moments, he and David would decorate my office to fill in the time, but I said to them that I had just run out of money and couldn't afford to carry on &dash. I'd taken no commission from either of them at the time &dash. so I went off to Spain to think about my next move and released them both from their contracts.

There is, in fact, no means-limit on criminal legal aid, although some recipients pay means-tested contributions. 
Since the mid-Seventies, when policies first appeared, legal expenses insurance has concentrated on a narrow <tag "532734">band</> of claims arising from car accidents and house ownership; many policies are cheap add-ons to house insurance.  

800964
The greatest statements have been made on horns &dash. the oblique defiance of Miles Davis or the wounded romanticism of Chet Baker, the unfolding melodic storytelling of Lester Young, the volcanic eruptions of Charlie Parker or John Coltrane. 
The electric guitar was born out of jazz, but despite majestic excursions by the late Wes Montgomery and others, soul and passion have been more usually associated with the instrument in the hands of blues artists, the tributary that founded virtually all rock-guitar styles. 
A musician who has straddled these territories is John Scofield, the bearded, high-domed 37-year-old Ohio guitarist who plays in London on Monday night opposite Andy Sheppard and the Orphy Robinson <tag "532736">band</>.   

800965
I enjoyed these performances enormously for their vigour, freshness and style; I do not feel any great interpretive depths are being plumbed, however &dash. for that, try Klemperer. 
In similar vein, the new recording from the Hanover <tag "532736-p">Band</> of Schubert's Great C Major Symphony, the latest in their Schubert cycle, is also worth investigating (NI 5222).

Nelson and Key played together in punk bands in the late '70s until the latter went to Japan and was taken aback by Tokyo's nascent Technopolitan revolution, with bands like Yellow Magic Orchestra taking the spirit of Kraftwerk into the 21st century.

THE TRADITIONAL symbol of Christmas, the kindly old man with a merry chuckle, namely Cliff Richard, has been forsaken by a record-buying public seeking a more political Christmas message.

It was somewhere between these two factions that Madness and the 2-Tone bands appeared. 
Madness was a good-time dance band playing old ska and rocksteady numbers. 
`Fuck art &dash. let's dance" was not only one of their idioms, but possibly the best way of describing the feelings of many of these new dance <tag "532782">bands</>.   

800976
The record has a certain gloomy power, but you can't help feeling that by trying to be Bruce Mellencamp, Earle is ignoring his real strengths. 
But Earle can derive comfort from the fact that it is impossible to sink as low as Crosby Stills &and. Nash, whose Live It Up sounds like a fifth-rate Bee Gees auditioning for the job of house <tag "532736">band</> at a tacky Atlantic City slot-machine joint.

`JACQUI": Pucker up, luvva. 
Sick and tired of their `wild" reputation, it seems THE QUIREBOYS have formed a vigilante group to stamp out the more unseemly aspects of boorish male behaviour. 
Before we have time to warn him, BEN's head is rudely parted from his shoulders by OTTO, the <tag "532736">band's</> lead guitarist who, for ritual purposes, sports `alien" headgear and a huge, unwieldy occult Afro comb.

The singer was unable to complete the show at Newcastle University on October 28, which resulted in a mini-riot. 
A spokesman for the band said: `He managed the first number, but had to leave the stage, almost collapsing, halfway through the second song. 
The remaining <tag "532736-a">band</> members stayed on stage to perform a 15-minute instrumental version of `Bombay Mix", a hugh live favourite, which brought the house down &ellip. literally!"

`Frendly" was recorded last June in the wilds of Wales. 
It was played down by the <tag "532736">band</> and manager Steve Harrison, who is paranoid about being seen to `cash in", `manipulate" or any of those other snidey cracks that godhead success usually brings.

Of all the river families, none has equalled the Phelpses of Putney; and the death of Dick Phelps, Waterman to Thames Rowing Club for 35 years, leaves the sport mourning one of its best-loved figures.

The whole outside, in fact, what I could see of it, looked unusually good and deserving of similes today &dash. cleaner, sharper, more richly colored: I had removed the screens from the windows the day before, because the hot weather seemed to be gone for the year. 
Also as a result of the weather, I was wearing a sweater for the first time in months, one Patty had given me for my birthday; a brown monster stout with various fugal inversions and augmentations of the standard cable knit, and consequently glutted with insulational dead air, its corona of lighter outer fibers frizzing out three-eighths of an inch or more from the slubbed and satisfyingly clutchable weave that formed the actual structure underneath, so that the sweater, along with me, its wearer, appeared to fade without a demonstrable outer boundary into the rest of the room, as tuning forks or rubber <tag "532838">bands</> will seem in their blurred vibration to transform their material selves into the invisible sound they generate; a machine-made sweater, but manufactured apparently with Xenakian lurches and indecisions programmed into the numerically controlled needles that, unlike the chain flayings and bleaching stains used in production lines to antique new furniture, gave it to my eye an attraction distinct from the irregular grandmotherly alternations between close attention and indignant abandonment at historical preservation meetings prominent in handmade knitwear.

Much of the Tuesday concert was inevitably devoted to promoting Amandla, but the vehicle the trumpeter used to cover that light, subtle and melodically exultant record was a double trio-two percussionists, two bassists, two keyboards, with lead bassist Joseph McCreary functioning more or less as a solo guitarist. 
On record, Amandla's sophistication is based on a fizzing black street-beat, spare yet elegant themes both dancing and tender, and a highlighting of musical detail all around the <tag "532736">band</> through intelligent production controlling the prominence of the drums.

These writers and many fans were demanding a return to what they saw to be something purer and Lu Watters set out to provide it. 
In fact Watters had been playing jazz as a teenager during the so-called Golden Era of the Twenties.

That may be Morrissey ridiculing the entire music business, cheapening it even, but, in doing so, he was merely ridiculing himself. 
For all their ethics, The Smiths were as guilty as any <tag "532736">band</> in the history of popular music when talking about marketing ploys and promotional tactics.

The crowd of 870, including the pair of Sassenachs, saw Cove come within 13 minutes of forcing a replay on their own turf at Allan Park and such an outcome would have been no less than Rangers deserved. 
Of Cove's merry <tag "532735">band</> of salesmen, bankers and telephone engineers it would be difficult and unfair to single out individuals, and Dave Watson, the Rangers manager, could find nothing but praise: `I asked them to give me 100 per cent and they did not let me down.

Now the man I am talking about obviously does not find that an uncomfortable position to be in.

A man lies dead in the gardens of Rudyard and Nightingale Crescents. 
The gravel path, which was raked only this morning by residents and members of the garden committee, is disarranged at the point where it curves round to run alongside Ladbroke Grove, to the east: the hair of the dead man, brown-grey and thin, lies across it like a weed.

He was fascinated by a hybrid jazz that mixed pop, improvisation and classical borrowings into an elephantine, hyperbolic, sometimes truly adventurous music. 
Kenton hired a number of good female singers (including Anita O'Day early in the band's career) and he brought in Illinois-born Christy in 1945.

As a group develops, it slowly attains a responsibility towards the people who work for it.

The total sponsorship, believed to be about #150,000, from Leekes of Llantrisant, has made possible this new introduction to the tournament scene, which may rival even the British Open itself for quality of entry, and possibly better it for showmanship. 
It is the aim of the enterprising promoter, Robert Edwards, to use some of that money to create hype usually foreign to the squash circuit. 
That may include fashion shows between matches, piping players on with the <tag "532736">band</> of the Welsh Guards, selling dinner tables at #500 a time, and introducing celebrities to the crowd.

Rock `n" rail Some months before the troubles developed in East Germany, one of the world's more arcane organisations, the Ireland-German Democratic Friendship Society, announced plans to celebrate in Dublin the 40th birthday of their comrades' dictatorship in the East. 
A couple of bands were hired several months ago to jolly up the celebrations, whose main participants appeared to be trade unionists who had been on free holidays to one of the last proletarian paradises.

You can see from the sequence that cloud has spread over most of the region today, with just the occasional break letting the sun shine through. 
The thicker cloud out in the Atlantic will bring rain to all parts of the region tonight, but the clear skies further west will replace the cloud and rain tomorrow.

But Dylan had begun recording in Nashville as early as 1966, when he cut Blonde On Blonde there. 
He had also signalled his change of direction away from encyclopaedic, apocalyptic rock on John Wesley Harding, where songs of profound spiritual quest were capped by this hummable but slight ditty, complete with curling pedal steel guitar. 
Long Black Veil &dash. The <tag "532736-p">Band</> (Music From Big Pink, Capitol 1968) The Band weren't exactly `country rock", but they had been poking about in related areas on the Basement Tapes, which they cut informally with Dylan in 1967, and their debut album as the Band was similarly rootsy and acoustic-sounding.

The Americans' man in Zaire, President Mobutu Sese Seko, also backed by France and Belgium, is becoming a hideous embarrassment: he has impoverished his country and oppressed its people. 
In Liberia, where the United States backs the ruler and the local dollar, the Americans are at last shaking off the deplorable Mr Samuel Doe, whom they took under their wing by sheer carelessness after he killed the previous oligarchs in 1979.

Fortunately, ex-Prisoner James Taylor is aware of the problem and is finally coming to terms with it after five albums of patchy solo meanderings. 
Despite the electricity generated on parts of `The Moneyspyder" and to some extend on `Wait A Minute" (particularly the hit-that-never was, `Theme From Starsky and Hutch"), James has never quite harnessed the fury of his old <tag "532736">band</> to his all-consuming love of jazz.

The band caused a sensation on New Year's Eve, helping to produce, by all accounts, a classic evening. 
Joe Moss, however, was beginning to feel ill at ease as the rest of the band indulged in typical rock 'n' roll trappings that were at odds with Morrissey's stated philosophy. 
(The next visit to the States would intensify his annoyance and prove instrumental in his departure from the <tag "532736">band</>).

But for me and many others, old school is something that transcends fashion and has precious little to do with paying #60 in London for something that cost $5 in the backstreets of Chicago. 
It's hip hop at its birth, it's DJ Kool Hero, `Apache" by The Incredible Bongo <tag "532736-p">Band</>, subway trains with Smurfs on the side, fat laces, quick cuts and the almost mythical impression of New York at a time when black music gave birth to what remains its hardes and most vital creation.

Mr Bond and Mr Skase are two of Australia's new media barons who had swooped on assets thrown up by the Australian government's redrafting of media ownership laws.

Based around the nucleus of school-friends Sam Corry and Dan O'Neil but occasionally expanding to a quintet, the Motherwell group are another in the current spate of Caledonian combos looking to America for musical inspiration. 
While <tag "532736">bands</> like Texas go for a bottleneck twang and Gun opt for stylish heavy metal, the River Detectives look towards Nashville; playing most of their early gigs as an acoustic duo they resemble a punkier Proclaimers, gutsy and raw yet with a heartfelt passion for lyrics that have a social conscience as well as an infectious beat.   

801047
It should have been anthemic instead of light and poppy. 
I honestly believe that The Smiths, with `Panic", wasted an opportunity to subvert our beloved mainstream radio playlists. 
Nevertheless, the single would soon see the <tag "532736">band</> tumbling headfirst into yet another controversy.

MORE AND more companies are beating a path to the door of The Theatre, Chipping Norton.

During the Sixties Franco recorded and toured continually throughout the country and the continent, greatly influencing the generation of musicians who created the wonderful regional African pop styles which burgeoned in the Seventies. 
When Franco expanded his <tag "532736">band's</> name to TPOK Jazz, the new letters standing for `tout-puissant", it was no idle boast.

Not surprisingly, in their rush they were disinclined to hump mounds of electrical equipment into the west with them, and would now find themselves without so much as a guitar string to their name, were it not for the warm-hearted generosity of the British thrash metal community. 
The band came to rest in Bristol, where they are currently being housed by Shane, owner of the city's thrash record label, Manic Ears. 
Last night a benefit concert was set to take place at the Bristol Bierkeller, featuring Extreme Noise Terror, perhaps Britain's foremost thrash <tag "532736">band</>, now legendary for turning out songs which clock in at under one second.

The line-up has changed many times and has included such almost legendary rock personalities as Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck, Richie Blackmore and Keith Moon. 
In these enlightened days, the <tag "532736">band</> is not considered quite so outrageous &dash. but it still plays raucous rock 'n' roll.   

801054
The IBA also claims that its decision to opt for what on the face of it is the more purist of the non-classical applications is based on LJR's assurance that it will cover the whole range of jazz from New Orleans and swing to the avant garde, and keep the mix coming in every show rather than dividing the presentations by idiom. 
Among the runners-up who would have extensively featured jazz, both the south London based Music FM and north London's Kiss FM will now be rooting to quickly prize the extra frequencies out of the Government that the IBA declares are available. 
Music FM's Paul Boon believes that a broadcasting policy that takes in the best of rock and pop as well as jazz is the right one for London &dash. jazz being the common root of all these developments anyway &dash. and he believes that LJR's apparent intentions to move from Basie to Lou Rawls via a rhythm and blues <tag "532736">band</> in any given half hour will exasperate jazz music's traditionally sectarian fans.

But Eleanor Thorne slept. 
The soft, tight <tag "532732">band</> strapped around her arm was nevertheless a comfort, as the pointer pushing up the dial, achieving a number, was a comfort, too, for now something was being done, someone would give her treatment to ward off the attacks of death.

He was passionately interested in jazz, classical music, cinema, theatre, ecology, politics, Picasso, Wodehouse, Shaw. 
Music was Sid's first passion; he came down with jazz fever in his teens, bought a copy of Eddie Lang's Original Barre System Guitar Method and spent every evening wearing his plectrum to a nub. 
At school, in south London, he filled the back pages of his Latin notebook with drawings of dance <tag "532782">bands</> (each musician, like Sid, was playing his instrument left-handed).

But when the break came it involved first France's Philippe Louviot and then Earley, Australia's Michael Wilson and Eric Caritoux of France. 
Down the road at Saint-Mont, where <tag "532736">bands</> were playing and children singing, Louviot rejoined Earley and Co, but it was the 27-year-old Irishman, Kelly's PDM team-mate, who had the final edge into Pau.   

801062
The writers' chart in the NME gave The Smiths a fair to low hearing, concentrating, as usual, on more obscure artifacts. 
In Sounds, the final round-up of the indie singles chart gave the band's number one and two with `What Difference Does It Make" and `Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now" respectively with three other singles (if you count Sandie Shaw's little effort) in the top thirty. 
This was backed up by the famous John Peel Festive Fifty which was embarrassingly dominated by the <tag "532736">band</>. 

801063
David's vocals were all live. 
He was down the other end of the studio &dash. not in a booth because he wanted to feel the band &dash. he didn't want to wear headphones. 
It was unlike anything I'd ever done and the only way I could cancel out some of the noise was to use two identical microphones, one pointed towards David's mouth and the other towards his neck, one picking up his voice but the two were picking up the whole <tag "532736">band</> and I'd do a technical trick by putting them `out of phase" so that when they were both picking up the band, they actually cancelled out the band leaving Dave's vocal.   

801064
Hugh continued: `We had about 20 floats in the procession &dash. they were quite magnificent and big effort had gone into them." 
`The trade float first prize went to BNF Metals, their theme was best cellars and Barlcays Bank were second with `Not A Penny More Not A Penny Less"." 
`The stalls in the Market Place all did rather well and the two <tag "532736">bands</> we had playing, Big Boys Blues Band, and Subtle Satisfaction &dash. from King Alfred School, were well received, may be they are the talent for the future."

The professionals will be competing in five races each night while the supporting programme includes schoolboy motocross races. 
Doors open at noon to allow time to see the sideshows which include mountain bike events, skateboard and BMX freestyle showdowns. 
A 12-piece blues <tag "532736">band</> and 30 dancers will add to the razzmatazz, and each evening will end with a firework display.

Anne said: `Much of the money will go towards giving sick children special treats they wouldn't normally have." 
The bike show will be opened at 11am on Saturday July 21 in the field next to the Osprey, Upavon Way. 
FORMER Oxford <tag "532736">band</> Swervedriver, had to cancel last month's eagerly-awaited return to the city when singer Adam Franklin was injured in a fracas in a London nightclub.

Morrissey was simply experimenting with the many facets of media attention. 
The rest of the <tag "532736">band</> appeared perfectly content to let this happen.

CANADA'S 13 Engines, with their considered blend of ominous guitar and vocals and a sometimes lumbering, limbering beat, should have little trouble making up for lost time with this overdue European release of their excellent debut LP. 
`Before Our Time" marks out its territory with the opening `Come Back Lover", its grey, deceptively aggressive thrust very much the product of a <tag "532736">band</> born and bred across the lake from Detroit.   

801071
None thought it deserved a higher chart placing. 
It did have a most beautiful sleeve, a yellow tint vision of a young Pat Phoenix, a product of Morrissey's youthful Coronation Street obsession. 
It didn't improve the <tag "532736">band's</> pledge to give value for money.  

801072
This is, however, just the beginning. 
In no time at all the record company boys will impose their vision on the <tag "532736">band</> and how they think it should be marketed, and how fast, and to what audience, and with what producer, and what songs, and what should the press angle be?

The person guessing the correct gallons will win a large Easter egg donated by Mr Richard Northover, manager of Woolworth's store. 
Bicester Town Mayor Mr John Brown will start the firemen off to the music of Bicester Brass <tag "532744-p">Band</>.

Skating was highly organised in those days. 
A large fire of logs burnt `within an enclosure of wattled hurdles"; the `sliders" were kept at the lower end of the pond, beyond a rope, and gangs of labourers repeatedly swept away new-fallen snow or ice-chippings. 
At night the ice was `lighted with Chinese lanterns", people skated with torches and danced quadrilles to a <tag "532736">band</>, and fire balloons were sent up.

The Duke of Gloucester opens the `Palestinian Costumes" Exhibition at the Museum of Mankind, London W1.

Held on the sports field next to the village hall, the event will be opened at 2pm by Mr William Roncon of the local radio station Fox FM. 
Visitors to the fete will be able to see a display by the Hawks freefall parachute display team of the RAF Sport Parachute Association and six donkey races. 
The many other attractions will include the chance to win a ride in a hot air balloon, musical entertainment from Bletchingdon <tag "532736-p">Band</>, quad bikes and Punch and Judy.

But `Meat Is Murder" marked the end of The Smiths as we know them. 
The story continues but the band have no choice but to move into international areas. 
This DEMANDS change but if any <tag "532736">band</> can make this transformation AND keep their original sense of humility, then it is The Smiths.   

801079
I'd like to play one of them. 
When they finish, the <tag "532736">band</> pack up and fold their chairs up.

In Manchester the demand for tickets was so great that they changed hands for upwards of eighty pounds. 
The security at the Palace was so tight that even the band's ersatz manager, Scott Piering, could not gain admittance for his close acquaintances. 
The beautifully refurbished Palace was the only upwards step the <tag "532736">band</> could make after their previous Manchester appearance at the Free Trade Hall.   

801081
As it happened, the entire episode was resolved after The Smiths decided to {typo bad="repoen",good="reopen"} communications with the label and a somewhat confused Easterhouse were invited back on to the Scottish tour. 
Back in Manchester a glossy fanzine called Muze had picked up on this story and published a naively frivolous article which dared to question the somewhat confused ethical position of the <tag "532736">band</>. 

801082
The scramble for perfect vinyl ambience has forced record companies into sending their spotty new acts into the most highly sophisticated `digital" recording studios in the country. 
A producer is chosen to mould the natural sound of the <tag "532736">band</> into a new format, and the mesmerised band wander out of the studio clutching a product bearing little or no resemblance to the demo they went in with. 

801083
Newlyweds William Taylor and Deborah Raffell had their own fanfare as they left Bicester registry office on Saturday. 
The Bletchington Prize Silver <tag "532747-p">Band</> played `Congratulations" as William, 22, of Valentia Close, Bletchington, and Deborah, 20, of Jerome Way, Shipton-on-Cherwell, stepped out as a married couple. 

801084
Then, just when it seemed he should head out on his own, Hillman helped out Stephen Stills with his more patchy outfit, Manassas. 
By the time Hillman got his own Desert Rose <tag "532736-p">Band</> together three years ago he had been knocking about at the top of the music scene for two decades.

TRANSVISION VAMP Self-consciously disposable stew of stolen glam-rock riffs. 
They have quickly become an object of fascination for students of cultures with short shelf-lives, as if the <tag "532736">band</> was some kind of yoghurt.   

801086
The old fart of a Cabinet Secretary or Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster who had been boring his small, distinguished audience halfway to coma for several minutes had stopped speaking. 
He had been irreversibly shut up by one of the club servants, the most elderly of all that elderly <tag "532735">band</>.   

801087
But when she unlocked the door and called out sharply, there was no answer, the music did not stop, and when she went downstairs, it was to find the house empty. 
Yet I am hearing music, brass <tag "532744-a">band</> music and an organ, quite clearly, she said, and her own voice echoed in the quiet hall.   

801088
The Smiths were pleased. 
They, at least, felt a responsibility towards the hand-picked support <tag "532736">band</> themselves regardless of what label they hail under (strangely enough &dash. Factory).

Information from Channel Arts Association (tel: 0271 862419).

Max Atkinson failed to twig Mrs Thatcher's game. 
Her seemingly inept answers to Brian Walden's questions were not intended to impress the tiny <tag "532735">band</> of politics junkies who watch Brian Walden each week.   

801091
Basie, with a less demanding kind of music, paid lower wages and as a result there was a far greater turnover of men in his group. 
Ben Webster and Paul Gonsalves were the two great tenor saxophonists in the Ellington <tag "532736">band</>, with Harold Ashby and Al Sears only slightly less eminent.

The couple is #800 a year better off. 
It would be wise to review all investments to take full advantage of a wife's personal tax allowance and the fact she is also entitled to her own basic rate tax <tag "532734">band</>. 

801093
Their reception was middling but this was a major triumph. 
The <tag "532736">band's</> resolve increased tenfold, although Morrissey was a little stunned by the enormity of the upcoming task.   

801094
There were pubs in London which had a cliente&grave.le made up of original skinheads, whose age tended to be above 25, and at which none of the new boots and braces or plastic skins would be tolerated. 
It was somewhere between these two factions that Madness and the 2-Tone bands appeared. 
Madness was a good-time dance <tag "532782">band</> playing old ska and rocksteady numbers. 

801095
The president and members of Didcot Rotary Club wish to thank the residents of Didcot and district for their unstinting support for charitable efforts during the past Rotary Year. 
We have been able to support many local charities and good causes, including British Heart Foundation, Didcot Hospital Physio '89 appeal, Bennett House bus appeal, Didcot Social Services welfare fund, Greenmere School music festival, Didcot Diamonds marching <tag "532806">band</>, Haematology Support Group, Telethon '90, R.N.I.B., Manor Playgroup and other causes.

Lu began his career as `the most promising bugler" at the St Joseph's Military Academy in Sacramento and as trumpeter in the school's brass band. 
While at high school in 1926 when he was 15 he formed his own jazz band. 
He worked as a musician on a ship during school vacations and while at the University of San Francisco he played in a <tag "532736">band</> at the Palace Hotel. 

801097
All costs are met by volunteer effort, and the children and their parents are working hard to raise money for instruments. 
The <tag "532736">band</> is happy to play for events such as barbecues, especially where there are children involved.   

801099
Ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr worked perfectly with Johnson, adding both inspired flights of fancy and substance to the rhythms. 
Drums and bass were as solid as they come and the keyboards filled in any gaps. 
While concert performance cannot reproduce all the subtleties of a recording, the <tag "532736">band</> was drilled to precision and communicated the necessary edge with solid strength.   

801100
Full value rating too, with extra tracks the previously unreleased somewhat quaint, `Dodo" plus a demo version of `Candidate", both from '73. 
`David Live", recorded in Philadelphia, finds Bowzer tangling with his back catalogue aided by a <tag "532736">band</> of funkateers including the renowned Herbie Flowers (bass) and Earl Slick (guitar). 

801101
At the end of the 15th century the great and good King Richard IV (Brian Blessed) had two sons &dash. the noble Harry, Prince of Wales, and another one whose name is unremembered by most people (including Richard IV). 
This is Edmund, Duke of Edinburgh, alias The Black Adder, alias `the worm in the apple of England" a Royal Robin Hood with some very different ideas on economics and a <tag "532735">band</> of only two, rather miserable men, Baldrick (Tony Robinson) and Lord Percy (Tim McInnery).   

801102
The lack of expense involved complies fully with their famous refusal to produce promo videos. 
As the music business increasingly places so much importance on the look (A &and. R men no longer listen to the music first: the priority of the A &and. R man is to envisage how the <tag "532736">band</> will look on video) so The Smiths abhor such methods.

All alone in a ghastly throng, he crieth to Heaven for mercy, but finds none, and must solace himself with dull opiates. 
IT IS an ancient rocking <tag "532736">band</> (Of chords, they know but three) And they play their usual Christmas gig To crowds at Wembley.

Inspired both by the music and by the invisible angels who frequent the church, the women began to perform wild hop, skip and jump dances. 
One matron leaped up and down, with cape flying, one arm raised in the air as if in triumph. 
All the while the <tag "532736">band</> played Jingle Bells with thudding drums and soaring saxophones.

Newlyweds William Taylor and Deborah Raffell had their own fanfare as they left Bicester registry office on Saturday. 
The Bletchington Prize Silver Band played `Congratulations" as William, 22, of Valentia Close, Bletchington, and Deborah, 20, of Jerome Way, Shipton-on-Cherwell, stepped out as a married couple. 
William usually plays the euphonium in the <tag "532736-p">Band</> and his mother Karen, the secretary of the Band, plays the trumpet, cornet, euphonium and the tenor horn. 

801106
Leogang's railway station is just a short walk from the village if you like to organise your own excursions. 
At night there's a relaxed atmosphere, with cosy evenings in bars, sometimes with zither music; barbecues are arranged, and occasional concerts performed by the local <tag "532736">band</>.   

801107
The bulky American, nicknamed The Walrus because of his distinctive drooping moustache, had an eagle and nine birdies to waltz away with the #66,000 title after two near-misses. 
He was second to Sam Torrance in 1983 and again runner-up to New Zealand's Greg Turner in 1986. 
It was a performance worthy of a 21-gun salute from the King's Castle close by, and certainly merited the musical salute of the Swedish capital's brass <tag "532744">band</>, who led the victory parade round the 18th green.   

801108
Morrissey and the lads were apparently miffed that their last two singles weren't as successful as they had hoped. 
The choice of the first (`Shakespeare's Sister") and the timing of the second (`That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore"), already available on `Meat Is Murder", coupled with a lack of airplay were given as reasons for their failure. 
The fact that the <tag "532736">band</> refused to do videos and that very little TV promotion was given to these singles didn't help either. 

801109
I don't even know that he suggested any ideas. 
I think he said, `I would like a snakeskin drape coat" or something and she made that, but most of it was just some of these, some of those and what-have-you, and came up with them all. 
It wasn't a staged show but everyone moved like a <tag "532736">band</> and David just had a good time and enjoyed himself and smiled a lot.   

801110
The rest are pigshit." 
The best stories, though, are perhaps the first, about a middle-aged bachelor farming alone after his mother dies, and the last, about a member of the village brass <tag "532744">band</> picking up a woman on a bus trip to Venice.   

801111
Yes? 
Will you agree to grant three <tag "532734-a">band</> collection permits, which you've done before, which are usually great fun, I must say.

Eric also worked for the great composer/ arranger Oliver Nelson, appeared on Oliver's distinguished Afro American Sketches album, and learned much from Nelson's unique approach to music. 
After working in the pit band at Harlem's Apollo Theatre for four years, he made his first visit to Europe with drummer Curly Hamner to play in the Josephine Baker show in 1959. 
He stayed a full year in Paris, and then came back to Europe at the end of 1960 with the magnificent <tag "532736">band</> led by Quincy Jones.

The proportion of our population aged over 65 has swollen from one in twenty to one in five. 
The once tiny fringe of retired men and women has broadened to a <tag "532735">band</> of ten million.

Evening film shows are sometimes arranged. 
Free activities: Open air brass <tag "532744-a">band</> concerts are very popular and are held on a regular basis.

Oddly, because he was only a moderately talented trumpet player, Lu Watters became one of the most influential musicians in the whole of jazz. 
It was he who started the traditional jazz revival which eventually produced musicians like Chris Barber, Humphrey Lyttelton, Acker Bilk and the entire revivalist movement of the Forties and Fifties. 
At the height of the Swing era in 1938 some writers were insisting that jazz as represented by the Dixieland music of Eddie Condon and the <tag "532765-a">big</> band sounds of Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey had moved too far away from the true New Orleans music.

The CE forecasters believe exports will continue to grow because European markets are set to expand in 1990 and later owing to increased investment stimulated by the development of Eastern Europe and the single market in the European Community. 
The CE study assumes that sterling joins the European exchange rate mechanism by 1991-92 but is held within 6 per cent fluctuation <tag "532734">bands</> similar to those applying to the Italian lira.

Price bands are an important element in the second group of changes, the prime aim of which is to ensure fairness in the corporation's dealings with customers. 
The number of price bands will be increased by three to 20, and the ceiling doubled from 25 million therms a year to 50 million therms a year. 
Another <tag "532734">band</> applies to customers using more than 50 million therms a year.

I thought it would be interesting to ask him to do just that and hereby present &ellip 
THE DAVE McCULLOUCH MINI CHAPTER: `Reflections on The Smiths, a pop band. 
I think I did say, in Sounds, that they would be the last major rock <tag "532736">band</>, in the sense that they would follow, and terminate, the trend that rolls through The Who / The Stones etc, playing big stadiums on summer days to hordes of worshippers."   

801120
David's vocals were all live. 
He was down the other end of the studio &dash. not in a booth because he wanted to feel the <tag "532736">band</> &dash. he didn't want to wear headphones.

After working in the pit band at Harlem's Apollo Theatre for four years, he made his first visit to Europe with drummer Curly Hamner to play in the Josephine Baker show in 1959. 
He stayed a full year in Paris, and then came back to Europe at the end of 1960 with the magnificent band led by Quincy Jones. 
He returned to the United States with this <tag "532736">band</> and was with Quincy when he played at New York's Basin Street East with Peggy Lee and Billy Eckstine.

Come the evening, disgruntled temporary refuse collectors were being turned away at the door while the trash stash mounted to two tons. 
Cooper seems to have hit on a winning theme, but you have to hope thrash <tag "532736">band</> Carcass don't attempt the same bring-and-buy stunt.

They hated the new plastic skins. 
There were pubs in London which had a cliente&grave.le made up of original skinheads, whose age tended to be above 25, and at which none of the new boots and braces or plastic skins would be tolerated. 
It was somewhere between these two factions that Madness and the 2-Tone <tag "532736">bands</> appeared. 

801124
Even more astonishing were the intermediate figures: `It is important to realise just how phenomenally fast these are. 
First gear, for example, gives over 60mph without exceeding 6000rpm, and around the peak of the torque curve a 20mph increase takes less than 2secs. 
Corresponding times for the same <tag "532734">band</> in second take only 0.5secs or so more, and even by using third they are barely lengthened by 1sec. 

801125
Next year there is automatic separate taxation. 
`If you are made redundant before 5 April and you are normally taxed only at the basic rate, but a significant part of your compensation brings you into the higher rate band, then you could pick up a hefty tax bill," Mr Maas said. 
`If you are a basic rate taxpayer and your lump sum does not bring you into the 40 per cent tax <tag "532734">band</>, then the point is not so relevant.   

801126
However, she recovered from the excessive heat, and on August 12 it was reported that the grass plot, round which she walked twenty-two times to complete a mile, was now a beaten track like a permanent path. 
And so the marathon walk continued until it was successfully concluded on the evening of Monday, August 21, but before that ultimate triumph Miss Richards toured the city in an open brake drawn by three horses, attired in her walking costume and accompanied by a brass band, acknowledging gracefully the plaudits of those who thronged the streets. 
Later, hundreds trekked out to the little village to see the completion of the thousand-mile feat; the Islip Brass <tag "532744-p">Band</> played for dancing and an added attraction was 

801127
Good as the concert was, it was rather too middle of the road for a tour titled `The The vs The World" and, sadly for fans of the more paranoid earlier work, Johnson's attempts to darken the proceedings ended up looking silly. 
By not uttering a word to the audience, then keeping the stage shrouded in smoke, lit only from the back in lurid purple, orange and red, and reducing the <tag "532736">band</> to shadowy figures looming out of a fog, he put so much distance between them and anybody past the regulation front-of-stage pogoers that attention easily wandered.   

801128
Daltrey good-humouredly explained his penchant for buying fish farms. 
Aspel, dreading any foul-mouthed outbursts, was indeed caught short as the bleep machine was used not, alas, for Mr Harris but for some schoolboy anecdote from one of the <tag "532736">band</>, looking as washed up as the denim coat he sported. 

801129
But while Ride and TFC took the indie way out of obscurity, gaining success by giggling like hell while maintaining a strong position in Sounds' indie charts, Five Thirty bit the big one and signed to a major, East West. 
`ABSTAIN" CERTAINLY confirmed a lot of people's fears for the band's identity within corporate confines. 
Although widely regarded as an excellent `debut", it didn't really capture the <tag "532736">band's</> fiery live shows. 

801130
Therefore a group of people, made up mainly of parents, but also including Arthur Church (then school governor), the then Headmistress Miss Forshaw, and others who had no personal association but wanted to forge links with the school, formed the `Friends of Mabel Prichard". 
The main aim of the Friends was to provide funds and assistance to expand the horizons of the children in the school. 
Over the years we have had many fund-raising events, including our Summer Fete, where we have had Brass <tag "532744">Bands</>, Strawberries and Cream, and lovely summer days.

A year earlier he witnessed the Sex Pistols debacle at the Lesser Free Trade Hall, Manchester, a legendary bombastic event bludgeoned into rock history books by the Pistols' typical blind arrogance and contrived but destructive chaos. 
Steven Morrissey was impressed and compared the Pistols to his beloved New York Dolls in the New Musical Express letters page. 
`The Sex Pistols", he wrote, `are very New York and it's nice to see that the British have produced a <tag "532736">band</> capable of producing the atmosphere created by the New York Dolls and their many imitators, even though it might be too late &ellip  

801132
It seemed bizarre that a band plagued by such huge problems on an international scale should wish to waste their time attempting to sue a small time and, to be frank, penniless magazine. 
Now, Muze magazine may not have been a high profile organisation but it did provide a much needed platform for the flourishing Manchester rock scene. 
To see this platform threatened by a mere Smiths' power game, hardly proved good PR for the <tag "532736">band</> and a degree of bad feeling began to boil away in their home city. 

801133
Music was Sid's first passion; he came down with jazz fever in his teens, bought a copy of Eddie Lang's Original Barre System Guitar Method and spent every evening wearing his plectrum to a nub. 
At school, in south London, he filled the back pages of his Latin notebook with drawings of dance bands (each musician, like Sid, was playing his instrument left-handed). 
At 15, he left school, joined a <tag "532736">band</> and went on tour in a revue in which another Sid, Field by name, graduated from straight man to comic.

Party night: This is an extremely happy night, hosted by the Mayrhofen Trio who are well known all over the world; in fact, they represented Austria at the Olympic Games.

The cost of this will be shared between the Vale and the Exchequer at a varying rate of percentages. 
Uniformed youth organisations such as the Scouts and Guides fall into this category, but the total exemption will also apply to such groups as the Abbey Brass <tag "532744-p">Band</> which, although not registered as a charity, has to maintain a practice hut in the Abbey Meadow in Abingdon.

After all, the album's for you. 
The New Kids are also hoping that this album will prove to critics that they are more than just another cute <tag "532736">band</>.

Not that the music is new. 
From the French word secouer, `to shake", soukous is a dance that arose out of the nightclubs of Kinshasa, the capital of Zaire, in the mid-Sixties. 
The music was a development of the Zairean rumba, a complex dance arrangement shaped by Zaire's two great artists, Franco (who sadly died on 12 October) with his <tag "532736">band</> Tout Puissant OK Jazz, and Tabu Ley, with African Fiesta Jazz.

Not Vinnie (as he insists his name be spelt), Batty and the boys, but the multitudinous members of Sportchestra, whose extraordinary double-LP 101 Songs About Sport (Agit Prop Records) is currently vying for Christmas sales with Kylie (or Kyly as she would be known at Elland Road) and Jason. 
The gatefold sleeve (right) does not show the <tag "532736">band</> &dash. many on loan from groups like Thatcher On Acid, Heresey, Mekons and Membranes &dash. but one can safely assume there is not a kipper tie in sight.

The music was two-beat and very loud. 
`It certainly is funny to hear those youngsters trying to play like old men," was trumpeter Bobby Hackett's comment on the <tag "532736">band</>. 

801140
He's also completely charismatic. 
Cooking up the music with Tony is guitarist Gordon King, a lank, skinny bop of a man, and confirmed trash freak. 
Of undetermined role is Julia M Seashells, a two-legged mermaid who presides over Tony with a verbal rolling in: Andy Hobson, who plays keyboards but is worn out from his other job of writing false accounts of Stockport County in the local paper; and the slides and video man Adge, who's responsible for the <tag "532736">band's</> cool stage set which makes watching World Of Twist like peering into a late-'60s trash prog.   

801141
How can that be a bad thing. 
Also they are the best <tag "532736">band</> in the world."

When very successful footballers, cricketers, boxers, golfers, even amateur rugby players like Bill Beaumont and Gareth Edwards, retired from their sport they might hope to cash in somehow. 
They could perhaps join the growing <tag "532735">band</> of pundits.   

801143
We were indeed. 
Stepping onto the platform, attached like the others to a link on the chatelaine, I was given a cheese sandwich, compliments of the council. 
The town <tag "532736">band</> played a selection from `The Merry Wives of Windsor" while we waited for the Billeting Officer.

MANCHESTER parents are alarmed that the introduction of the Poll Tax could put an end to the city's highly-esteemed Music Education Service. 
For 17 years, the MES has provided general music tuition at every level to 12,000 young people each week, fostering new talent for the Manchester's many orchestras, choirs and <tag "532736">bands</>.

`It's Love", for example, glides on harmonies huger and more beautiful than anything on Brian Wilson's comeback album. 
King's X are very much a cult <tag "532736">band</> at present, but `It's Love" and `I'll Never Get Tired Of You" are potential smash hits.   

801147
Suddenly inspiration had to come from an extremely private lifestyle, the classic Catch 22 of socialist rock and roll. 
Just as the scathing desperation of a <tag "532736">band's</> early days helps fuel the sentiment and connect with an audience in a similar position, then a band's later lifestyle has no connection with the audience who, quite naturally, don't give a damn about the problems of being pop stars.   

801148
In addition to a rapidly expanding catalogue of classy singles ('Real Gone Kid', `Wages Day", `Fergus Sings The Blues") all culled from their Number One album, When The World Knows Your Name, they aired a surprisingly canny selection of covers &dash. a raunchy Beatles B-side, `I'm Down", Bacharach and David's melting `I'll Never Fall In Love Again', Randy Newman's anti- American `Sail Away", and finally ended a two-and-a-half-hour stint with a rocking version of Darlene Love's Phil Spector number `Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)".

In the everyday world of colour signalling, responses are conditioned to a few popular hues: red, yellow, blue, green, black, white, purple and, perhaps, orange.

THE DREAM TEAM A thin, vaguely patronising comedy about four basket cases from a mental institution who are stranded alone in New York. 
It's a slightly indulgent star vehicle for Michael Keaton, who plays the swaggering psychotic in charge of the <tag "532736">band</>, and has nothing much of interest to say about mental illness, but there are some compensations in the trio of pleasing supporting performances. 

801156
He even sounds like that on old pop tunes like Secret Love, imparting to them an ironic, cantankerous quality straight from the sassiest of blues. 
It was that combination of jazz literacy and earthiness that endeared Scofield to Miles Davis. 
Scofield, after years of banging out funk with his own <tag "532736">bands</> (his records would bear refreshingly unequivocal titles like Loud Music), comes to Britain with a trio, and a return to jazzier improvising and more orthodox tunes.

The entrance was well-endowed with bouncers who told me to leave my camera in the cloakroom. 
The camera would not have worked inside in any case, as it was almost pitch dark, but as our eyes grew accustomed to the level of light, I was able to make out an extravagant, late-Forties decor, with lots of leaning lamp-posts and tiny bulbs glinting through holes in painted plywood. 
The floor was packed with couples, while the <tag "532736">band</> on the podium smashed out a spirited version of the `Sheikh of Araby".

THE Queen welcomed President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia to Britain today with a broad smile, a handshake and a ceremonial Guard of Honour at Buckingham Palace. 
The jailed playwright turned politician, on a three-day official visit, gave a brief bow each to the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh and then, after the handshakes wiped his hand nervously on his jacket. 
The <tag "532736">band</> of the Scots Guards played the Czech national anthem in a welcome on the same scale as that given to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev last April.

BRITAIN may be on the verge of a manufacturing renaissance in the coming decade but it could be undermined by full membership of the European Monetary System, two leading forecasting firms predict today.

The result was a superbly percussive style which could also be tender and thoughtful. 
Hampton has always been a deeply rhythmical player: so much so that his big bands have been criticised for espousing rhythm-and-blues, even though they included such great names as Clifford Brown, Charlie Mingus and Quincy Jones. 
Benny Goodman's big <tag "532765">band</> became famous as epitomising the `swing" of the thirties.

She got Kenton to listen to her when she knew of Anita O'Day's imminent departure, and impressed the band leader with her husky, intimate way of working &dash. though O'Day's style still dominated. 
Kenton helped her find her own sound, which perfectly suited the cool and restrained jazz voicings that were to come in the late 1940s. 
A mixture of restraint and playful vivacity (she was dubbed `the misty Miss Christy") she developed the self-confidence to rise above the tumult of Kenton's music, and was at home with both ballads and the Latin-flavoured pieces that the <tag "532736">band</> favoured &dash. notably Tampico which was a huge commercial success.

Higher Japanese interest rates and the prospect of even lower American rates have heightened expectations that the dollar may weaken further when full-scale trading resumes next week.

801174
French racecourses, without bookmakers and with an undemonstrative crowd that tend to think of horses in terms of their number on the Pari-Mutuel rather than their name, can seem strange places to Britons. 
Phoenix Park, at the top end of the biggest park in any European city, is altogether more atmospheric, with Tudor-style buildings, bookmakers who are just as happy to take and pay out in sterling as in punts, and <tag "532736">bands</> and clowns to provide extra entertainment.  

801175
Starting off with a gentle accordion waltz, just to confuse the unsuspecting, they head off into a selection that mixes Algerian rai, and the other ethnic noises of the French cultural melting pot, with a dash of Gypsy Kings flamenco (but given a declamatory, Pogues-style once-over) and ballads that reflect the French music hall and chanson tradition &dash. but with a hilarious, surreal and often absurdly serious line in (French) lyrics added. 
The <tag "532736">band</> got together in Paris, but come from all over the country, where they've worked as fishermen, punk musicians, or employees of a horse circus.

801180
The Who's still athletic and mesmerising show gives a good indication why. 
Townshend may have nearly found a more tragic end than his operatic hero when he almost crucified himself as his famous windmill action ended with part of his guitar going through his hand recently, and Roger Daltrey, the lead singer, may have literally taken an early bath when he deserted the <tag "532736">band</> towards the end of a sell-out concert at Wembley last week because his voice was going, but such mishaps are rare signs of encroaching middle age.

RIGHT NOW, Five Thirty are as enthusiastic as ever. 
Tara, with his lumberjack shirt and messy hair than hangs irritatingly over his right eye; Paul with his pudding bowl cut and lightly flared jeans (their sole acknowledgement of prevailing fashion trends) and Phil with his goofy grin and ramshackle cut. 
Together they've got the attitude that comes with being a young band who've just spent the last month in the studio recording an album, tentatively called `Revelation/s", which will more than fulfil the potential they displayed earlier this year when &dash. along with the likes of near neighbours Ride (both originally come from Oxford) and Teenage Fanclub &dash. they were seen as the frontrunners of the rising young guitar <tag "532736">bands</>.

The bell would spend the night of Thursday to Friday in the stable yard. 
On Friday morning shortly before seven o'clock, the time at which postulants were customarily admitted to the Abbey, the bell would be the centre of a little country festival, whose details had been lovingly designed by Mrs Mark, during which it would be danced to by the local Morris, serenaded by a recorder <tag "532736">band</> from the village school, and sung in solemn procession across the causeway by the choir from the local church, who had for some time now been studying ambitious pieces in its honour, one indeed composed for the occasion by the choirmaster.

JOHANNESBURG &dash. Adding a sinister dimension to the term `white wedding", a blond, blue-eyed couple was married on Pretoria's death row yesterday, celebrating a bond of hatred for black people, writes John Carlin.

This is very much in the Vega / Suicide tradition: in 1978 when Suicide supported The Clash on their UK tour, there were incredible scenes of carnage as the <tag "532736">band</> were attacked by meathead Clash fans with bottles and fireworks.   

801228
But, more importantly, a Smiths gig is merely part of a night out, something to talk about in the pub afterwards. 
Good as the <tag "532736">band</> may well be, they can't escape the fact that huge gigs are not the most enjoyable of experiences.   

801229
Fortunately fame hasn't changed Victor Tsoy much he's still a silent loner. 
His <tag "532736">band</> play only once a month, although they're offered 15,000 roubles per night.   

801230
`When someone wants writing or programming, I can offer them that. 
Tapes for touring <tag "532736">bands</>, jingles for adverts, programs for drum machines." 

801231
They had to lie about my age to get me in, because I was small then. 
I was always interested in the melodic side of music and I started playing bugle rather than drums, and I stayed in that band until I was about 16." 
Despite the lure of the bugle it was the saxophone players that he saw in the street <tag "532736">bands</> that drew him, and when he was only 12 he persuaded his mother to buy him a tenor saxophone.

The Tommies marching to the station. 
The <tag "532736">band</>. 

801233
`We were both disappointed but no-one was to blame for the misunderstanding." 
William's mum, Mrs Karen Taylor, the <tag "532736">band's</> secretary, who also plays the trumpet, cornet, euphonium and tenor horn, said: `I am just happy that they are together &dash. it was only a slip-up over a piece of paper and did not really spoil our day."   

801234
(Not necessarily a good thing as McCullouch, esoteric as always, often attached a McCullouch stigma to his favoured acts. 
The phrase `A Dave McCullouch <tag "532736">band</>" was often used to describe those whose musical wanderings took them into the world of personal art ethics and therefore obscurity.)   

801235
Confiscation was just a natural step after that. 
By affecting to protest the move to such a mansion, Chay demonstrated his essential humility and escaped from his mother's cooking in one deft stroke. 
At last, he gave in to the public's will and moved into the new residence which carried an evaluation of $13,378,062.27, made possible by the sincere generosity of a few close friends; a freely given gift from a loyal <tag "532735">band</> of dear friends (General Dynamics, Big Oil, the Teamsters, Lockheed, the American Medical Association, Martin-Marietta, the Used Car Dealers of America and the schoolchildren of Dixon, Illinois); all entirely anonymously, calling themselves `The Friends of a Simple Soldier", a non-profit organisation which had been incorporated in the Cayman Islands.

If you enjoy singing, the `Sing Mit" group will teach you some of the traditional Tyrolean songs. 
There is a special activity programme geared towards senior citizens, and children will enjoy the weekly Punch and Judy shows. 
The Mayrhofen Brass <tag "532744-p">Band</> gives regular open-air concerts in fine weather. 

801237
Franco was a performer of great magnetism and of striking stature. 
Those who attended his only British performance at the Hammersmith Palais in 1984 recall the instant energy boost to the music when the massive blazer-draped bulk of Franco joined the <tag "532736">band</> on stage, having spent the warm-up numbers being photographed upstairs with a succession of London African notables.   

801238
The canal had been covered in the nineteenth century in an attempt to ease road traffic. 
In the days we were in Paris, the tabloid press was full of lurid stories of how a <tag "532735">band</> of cannibals had been discovered living in the darkness of the tunnel, but there was no evidence of any life at all, with the exception of a few rats on the towpath.   

801239
Respectable people stampeded out of the closet; the snappy- looking discs were so far removed from the cumbersome vinyl albums they had coveted as `kids" that rock music was suddenly socially acceptable. 
This cultural shift began to manifest itself beyond CD sales with the mushrooming number of `resurrection" tours. 
<tag "532736">Bands</> that had been split up for years reformed and started filling stadium-sized venues &dash. The Who, Ten Years After, Little Feat and so on.   

801240
This is how Jonathan Coe's new novel The Dwarves of Death (Fourth Estate, #12.95) got its name: `The title came from a headline in the News of The World, a story about midget matadors in Spain. 
I thought it was a great phrase." 
The novel features, amongst other things, an obscure Glaswegian punk <tag "532736">band</>, though Coe hardly looks like a punk survivor.  

801241
Brand has 2 discos to choose from. 
There is modern and traditional live music played most nights and Brass <tag "532744-a">Band</> concerts weekly.   

801242
Everyone wanted to know one thing. 
Who was this strange flower waving fellow and what could the band possibly sound like? 
That bastion of the up and coming English <tag "532736">band</>, The John Peel Show, gave a welcome airing for the inquisitive hundreds.   

801243
For months now, Sixties casualties in Los Angeles have been pinching themselves. 
Veterans of the Sunset Strip scene did a double-take when the Whiskey A-Go-Go &dash. where The Doors once played as the in-house <tag "532736">band</> for $500 a week &dash. was restored to its Day-Glo glory after a decade of black paint and chrome fixtures.   

801244
The UN High Commission, which arranges the voluntary return programme, says that more than 1,000 of Hong Kong's 57,000 boat people want to go home. 
SHOTS in the dark from snipers armed with infra-red sights, gunfire at moving cars and armed <tag "532735">bands</> roving the countryside were becoming a way of life in Romania yesterday as the remnants of the dreaded Securitate police were driven underground.   

801245
Interestingly, the body is based in Bonn and is not a hangover from the days of the Honnecker regime in East Germany. 
In a statement to Vinyl Solution, the <tag "532736">band's</> record company, the committee said that the record sleeve, which features a head with a knife sticking out of it, was unsuitable for sale in German record shops.   

801246
With the five-part writing predominant in the Missa, this would suggest a choir of 15 to 20, the size favoured by most `authentic" performances, including those by John Eliot Gardiner (15) and Philippe Herreweghe (21). 
And what a good sound the Monteverdi Choir and the Collegium Vocale make: clear, disciplined, lithe. 
Joshua Rifkin's 1982 recording proved even more of a shock from those brought up on <tag "532765-a">big-band</> Bach.   

801247
The lonely hunter of Moscow rock, often misunderstood but indifferent to public opinion. 
A fan of Arthur Rimbaud and The Velvet Underground, his <tag "532736">band</> The Centre are responsible for some of the best rock produced in the Soviet Union, and also for introducing Moscow to punk and new wave music.   

801248
And, of course, we all set our videos to record the much hyped South Bank Show special on The Smiths. 
We expected it to somehow embrace the undisputed magic of the <tag "532736">band</>.   

801249
He's getting the financial backing now to make the sort of records he's `always wanted to" &dash. produced to a 1990s sharpness, slightly more melodic than before and, naturally, with plenty of scope to join in. 
According to collaborator and <tag "532736-a">band</> leader Mark Pearson: `He constructs songs rather than writes them &dash. I play the riffs and he'll stop me and say `Hang on we need a bit in there where I go Oi] and raise my fist."   

801250
If our flotilla engineer can't fix it, our base workshops have their own stores, manned by skilled staff ready to back him up. 
If a yacht on flotilla breaks down and cannot travel due to a major failure which is not your fault, and a substitute is not available, we pay for each 24 hrs or each full sailing day (1000 to 1700) the yacht is immobile. 
There are a few conditions; you must have been sailing within the area or <tag "532734">bands</> briefed by the flotilla skipper, timing starts when the lead boat acknowledges the failure, and you must return to UK with a report signed by the flotilla skipper detailing the circumstances.   

801251
It is directed flabbily by Howard Zieff, who pads the story out with a subplot about police corruption and even then can't make it last the distance. 
The Dream Team is a slightly indulgent star vehicle for Michael Keaton, playing the swaggering psychotic in charge of the <tag "532736">band</> &dash. a milder, more acceptable edition of Randle P McMurphy in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. 

801252
`It's hard to get serious content into lyrics without sounding pretentious," he said. 
`Morrison managed it, but there's few <tag "532736">bands</> around today that do.   

801253
Their reappearance at the Town &and. Country in London generated much excitement, pulling in hundreds of pleasant-looking couples, who had consciously dressed down for the nostalgia of it &dash. much as the band themselves had. 
No pyrotechnics or flashy costumes here, just a couple of very erratic spotlights and a line-up of ropy shirts. 
The <tag "532736">band</> appears to have reformed as a two-piece: Jools Holland and the rest of them. 

801254
In the exercise room, an aerobics session was in progress, to be followed by rock and roll dancing. 
In the other room, a Swiss boy and a German girl were making an impressive model chalet from a kit they'd found in the hobbies cupboard. 
The next day, Sunday, was glorious and parents and children filled the squares of the nearby towns, listening to the traditional Sunday-morning performances of the village <tag "532736">bands</>. 

801255
Dennis was used on the latter sessions of `Young Americans when Andy Newmark and Willie Weeks had to go to other engagements. 
We again had a very unusual <tag "532736">band</>, including a guy on piano who was really big around The Beatles time in the 60s and lived in Hamburg.   

801256
`Enough beans here to blow up all of Aldgate," says the Rev Malcolm Johnson, who in 15 years has seen the numbers of homeless more than double. 
`It really makes me angry that the church has to fill the gap left by the governemnt and the local authority." 
THE <tag "532765-a">BIG</> band singers of the 1930s and 1940s, though they received a good deal of commercial encouragement, had a hard time convincing their fellow instrumentalists. 

801257
Considering this, the explosion of the most minor points, it isn't difficult to understand why a seemingly pointless paranoia affects the band's every discourse. 
But, if they can't break the star system, if it is impossible for a band of this stature to remain an `ordinary existence" (although it must be stated that New Order deliberately unglamourise their existence, wisely slowing down their schedules and viciously guarding their faceless media presence. 
New Order sell tremendous amounts of records and walk free among the streets of Manchester) then wouldn't it be possible for the <tag "532736">band</> to break rock'n'roll traditions by providing alternatives to the old rock show format?   

801258
Forty pupils from 2nd to 6th formers will take to the stage to perform the famous piece about the First World War featuring ironic comedy, pathos and popular songs from the period such as `Hitchy Koo" and `Hold Your Hand Out You Naughty Boy". 
It looks at the funny side of the war but explores its great tragedy too. 
The music is played by an eight piece <tag "532736">band</> made up mostly of pupils from both schools on flutes, clarinet, cornet and double bass, with St Birinus' head of performing arts, Andrew Walker &dash. who is the show's musical director &dash. and history head Peter Brown taking position as pianists.   

801259
Despite the usual chilling wind brushing the pits at Silverstone, the liquorice allsorts of cars preparing to race suggest this is no ordinary gathering. 
The ear-splitting roar of a Jaguar racer dies instantly, to be answered, like a cheeky echo, by the yelping of an impish Suzuki 1300 GTi. 
The <tag "532736">band</> of yellow tape across its headlights and the small sticker stating that the car has passed track inspection does little to transform it into a mean machine. 

801260
They were paid for with #400 raised by carol singing last Christmas. 
The band decided to buy them because one of their members, Mrs Jean Lidbury of West Hanney, benefitted from a similar machine after injuring her back in a road accident. 
These young members of the <tag "532736">band</> went along to the hospital on Tuesday to entertain patients and to make the presentation.   

801261
THE VACUUM IN THE BOTTLE had gotten powerful enough now to be interfering with the further delivery of milk, so I gently pulled its nipple from the Bug's mouth. 
With her eyes closed, she struggled to prevent this detachment, lifting her head a little way off my arm, but as soon as the tip of her tongue parted from the nipple's crosshatch, breaking the seal, and air seethed in rapidly, she smiled a big loopy smile, like a rubber <tag "532838">band</> in mid-flight, at the unexpectedly reciprocal respiration.   

801262
With its large car park there is enough room for both cars and coaches and with its separate restaurant area, is able to offer room for all the family. 
Mid-Oxon Brass (Children's <tag "532744-p">Band</>) held a jumble sale on February 17 in the village hall, and a car wash on March 3 on the village hall forecourt.  

801263
Coventry four-piece the Ludicrous Lollipops compete in the same arena as Ned's Atomic Dustbin but do so with a large amount of panache and with fingers firmly placed on a bouncing, glistening pop pulse. 
As their orange balloons float around the Bull And Gate, popping in time with the music, the Lollies inject heart and soul into songs like `Your Sun" and `Disinheritance" while their enthusiastic following cavort wildly. 
Debut single `Mindgames" sees the <tag "532736">band</> synchronised pirouetting, but their set is over far too quickly.   

801264
The band have recorded `Just Like tom Thumb's Blues" for Imaginary's Bob Dylan compilation. 
WORLD OF TWIST release their debut single, `The Storm", on Circa Records next week. 
Already tipped as the next major <tag "532736">band</> to emerge from the North West, they play Cambridge Junction on November 26. 

801265
The whole effect is dreamlike &dash. sometimes nightmarish. 
We return to near-normality with Rooart Presents (Rooart by Phonogram, 8328 924-1), a mini-LP of six tracks by six Australian <tag "532736">bands</> which are so normal that originality is in short supply.   

801266
The all important hip-consciousness of Manchester wholeheartedly jerked to the harsh snap of the Linn Drum. 
The Smiths, with their traditional bass / drums / guitar set up, were in grave danger of sounding out-moded while still in the embryonic stage. 
There seemed little point in worrying; the 12-string guitar work of Johnny Marr was to play a crucial part in the <tag "532736">band's</> make up.   

801267
Free activities: A selection of walks are organised by the local tourist office. 
There are also open air brass <tag "532744-a">band</> concerts.   

801268
The songs are mostly culled from the early Seventies, a time of confidence and expansion in the reggae scene which saw great innovations &dash. dub and toasting &dash. and the emergence of fine original songwriters gradually replacing the genre's reliance on remodelled American R'n'B, soul and pop. 
One or two tracks here, such as the Al Brown / Skin, Flesh &and. Bones <tag "532736-p">Band</> reggae translation of Al Green's `Here I am (Come And Take Me)", betray their provenance openly, but for most it remains as flirtatiously familiar snatches of melody slipping ghost-like through an otherwise original song, a form of borrowing that pre-dates sampling by two or three decades.   

801269
He attended Turk Murphy's sixty-fifth-birthday celebrations in December 1980, and that seems to have been his last appearance in public. 
However his music survives, most notably in the recreation of his recreation by the Merseysippy Jazz <tag "532736-p">Band</>, formed to play Watters music in 1948 and still, with most of the original band members still there, playing it today.   

801270
14 December, 1791 JOSEPH HAYDN in London records in his notebooks: `On this day I dined for the first time at the house of Mr Shaw. 
He received me below stairs at the door, and conducted me thence to his wife, who was surrounded by her two daughters and other ladies. 
While I was bowing all around I suddenly perceived that the lady of the house, besides her daughters and other ladies, wore on their headdresses a pearl-coloured <tag "532733 or 532732">band</>, of three-fingers" breadth, embroidered in gold with the name of Haydn, and Mr Shaw wore the name on the two ends of his collar in the finest steel beads. 

801271
Activity was nothing less than frenetic in these months during the overlap between filming Chinatown seeing The Last Detail come to its New York premie&grave.re in January 1974, and holding never-ending talks with a small queue of other directors and producers knocking at his front door. 
The telephone never stopped ringing, as anyone who called at the house would verify, and there were often many at the house who could, because the doors were always open to his select but not small <tag "532735">band</> of friends for whom, in his spare moments, he liked to arrange things.   

801272
Under the heading `Covent Garden Will Be Taken for a Ride", the Evening News reported that `two Rolls Royces (vintage 1920), studded with `jewels" and upholstered in leopard-skin, will be wheeled on to the stage &ellip 
London's sedate opera house will resound to jungle rhythm, cakewalk and <tag "532736-a">band</> music, and dancers will wear the shapeless fashions of 1920. 

801273
A stunning collection of freedom songs put together with the help of the Neville Brothers. 
The 1982 song Libete by the Magnum <tag "532736-p">Band</> is the highlight &dash. a brilliant dance track. 

801275
Kenton hired a number of good female singers (including Anita O'Day early in the band's career) and he brought in Illinois-born Christy in 1945. 
Christy, originally Shirley Luster, then Sharon Lesley, had already worked with the Boyd Raeburn Band. 
She got Kenton to listen to her when she knew of Anita O'Day's imminent departure, and impressed the <tag "532736-a">band</> leader with her husky, intimate way of working &dash. though O'Day's style still dominated. 

801276
Movements in time tend to become ragged coalitions in disguise, denying voters the chance to make clear choices. 
In Hungary the issue is whether stable governments can be formed from the wide <tag "533495-m or 532734">band</> of parties produced by a complex electoral system.   

801277
This time they are at the Oxford Venue in Cowley Road.

`I am told it did by the people who found it, but I can't really find out."

I am looking to develop a television programme about women and their attitude and relationship with cars. 
I am interested in hearing from women about their fascination and horror with cars, especially women in the Yorkshire region. 
On Tuesday Feb 12 there will be a benefit to raise money for the 1991 women's Delegation to Belfast and Derry featuring women's <tag "532736">bands</>, Irish music, food, videos etc.

And she was said to be taken by Mr Mandela's `gentlemanly nature". 
THE MANAGEMENT team which launched Bros and The Pet Shop Boys on the road to fame is hoping to do the same with an Oxford-based <tag "532736">band</>.   

801281
`I Started Something I Couldn't Finish" was a cute and solid pop song with Morrissey growling determinedly in comical self-analysis. 
`Typical me, typical me, typical me," he mused, as typically, all around him, the <tag "532736">band</> were beginning to crumble.   

801282
But the Anyways are full of admiration for the likes of Ride, who have leap-frogged over them in the race for a record deal. 
They hope the success of the Oxfordshire band, who topped the independent charts with their first EP, will attract record labels to take a closer look at other bands in the area. 
`There are tons of talented <tag "532736">bands</> in Oxford who could do well with a bit of exposure," said Richard. 

801283
`I like the eclecticism of some of that studio stuff," admits Tara speaking in his young, snotty Jagger voice. 
`The idea of nicking a Stones riff and putting it behind a James Brown backbeat and howling over the top is pretty appealing, but it's not really what we're into as a <tag "532736">band</>."   

801284
Perhaps the reason Zeppelin were so despised after the punk revolution was the fact that they were the ultimate muso band. 
It's ironic that you should still make excuses for the fact that the band can play really well, yet there's nothing here that can't be appreciated on the level of a blues number. 
In retrospect, it now seems odd that they were considered the ultimate heavy metal <tag "532736">band</>. 

801285
LONDON TOWN's biggest maverick, Cari, the man after whom the band is modestly named, seems to have finally found his pointy toed feet. 
Last seen fronting the spasmodically brilliant but ill-fated Riff Raff, tonight he casts the ghosts aside to prove once and for all the capital has an answer to Iggy Pop and Lux Interior all rolled into one. 
`Look at you all, you Quireboys faggots," is his opening taunt, before the <tag "532736">band</> detonate the opening `Decoy Boy", a lean, ragged, snarled up song that perfectly encapsulates their attitude.   

801287
Finely-ground obsidian was used as a medicament, and when spread on  wounds or sores was supposed to heal them quickly. 
Flat, polished slabs of obsidian were used as mirrors by artists in  different kinds of inlay work. 
One of the most striking and bizarre  exhibits in the famous Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City is an  elaborate mask, made from a human skull, completely plated with small  squares of obsidian, except for <tag "532733">bands</> of turquoise around the forehead  and mouth. 

801288
He said: `Some of the Kylie Minogue records are actually very  cleverly constructed, well put together. 
When you listen to one  of the rather better Kylie records, they have taken a girl who  doesn't really have a great voice, who is an actress, and slowly  they have developed a career where she actually now has a sound  which is similar to some of the girly groups in the 60's, in a  totally different way. 
`A lot of people would never deny the Shangri-Las, a great <tag "532736">band</>  produced by Shadow Morton, were fake girl singers going along  with the producer's ideas."   

801289
All it does is set back community relations by a couple of years." 
Requests from priests and the SDLP MP Mr Seamus Mallon for the parade to be cancelled led to the route being altered to avoid a Catholic housing estate, and permitting the main body of over 150 pipe, accordion and drum <tag "532736">bands</> to parade only once in the main street. 

801290
A news snippet in Sounds seemed to put the situation succinctly into perspective: 
`The Smiths, despite inaccurate rumours by one music paper last week, are not leaving Rough Trade &dash. for the time being at least. 
The stormy relationship with the label has once again been calmed and the <tag "532736">band</> begin recording their fourth album, and a new single, due for release in 1985, this week.

The Wantage students will now have their debating skills put to the test once more when they take part in the final on May 1 in the medical school lecture theatre at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford. 
Wantage Silver Band's annual dance will take place on Friday at the Civic Hall in Wantage. 
Tickets, which are available from Wessex Press in Wantage and Brett's Chemist in Grove, cost #3.50 and include a buffet and dancing to the Colin Taylor <tag "532765-p">Big</> Band.

Memphis In The Meantime casts a somewhat sly glance at his home town's tendency towards bland inbreeding, and kicks like a distempered mule. 
You Ain't Going Nowhere &dash. Nitty Gritty Dirt Band (Will The Circle Be Unbroken Vol2, MCA 1989) Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman reprise a Dylan song they made famous with the Byrds, as the Dirt Band bring the relationship between rock and country up to date. 
Hillman has recently been enjoying sustained success on the country charts with his country-rock unit, the Desert Rose <tag "532736-p">Band</>.

C. S. Lewis the popular Christian apologist, who was reaching so many readers in Europe and the United States, was a phenomenon who had a life of his own in the minds of the reading public. 
His friends did know that this activity had generated an enormous <tag "532735">band</> of admirers and enquirers, who wrote to Lewis from every corner of the globe and could be sure of getting a written reply.

Maggie, Natasha and the rest of the girls went into the hall together and immediately Moira was asked to dance. 
The <tag "532736">band</>, dressed in evening wear and sitting on a raised dais, were at the far end of the hall.

Mick McCarthy has pulled out of the Republic of Ireland squad to play Malta on 15 November. 
The Olympique Lyon defender requires an operation on an injured knee. 
ALL-WEATHER racing, launched in Britain 10 days ago, was given a cold shoulder by punters at Southwell yesterday when a dwindling <tag "532735">band</> of bookmakers took so few bets on one of the day's main races that no starting prices were returned for it.   

801300
His contacts in North America were not wasted, however. 
High-powered sports cars, designed by Jaguar and Porsche, for example, often use components derived from the aerospace industry and Mr Goodridge was able to obtain such parts from the US and Canada for his growing <tag "532735">band</> of European customers.

The second is never to leave on the floor a cased loop of wire or string. 
A closed loop that someone can catch their foot in and trip is one of the most frequent causes of industrial accidents. 
In Covent Garden Market every <tag "532732">band</> from every box of fruit, vegetables and flowers is cut.

He had assumed that so famous and distinguished a professor would have been given the best possible medical attention; it was the sort of assumption young men make. 
Here, suspended from Lewis's person, were pieces of tubing held on by rubber <tag "532838">bands</>, an old wooden peg, a bit of cork.

Appropriately Bill had begun his career in Defiance, Ohio. 
He led a band called the Ohio Lucky Seven in the early Twenties and on one occasion in 1924 played opposite Bix Beiderbecke and the Wolverines. 
A photo of the <tag "532736">band</> shows Bill sitting in typical pose, the bell of his cornet on one knee and his hair parted down the middle.

Mr Hyslop was also closely involved in the work of the Oxford Round Table of Religion and the Quakers. 
PEOPLE queued to climb up the tower at St Matthews Church, Harwell when parishioners celebrated the 400th anniversary of the casting of the fourth bell with an a day of fun events including a garden fete. 
The fete was a huge success with many stalls and side-shows, a brass <tag "532744">band</> and a giant birthday cake.

I arrived at the festival as the lunchtime session was drawing to a close. 
The traditional Greek <tag "532736">band</> welcomed my arrival with a flourish of quarter-tones as there was nobody else in a fit state to pay them any attention.  

801307
The young, racially-mixed crowd of 50,000 self-styled `comrades" chanted the catchy campaign hymn that promised `my first vote will make our star shine". 
Most militants wore PT stickers, buttons or shirts. 
Catching the carnival atmosphere induced by rock <tag "532736">bands</>, the crowd roared applause for a 10-year-old orator who urged the workers to rise up against the power system.

As well as tennis, other recreations include riding, golf and squash. 
There are many interesting old buildings to explore, including the local museum and the 14th century Liebfrauenkirche. 
The town's `Ooompah" <tag "532736">band</>, dressed in traditional costumes, gives regular concerts, and the well known `Hauser" group will delight you with their noisy Schuhplatter dances, singing and yodelling.

Mick Green has always wanted to own and play an accordion since he was a lad of l2. 
He has been a drummer/percussionist with local <tag "532736">bands</> for years but only recently was able to buy an accordion.

At about the same time the mail order firm, Frederick's of Hollywood, began offering elaborate contrivances by which the perfect pneumatic figure could be achieved: `blow yourself up to your favourite size" bras, girdles with cut-outs at the buttocks to let the bottom wobble, tightly-laced corsets and leg-pads (`Lovlilegs") to correct skinny calves. 
`Still going strong, it represents either the fantasy world of the tired provincial housewife, or the more dubious arena of the fetishist male, a market which is also catered for in the small ads of today's papers," wrote Aileen Ribeiro in her book, Dress and Morality. 
One of the most popular innovations in the Sixties was the `no-bra bra" designed by Rudi Gernreich, which had moulded nylon cups attached to shoulder straps and a narrow elastic <tag "532790">band</> encircling the rib-cage.

Partly from health considerations, Watters retired from music in 1950, when his potential was greatest. 
He did reform the <tag "532736">band</> briefly but in 1957 left music for good to study geology and later to work as a chef in various Californian restaurants.   

801317
Young people and particularly the city's student population found the music ideal to drink beer to and, as Eddie Condon put it, it became so crowded that `It was difficult to get on intimate terms with a glass of beer in there." 
Later the Watters revival style became known as `good time music", eventually spreading across the world during the Forties and Fifties and occupying a large part of the jazz field to this day. 
The <tag "532736">band</> made copious recordings, now regarded as classic, from 1941 to 1950. 

801318
So is the basic idea, although the way that Glass and his librettist David Henry Hwang have dealt with it comes dangerously close to unintentional self-parody; especially as the subject matter is neurosis, for which Mr Glass's music supplies such an easy metaphor. 
1,000 Airplanes is a monodrama, roughly in the tradition of Erwartung and Pierrot Lunaire, which sets a spoken narrative against an instrumental <tag "532736">band</>, miked up to volume levels that should interest the Environmental Health inspectorate.   

801319
Most notably the spirit of celtic icon Van Morrison hangs over Primitive Man, while the busking spirit of Martin Stephenson and the Western swing of Lyle Lovett has invested the album with a stylistic diversity that never yields to the threat of banality and superficial style-hopping. 
It is a record that grows gently on you, and fulfills the band's hope that they can make `not pop singles but good strong albums that sell well." 
As for the future, the hope is to sustain parallel lives on different stages, alternating between the <tag "532736">band</> and the boards.   

801320
They were unable to tie the knot on Saturday at Bicester Register Office after Debbie, 20, forgot to pick up a certificate from her local registrar in Banbury saying the wedding could go ahead. 
But Bletchington Prize Silver <tag "532747-p">Band</>, with whom William, 22, plays the Euphonium, still played Congratulations for the couple, with the bridegroom's mother Karen helping out on the cornet.

`William, it was really nothing". 
As The Thompson Twins solidified their position as `The <tag "532736">band</> Simon Bates likes to name drop most often", as Bronski Beat (despite their obvious sincerity) continually resembled a whistling kettle, and as Depeche Mode turned sado / masochism into such a lightweight subject that it wouldn't cause offence if your four year old daughter played `Master and Servant", The Smiths were to be heard crooning the very odd `William, It Was Really Nothing": `And everybody's got to live their life and God knows I've got to live mine". 

801323
But it's `The Way Love Used To Be" that stands out through an introduction of romance and a gentle, oriental-sounding backward tape loop. 
Unfortunately, it's indicative of the <tag "532736">band's</> limitations that the track reappears in reverse as `Desu Evol Yaw" on the second side and the dog braying motif recurs on `Lady Of Flame". 

801324
It could be contended that Richard Branson would have to enter under both categories, and thus be compared with himself: a real pickle. 
But Freda and Norman Payne are tenuously linked by a statistical <tag "533520">band</> of gold, just like Cassius and English China Clay, Moss and Bros, Steve and George Davis, and indeed David and Reckitt Coleman.

I'm like a <tag "532736-a">band</> leader, so no matter whether he gives me 14 pieces, 18 {typo bad="piecec",good="pieces"}, 2 pieces or 7 pieces, I can still orchestrate for them and I have the ability to take the music that he wants to orchestrate and do it differently, but he won't have to change the way he sings.

`It certainly is funny to hear those youngsters trying to play like old men," was trumpeter Bobby Hackett's comment on the band.

Apparently the Stateside A&and.M label wanted their charges to cut a couple of cover versions, to gimmick up the US public, hoping for some obvious pop. 
They reckoned without the <tag "532736">band's</> bloody `12 years on the barricades" stance, so instead of some kinda `Sympathy For The Devil" meets T Rex cop-out the Mekes have flipped through their cultural range corner and dug up some tasty oddball goof.

Christmas 1909 found him staying with the other members of the AGBS at Alpenrose, a house that his prosperous uncle John Gunston had built for his early retirement the year before, at Kidmore End in south Oxfordshire. 
It stood in eight acres of land, on which were kept cattle, pigs, and poultry, and became a favourite holiday place for all of what John Gunston called `Souza's <tag "532735-p">Band</>".

William, 22, of Valentia Close, Bletchington, and Debbie, 20, of The Crescent, Steeple Aston, had arranged to tie the knot at Bicester register office on Saturday and leave to the sound of a fanfare from Bletchington Prize Silver Band. 
But unfortunately because of a missing document the couple were unable to get married, although they still left the register office at Waverley House to the strains of `Congratulations" played by the silver band. 
Despite not being able to get married, William, who usually plays the euphonium in the <tag "532736">band</>, and Debbie still went ahead with their reception for nearly 60 guests at Bletchington village hall, where a disco was also held in the evening.

No wonder the demise of a group often leaves its members bereft. 
`Revolution begins at home, preferably in the bathroom mirror," wrote Bob Mould on the sleeve of his <tag "532736">band</> Husker Du's final album, Warehouse.

After that he had star status and played mainly as a guest with other bands. 
When he first visited London with Condon's band in 1957 Bill was `drinking two bottles of Scotch a day and whatever anyone else forced on me". 
I know this to be true, for I have yet to recover from the week I spent in London when the <tag "532736">band</> was there.

Ben still rolls his eyes and acts the ringmaster in his role as the David Owen of pop. 
A leader without a party to go to, he nods and winks his way through the set crammed with seaside singalongs, while brother Scott grins cheesily at the girls during a knockabout `Theme From The New Avengers".

It might be a different medium, but Mamet is still obsessed by the niggling little things in life `You know, the basic themes, murder, lust, marriage, death; the usual little things &ellip. the primitiveness of mankind, having to hunt and be hunted." 
Mamet also sings on the band's forthcoming album, Down From Above, an accomplished mix of high-spirted folk conjuring up images of a designer Fairport Convention, laid-back swoony jazz and breezy pop. 
Technically, Down From Above is the <tag "532736">band's</> second album.  

801347
More specifically, he treats his buildings as landscapes of the imagination as well as structural responses to functional needs.

Used as a determining element in Byrne's own compositions, however, the effect is very different from earlier pan-cultural forays such as those on the Byrne / ENO collaboration My Life in the Bush of Ghosts; here, it's more like a cheap holiday in other people's misery, with Byrne clearly at ease, rather than at odds, with the foreign style. 
The result is that, for the most part, it's the traditional strengths of the various native styles that impress, rather than the way Byrne adapts them &dash. the peerless syncopation of Willie Colon's <tag "532736">band</>, for instance, is that much bigger than the setting Byrne provides for it.

801352
If any one theme emerged from the festival, particularly during a two-day Shakespeare seminar, it was the old conflict between directorial concepts and an actor-oriented theatre: my own view is that it is a largely phoney war since the best directors produce the best performances. 
You could also not have had a better vindication of conceptual theatre than Roberto Ciulli's amazing production of The Threepenny Opera from the Theatre on the Ruhr in Muelheim. 
This was based on the idea that Brecht's equation of criminal and bourgeois society may have been politically subversive in 1928 but was now a commonplace: what we saw was a brilliant piece of theatrical deconstruction in which the Brecht-Weill classic was played as an ironic, tacky, twenties vaudeville with the immortal, sawn-off tunes being pumped out by a raffish <tag "532736">band</> against a background of beer-advertisements.

Vocalists Cindy Wilson, Kate Pierson and Fred Schneider are still in fresh, slick and quirky form, and now have two distinguished producers, Nile Rodgers and Don Was. 
Rodgers" selection consists largely of kooky ballads and jolly summertime pop, while Was (of Was Not Was fame) leads the <tag "532736">band</> into a more urgent, tight dance style with the brassy R &and.B of Love Shack, or the throbbing and whooping Channel Z. As ever, it's throw-away pop, but quality throw-away pop. 

801355
The weeklies responded by rejecting chart pop and focussing their attention on fringe musical subcultures, notably British independent music. 
By the middle of the decade, circulation figures had plummeted to half their 1980 values and all three titles &dash. but the NME particularly &dash. came to be looked upon as apologists for the `indie ghetto", forever championing obscure and unlistenable <tag "532736">bands</> with silly names.

BUDDY REYNOLDS, who are you calling lowlifes?

`Sometimes it was difficult to defend," says Norman, `because at the time rap was all dicks and gold.

801358
IT IS difficult, but not impossible, to spot the links between the Simple Minds of 1989 and the Simple Minds of the early '80s. While the former favour a somewhat bombastic rock approach, the latter opted for a more atmospheric presentation. 
While his political sensibility has matured beyond recognition, Jim Kerr, mainstay and spokesman of the <tag "532736">band</>, has not altered his musical ambitions; older tracks like the evocative synthesizer-based Someone Somewhere In Summertime are a reminder that even when his audience was rather more modest, he still coloured his compositions in bold, anthemic strokes.   

801359
This, is could be argued, was the cause of the gig never quite living up to previous high standards. 
Tav &and. Co are essentially a stripped down rock 'n' roll <tag "532736">band</>, more reliant on rhythm and basic passion than volume and are subsequently unlike to `blow away" the average indie rock lover.

Eric Clapton is hardly your journeyman guitarist, and on Journeyman he has polished his exclusivity even further by his choice of musicians. 
Guest slots are reserved for the likes of George Harrison, Phil Collins, Daryl Hall, Chaka Khan and Robert Cray, whilst his basic <tag "532736">band</> is about as top-of-the-line as session crews get: Greg Phillinganes and Richard Tee on keyboards, Nathan East on bass, Jim Keltner on drums, and Jimmy Bralower on drum programmes, with even more specialist help where necessary.

Now lenders are offering finer and finer rates to entice new borrowers without, in many cases, offering the same terms to their existing borrowers, who would find it a troublesome and expensive experience to change lenders.

Lane first joined the band of the Royal Army Medical Corps as a youth, and progressed through Kneller Hall to the bandmastership of the 10th Royal Hussars in 1964 and subsequently to the Royal Hussars, followed by brigade bandmastership of the Greenjacket Brigade and then to director of music of the bands of the Women's Royal Army Corps, the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst Band Corps and finally, in 1977, to the Irish Guards. 
To all of his positions he brought a zest for life, the ability to compose and arrange music, and a rigorous sense of purpose. 
The `Micks" (the Irish Guards) were his great love, although he always retained the highest regard for his previous regiments and their <tag "532736">bands</>.

As with all so-called movements, an anti-movement is created instantaneously by the same audience. 
Marr and Morrissey believed in a certain purity and honesty. 
They decided to forget all current trends (such young <tag "532736-a">band</> paranoia, the decision to trend hop, often leads to directionless confusion anyway) and concentrate on keeping their music within the reach of their collective ability.

Don't let them pull wool over your eyes. 
The war was the cold, the wet, standing to your neck in a drain for a whole night with bloodhounds on your trail, not knowing how you could manage the next step toward the end of a long march.

Nightlife is generally quiet in Scheffau, though as you'd expect from such a friendly Tyrolean resort, fondues or barbeque parties and dancing to local music in the hotels and disco are all on offer.
