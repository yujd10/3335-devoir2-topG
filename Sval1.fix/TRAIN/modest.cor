The opening of the Britten Award not only to all genres but to all substantial new British works of the current decade raises both the general problem of how one appraises an opera as against an electronic work as against a piano trio, and the awesome possibility that an ultimate choice might have to be made between Tippett's upcoming opera New Year, Birtwistle's Mask of Orpheus, Goehr's Behold the Sun, and Maw's monster Odyssey &dash. though one could imagine a canny jury evading such a battle of the blockbusters by choosing, say, Judith Weir's engaging A Night at the Chinese Opera (the enlightened cachet of a woman composer too!). 
In evident apprehension that such a prospect might frighten off the young or composers of more <tag "510841">modest</> forms &dash. so that the danger of a Grand Old Man Prize became self-fulfilling &dash. the Foundation states that `the Award will be made in recognition of innovation and achievement".

In the year before the Nobel Foundation belatedly honoured this <tag "510840">modest</> and unassuming individual, one of his co-laureates to be, Donald Cram, commented presciently, Pedersen's discoveries were not the usual result of the efforts &ellip. of a large group of scientists under a director.

Its ridge was intended to be slightly lower than that of the original building, which it would join close to the majestic and dominant two-stack chimney. 
The inspector said it appeared to him that this and the <tag "510841">modest</> modern chimney proposed would ensure that the extension would not have the dominant and discordant impact foreseen by the council.

800016
There has been vast and often extremely unwise borrowing to finance the purchase of all sorts of consumer goods, largely imported. 
In quite practical terms, I would be much happier using my <tag "510839">modest</> savings to help finance necessary investment in Britain than to see it used to finance imports from abroad, or loans to the Third World which cripple rather than aid, or investments in other countries by big British financial institutions.

Mr Bush is now suggesting $300m for all Eastern Europe in fiscal 1991; the Senate and the House think this too little. 
The lion's share of whatever figure is agreed would go to Poland and Hungary: Czechoslovakia has not, as yet, requested direct aid (President Vaclav Havel, speaking to Congress, concentrated on the importance of helping the Soviet Union); Romania, so far, gets mainly subsidised food; there are no plans for helping Bulgaria; East Germany has West Germany; Yugoslavia gets almost no direct aid. 
Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the deputy secretary of state who has been given the job of co-ordinating America's help for Eastern Europe, was told by Congress that the money the administration has in mind is too <tag "510839">modest</>, but that its ideas about who should control the distribution of this money are immodest.

Mrs. Owen can hardly have approved when Cousin May, not content with painting her own face, set up a clinic for the removal of unwanted hair from the faces of ladies less artful than herself where their complexions were concerned. 
No doubt Susan Owen saw it as Divine Retribution when one of Cousin May's patients contracted blood-poisoning and the clinic had to close its doors under threat of legal damages. 
Fortunately, its proprietor escaped with a <tag "510839">modest</> settlement out of court, whereupon biting, as it were, the Hand of Providence, she plunged gaily into speculation on the stock market until, once again threatened with disaster, she decided to invest her remaining savings in a girls' private school at Scarborough.

By focusing attention exclusively on freedom-restricting changes one may create the false impression that the two presumptions are the same.

The nanny hustled the infants emphatically towards the door. 
She had already gathered that her new employer was extremely well connected and, as might be expected from a woman of her standing, required absolute discretion of her staff and the encouragement of her children in a properly <tag "510840">modest</> attitude to the family's privileged position.   

800038
My ambition to be a skilled worker, such as a draughtsman, was largely dashed by that failure.

So a company chairman earning dollars 750,000 a year and giving dollars 250,000 to the local orchestra would pay tax on only dollars 500,000.

After France and Shanghai, Parker spent an interesting war with Intelligence in India, Burma and Washington, ending it as a major in Japan after the Japanese surrender. 
He now works, so far as I can make out, for Mitsubishi, marvelling at the Japanese aptitude for work, but living much of the time in his <tag "510841">modest</> home in Oxfordshire, a happy man still looking for new challenges.

Parke certainly has a brain and showed he could use it under pressure.

Under such a scheme, fathers would be expected to pay towards their children even if they were unemployed or on a low wage. 
It is not unreasonable to expect a contribution equivalent to a couple of pints of beer even from those on <tag "510839">modest</> income.

Sir Geoffrey Howe's housing problems also made news again. 
A senior army officer found himself summarily ejected from his official house near the Tate Gallery to make room for the deputy prime minister, who had been living at an unsuitably <tag "510841">modest</> address near the Old Kent Road since losing his job as Foreign Secretary in the summer.

Usually, that passion curves back clumsily on itself, because most of Ford's characters are wary of going anywhere arrow-straight. 
For most of them, passion and longing flames briefly from amidst the modest wreckage and ordinary accidents of their lives. 
For them, passion is a lyrical wondering about the difficulty of things, and about the <tag "510839">modest</> consolations that recognising this difficulty brings.

The Dupatta (or Chunni as Hindus and Sikhs call it) is the most obviously symbolic part of a woman's clothes. 
Its function is basically to cover a woman's hair and hide the shape of her breasts but it can be worn in a variety of ways, draped round the top half of her body and head, folded over her chest and hanging over her shoulders or loosely placed round her neck. 
The way she wears it shows to the righteous and inquisitive observers always present in Asian communities just how <tag "510840 or 510838">modest</> she is.

It warned that the Government may still be forced to raise interest rates again. 
The organisation also concluded that the squeeze on inflation will only result in a <tag "510839">modest</> reduction in the current account deficit in 1990, and unemployment could rise significantly by 1991.

The North American flavour was emphasized by the fact that the simple station buildings contained `the traditional bay window on the low platform, housing the station-agent &dash. operator's office with the usual table in the bay complete with telegraph instruments, sounders, telephones, and so on". 
The station at La Paz, Bolivia, presents a sense of square, muscular, classical power, emphasized by its strong tower, but boasts only one platform behind.

But when the messenger describes Polyneices and his shield, bearing a figure of Dike leading home a man in armour, Eteocles responds with a cry which reflects his horror both in words and in its broken rhythm (lines 653-5). 
Eteocles' decision to face his brother in single combat, which comes at the end of this speech, is a decision to know, at whatever price, the ultimate meaning of Polyneices' so <tag "510841?">modest</> appearing shield device (lines 659-61):   

800059
The second half brought an improvement, but only after the full-back Mironov had switched with his outside half, Dzagnidze, and shownthat in the first half he had been wasted. 
His forwards also found some <tag "510839">modest</> co-ordination, driving downfield a number of times before setting their backs free. 

800060
He returned to Poland a hero, was named `Man of the Year" and was awarded a total of six gold medals by the Foreign Ministry for `Outstanding Performances in Sports Abroad". 
He was awarded an honorary silver medal by the Winter Olympic Committee in Calgary in 1988. 
Kukuczka remained a quiet and <tag "510840">modest</> man.

He is reputed to have more concern than his predecessor for the less well-off. 
He might consider doing something for the ordinary saver of <tag "510839">modest</> means, who is treated extraordinarily ungenerously by the tax system.

For Norman Lewis this experience illustrates his conviction that writers should enjoy their craft, for the result of not doing so is to end up like Hemingway. 
Lewis is <tag "510840">modest</> and self-effacing, reluctant to catapult his achievements at you, rather preferring to work unseen, offering finished works from which an observer or narrator seems absent.

Of the young players only 18-year-old Yugoslav Goran Ivanisevic appears a likely challenger on grass in the near future.

Mr Peter Marrow, a British Geological Survey seismologist in Edinburgh, said the epicentre of the quake was thought to be in the Wrexham area.

Private Eye has decided to pay #100,000 &dash. the sum raised by its readers for a fighting fund &dash. to families of the Ripper's victims.

HOW pleasant that the centenary of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds should correspond with the 200th anniversary year of Gilbert White's Natural History of Selborne! 
No book ever made a more <tag "510841">modest</> first appearance early in 1789, but it has been reprinted more often than all but a few of the greatest books, and will doubtless continue to be read as long as something recognisable as the English countryside remains.

Excluding oil production, which is forecast to recover from the disruptive effect of several accidents over the past two years, the economy will grow 3 4 per cent next year. 
The possibility of recession cannot be excluded and government figures indicate the slowdown will be at its most intense in the second half of next year. 
Despite the Treasury's clampdown on the economy, the expected reduction in inflation &dash. as measured by the retail price index &dash. will be <tag "510839">modest</> next year.

Mr Clayton said he also took into account that the particular section of the road in Upper Weston would be `detrunked" in the Autumn of 1990. 
Mr Clayton stated that the changes proposed to the use of the appeal property were <tag "510839">modest</> and were not likely to produce an unforeseen increase in vehicular traffic visiting the property.

But the talks themselves were a virtual stalemate. 
Khrushchev decided he liked Eisenhower, `a reasonable and <tag "510840">modest</> man", and the much discussed `Spirit of Camp David" meant that a lot of smiling went on in public.

Now Robinson has 16 outlets up and down the country, selling on its staple T-shirting, sweatshirting and knits, made to high standards in Hong Kong, supplemented by fast-moving high-fashion items like the British-made suits and their padded silk parkas. 
Determinedly <tag "510840">modest</>, Robinson refuses to be interviewed without his designers and merchandisers, preferring not to take the credit alone.

The British government has established a small fund for bringing the `know-how of pluralism" to Poland: in management, accountancy, banking, local government, tourism and even (God help us) journalism. 
As so often with British policy, it is the right thing, but not enough of it &dash. although Nigel Lawson promised in Washington that we would do more. 
The French have offered <tag "510839">modest</> new credits.

Romania's first family paid particularly close attention to the People's Palace, which, in this country of paradoxes, was never going to admit ordinary Romanians. 
The <tag "510841">modest</> abode of the Spring Palace, with its chandeliers and mock-antique furniture, was deemed too spartan, and the People's Palace was to be the Ceausescu dynasty's seat of power.   

800079
Tolba and Obasi estimated that about twenty countries would meet either of these two criteria, and that the total resources needed would be about one million dollars.

If anybody would be willing to assist in this, then David Gerrard was the man. 
She smothered her excitement with silent warnings about the number of slips between cup and lip, and the risk of counting unhatched chickens, and she cut confidence down to <tag "510971">modest</> hope.

Lyneham parish council had asked for the views of Shipton in connection with the application for a second golf course and a large club house by Mr D. G. Carpenter.

Either it can react with relief that the economy is not going into recession and that growth will therefore underpin corporate profitability, or it can react negatively to the fact that prospects for lower interest rates are dim. 
Treasuries registered <tag "510839">modest</> gains at midsession despite the stronger-than-expected purchasing managers' report, although they came off their earlier highs as the dollar suffered from a bout of profit-taking.

The pedals, too, seem to have been located by someone who has yet to discover the science of ergonomics. 
While the steering wheel is offset to the left, the pedals are positioned to the right. 
The brake and clutch are too close together for my <tag "510839">modest</> size sevens, and there's a huge foot-rest where I would normally expect a clutch pedal.

Trading was again thin, with the market waiting for today's Autumn Statement by the new Chancellor. 
A <tag "510839">modest</> 336 million shares changed hands in fewer than 22,000 transactions, and the FT-SE 100 index closed just 1.5 points higher at 2,214.7.   

800087
Texaco tried to suppress publication of the study, which was presented at a seminar at the Institute of Personnel Management at Harrogate yesterday. 
In the study, workers were found to be more <tag "510840">modest</>, ready to grasp change, artistic, and intellectually curious than the management ideal.  

800088
The same applies with greater force to education. 
Mr Major announced a <tag "510839">modest</> increase for higher education and virtually nothing for schools.   

800089
Below the oven is a large compartment specially contoured with rounded corners to help make cleaning easy. 
For all this, the Eclipse is no bulkier than our more <tag "510841">modest</> cookers.

At one time Footsie was down 42.6 points. 
It was hauled back by the <tag "510839">modest</> Wall Street recovery. 

800091
But expensive musicals prove a lot less potent than cheap music, especially when the big production numbers are actually rather small. 
And, for all Lindsay's <tag "510922">modest</> charms, Bert Rigby looks more like George Formby than a true Hollywood star.   

800092
There was no element of intrigue &dash. or not much. 
Yet the consequences were strikingly <tag "510839">modest</>, at any rate in appearance.   

800093
In London the FT-SE index of 100 top companies closed 40.4 points lower at 2,149.3, its lowest level since June. 
At one stage it was 42 points lower before staging a small rally. 
Volumes were thin with a relatively <tag "510839">modest</> 405 million shares changing hands.   

800094
Morgan Grenfell therefore looks resigned to the Suez link-up. 
The City, which marked the shares up a <tag "510839">modest</> 38p to 400p, is wise to assume a bid (of say 500p) is still at least 12 months away.   

800095
The Lunar Orbiter missions provided high-resolution photographs of  outstanding quality, which enabled detailed maps of the surface to be made,  which were used in the selection of the Apollo landing sites. 
The Russian lunar programme helped, too, on a more <tag "510839">modest</> scale, and  achieved a major success in obtaining the first pictures of the far side of  the Moon.   

800096
There was scarcely time to do more than this, and dive into her single suitcase for a warmer blouse, before she had to leave again for the police headquarters. 
She walked through the twisting lanes of Westminster, choosing to pass in front of the mother of Parliaments like a mere tourist. 
In her <tag "510841">modest</> clothes, no one turned to look at her.   

800097
The magazine believes that with additional finance it can not only bale itself out but become the leading English language magazine of the left for Europe. 
And its sights are set even further afield, on the United States and Australia where <tag "510839">modest</> sales are now being achieved.   

800098
And with that, he would wander back into his study, to all appearances still thoroughly engrossed in the volume held open in his hands. 
It was invariably embarrassment at what he was about to impart which made Lord Darlington adopt such an approach, and even once the study door was closed behind us, he would often stand by the window and make a show of consulting the encyclopedia throughout our conversation. 
What I am now describing, incidentally, is one of many instances I could relate to you to underline Lord Darlington's essentially shy and <tag "510840 or 510838">modest</> nature.   

800099
Starting in the late 1950s, one after another of the anachronistic features of tort law were dismantled, first the immunities &dash. family, charitable, and sovereign &dash. later the introduction of comparative fault both as between plaintiff and defendant (contributory negligence) and between defendants (contribution) and, most dramatic of all, strict liability for defective products. 
These doctrinal changes laid the groundwork for the remarkable transformation of the American law of torts from a relatively <tag "510839">modest</> to an aggressively expansive role in accident compensation.   

800100
A large organization obviously has more resources to work with than a small one, but it may also suffer from a complexity and inertia that negates much of its scale advantage. 
A <tag "510870">modest-sized</> organization often has the luxury of being able to scrap its existing system and build a new one in the right way; a large organization almost always has to deal with the enormously complex problem of phasing in new parts of the system so that they work concurrently with the remaining parts of the old.   

800101
Spurs would be lucky to receive #1m from ITV this season. 
So ITV is driving a comparatively <tag "510839">modest</> engine.   

800102
Since then, other nations mindful of the dignity of culture, such as Germany, or with tax systems conducive to the emergence of benign foundations, such as the United States, have instituted prestigious composition awards; some of the American ones, like the Grawemeyer, which Harrison Birtwistle won for The Mask of Orpheus in 1987, are astonishingly lucrative &dash. dollars 150,000 in 1987. 
British prizes, such as the Clements Memorial for chamber music or the Whyte Award for orchestral works, by which some of our younger composers have been grateful for a leg up, remain <tag "510839">modest</> indeed by comparison &dash. so that calls for a compositional Booker-type prize, both to help individuals more generously and to raise public awareness of new music in general, have been going on for some time.   

800103
ALAN GREENSPAN, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, said yesterday that progress towards eliminating US inflation could be achieved without driving the economy into recession. 
However, in testimony to a banking sub-committee of the House of Representatives, Mr Greenspan acknowledged that seeking a goal of zero inflation &dash. compared with inflation of 4.5 per cent at present &dash. within the next five years would inevitably entail `some <tag "510839">modest</> loss of economic output".   

800104
Should the cocoa price begin to reflect producers' changing expectations, say by the end of 1990, the effect on other soft commodities could be considerable. 
Sugar, cocoa, and coffee did not benefit from the <tag "510839">modest</> recovery in commodity prices during 1988 and 1989 because they are structurally in over-supply. 

800105
Job injuries have mostly retained the historical link with workers' compensation in providing income-related benefits, though subject to `caps". 
Since tort damages would be reduced by these benefits, resort to tort recovery by the victim is largely discouraged except in cases of severe injury when it might be worth his while to pursue damages for non-economic loss or, in the case of high income earners, for the excess income loss. 
Therefore the higher the scale of benefits and the more <tag "510839">modest</> the prevailing tariff for non-pecuniary tort damages, the more tort liability is elbowed out by social insurance. 

800107
Beside the tangles of Europe, Jenni Murray's portrait of Cory Aquino in the series Women In Politics (BBC2) was areminder that the exercise of power in the Third World is less complex and more brutal. 
Aquino always comes over as the warmest and most <tag "510840">modest</> of the women who have struggled through to lead their countries over the past few years &dash. she must also be about the richest, with huge estates &dash. and there she is reaffirming her Mitchell &ellip. kidney punches intention not to stand for president in 1992.   

800108
A hundred jobs at Aycliffe were lost last year as part of a package of 1,800 redundancies announced throughout GPT following the setting up of the joint venture, the purpose of which was to cut costs and avoid duplication in the highly cost-competitive telecom industry. 
City analysts said at the time that the cuts, from a 23,000 workforce, were too <tag "510839">modest</> and would save less than half the #30million costs targetted for saving as part of a rationalisation programme.   

800109
Churches of other denominations are not exempt from the system so that, for instance, noteworthy former Methodist or Roman Catholic churches may qualify for listing while redundant Anglican churches of similar worth and date remain immune from such protection. 
The Church of England operates its own structure of listing which is roughly the same as the classifications applied to historically or architecturally important secular buildings. 
The finest examples of its church architecture, including the ancient cathedrals, are listed `Grade I" and a very large number of more <tag "510841">modest</> churches are listed `Grade II" but this internal system lacks the safeguards against ill-considered alteration and demolition which are built into the statutory system.  

800110
So he hit upon the scheme of occupying the spare time he didn't want by starting up another business on the side. 
The result was Benson Kitchens, an operation which supplies freshly made food to other pubs, or to his customers who want to save themselves the hassle of cooking at home once in a while. 
With contacts in the main London meat and vegetable markets and his skills as a chef, Alan is able to offer an interesting assortment of dishes at <tag "510839">modest</> prices. 

800111
In a few seconds last December this became the responsibility of a police force with only 346 officers and a budget of little more than #10m. 
Even in the darkness and confusion of that first night senior officers with Dumfries and Galloway Police knew it was beyond the <tag "510839">modest</> resources of their force. 

800112
When he beat Yasser Seirawan, the United States number one, to reach the last eight, it was an added bonus. 
By the time he had defeated Nigel Short to enter the semi-final, it was realised that the <tag "510840">modest</> and eccentric Speelman was a genuine world title contender.

She was taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford where her condition is satisfactory.

800114
An increase of 5-6 per cent will be passed on to more than 1,100 tenants. 
Ind Coope marketing director Martin Davies, defending the rise as <tag "510839">modest</>, said: `We fought hard to keep the price rise below the rate of inflation."  

800115
The silvery underside of this material is exposed to the interiors of the studio and living/dining areas, but these are such lofty spaces that this inexpensive treatment does not detract from their grandeur. 
The colour scheme is monochromatic throughout in accordance with Russell Mills' preference to keep the space ` &ellip. clear and simple, everything visually quiet". 
Selective demolition of some post-Victorian accretions (like the independent WC block on the western boundary) helped to make the building more suitable for its new use, but otherwise external alterations were very <tag "510841">modest</>. 

800116
Stock, Aitken and Waterman had taken her under their  protective wing and such master opportunities didn't need any  convincing that the success of the soap could be translated  into success in the record business. 
Together with Kylie's  talent and ambition, the situation offered a recipe for riches  beyond even their wildest dreams. 
Kylie's departure was an emotional affair for almost  everyone at Grundy, the <tag "510839">modest</> television company that never  really grasped Neighbours worldwide success.   

800117
A crisis in the Duchy would probably mean the white wine had run out. 
The populace did manage to raise a decent cheer, however, when yesterday's first stage, a <tag "510839">modest</> 135.5km jaunt around the Grand Duchy, was won by Portugal's Acacio Da Silva.   

800118
The impression is that Australia have become slightly rattled by their inability to keep winning. 
When players try too hard collectively and individually, as was probably the case in Brisbane, it can be counter-productive and Sri Lanka come to Hobart holding the psychological advantage. 
But, given their relatively <tag "510839">modest</> attack, it is difficult to see them winning this match on what should be a good pitch.   

800119
But expensive musicals prove a lot less potent than cheap music, especially when the big production numbers are actually rather small. 
For all the very <tag "510922">modest</> charms of Lindsay's performance, Bert Rigby looks ill at ease in Hollywood &dash. less a true descendant of Gene Kelly (to whom the film is `lovingly" dedicated) than, as the echoes in his name suggest, a more unglamorous role-model closer to home.   

800120
One Cabinet minister, however, is likely to have saved some money on his hotel bill to go towards his bid for next year. 
John Gummer, the Minister of Agriculture, has been staying not at the Imperial, but at a <tag "510841">modest</> B-&and.-B at the back of the conference hall.   

800121
Conversely, critical silence condemned many a modernist to professional obscurity. 
Earnest and sincere efforts were made to bring high art to the people by the museums, many of which, particularly in the postwar era, began to sell colour reproductions from their collections at <tag "510839">modest</> prices.   

800123
Dealing only with pedestrian data processing, they are not at all aimed at strategic needs of the organization. 
They generally provide little direct operational support and have only <tag "510839">modest</> impact on decision making at the middle or higher levels of management.   

800124
The week also brought further confirmation that the economic slowdown is deepening &dash. retail sales in October fell by 0.7 per cent and the fall in unemployment moderated &dash. and that high interest rates are beginning to bite into company profits. 
The clearest picture of the impending downturn was provided by British Steel which expects a weakening in world demand and is shedding 1,200 jobs to keep costs in check. 
The doom and gloom of the retail sector was echoed by Coloroll, which blamed interest rates for halving its profits to #10m and putting 450 people out of work, and by Burton which had the City hurriedly downgrading expectations for next year following the announcement of a <tag "510839">modest</> 6 per cent rise in 1988-89 profits. 

800125
Until yesterday's report, the stock market had been unaware of any speculation surrounding Williams. 
Share volumes had been <tag "510839">modest</> and the price showed very little movement.

But a wind of change had already begun to blow at Newport Pagnell. 
For the two years before Ford's buy-up, Aston Martin Lagonda had actually shown a profit (albeit <tag "510839">modest</>), the first time in its history that it had managed to do so two years running.   

800127
In a first round of voting during the summer, and then during their closed-doors assembly at a secret spot in Berlin yesterday, the musicians came out in favour of a likeable man who has worked well with all kinds of orchestras, and who is diplomatic rather than autocratic. 
While von Karajan created his own personality cult &dash. which added greatly to the orchestra's prestige and earnings &dash. Abbado is <tag "510840">modest</>, unassuming and hates publicity.

It gives me the chance to say that the Arts Council is indeed concerned that our arts infrastructure should be first rate. 
Last week we launched `Building for the Arts", a <tag "510839">modest</> #50,000 scheme to support feasibility studies for new arts buildings and existing ones in need of renovation.

Net advances in September, published today, were the highest this year even without the Abbey's contribution.

The tourist village's population of 500, more than half of whom had voted by mid-afternoon, were clearly taking the election in their stride, as waiters, labourers, cleaners, and taxi-drivers joined long queues to cast their vote. 
The polling station consisted of a <tag "510841">modest</> room in the town's Cultural and Information Centre, where Bulgaria's white, green and red flag was draped across several trestle tables presided over by half-a-dozen grim-faced and rather tired-looking officials. 

800133
One of his most useful contacts is a firearms and explosives expert on the Detroit Police Squad. 
The programme offered the unique opportunity to hear a <tag "510838 or 510840">modest</> and quietly spoken 65-year-old confess to having troubled himself with the question, `How do you blow up a car?"

Also at Haydock, the 5lb claim of talented apprentice jockey Jimmy Fortune eases the burden on topweight NATIVE GEM (4.45) and this filly's consistency should be rewarded. 
Best of a full but not very dis tinguished rental month (the blockbusters are coming in November, leading with Rain Man, Roger Rabbit, Dangerous Liaisons and Mississippi Burning) is Parents (18 Vestron), which is simultaneously both scary and funny. 
From the start of this <tag "510839?">modest</> but compelling chiller, you sense that the family, moving to suburban Indiana in 1958, has got a skewed and sinister undertow.

Cakobau thus had both status and influence which belied his humble occupational beginnings as a clerk in the colonial secretariat. 
His <tag "510913">modest</> formal education was largely outside Fiji &dash. at Newington College in Sydney and Wanganui Technical College in New Zealand.

Mr Newton insisted he need make no apologies for the decision. 
An increase in child benefit did nothing for the least well-off but distributed a substantial sum of money in relatively <tag "510839">modest</> amounts to a large number of people, some of whom had large incomes, he said.   

800138
This is not only a legal matter but also reflects the security implications which are unavoidably raised by this development. 
In much more <tag "510971">modest</> terms there is a case for a stronger association between East Germany and the EC.

His last words, `Bugger Bognor", are now thought to be apocryphal: ie not true. 
While all this had been going on, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second had just been born, in a <tag "510841">modest</> town house near Hyde park, though of course she did not yet know who she was.   

800140
Inside this framework the existing modern sector may well struggle for survival. 
Large-scale, publicly-owned enterprises will breathe their last gasp and wither away well before the state which spawned them. 
Large-scale, private businesses in manufacturing, geared to relatively high-value consumer products, will find little room for expansion as the incomes of most urban consumers continue to be very <tag "510839">modest</>.

The clothes people wear always have a symbolic value but for Asian women this symbolism is extremely formalised. 
Clothes are made with the family's approval and love but also so that women can look as their families wish to see them &dash. <tag "510838">modest</>, maternal, self-effacing, or just beautiful on their terms.   

800143
Sometimes it appears to be little more than this, as in the case of the temporary vogue for `Occitania" in France in the 1970s, the shift of a number of able intellectuals of the Left to Scottish nationalism in the same decade and the preoccupation with what was claimed to be Valencian national identity in the early 1980s among left intellectuals of the Spanish Levante. 
Sometimes it represents more serious and massive popular discontents, as in the renewed turn to Scottish nationalism in the late 1980s, plainly a reaction both to an all-British government supported by only a <tag "510839">modest</> minority of Scots and a politically impotent all-British opposition party.   

800144
Judges of more liberal political orientation than in the past, combined with the growing sophistication and muscle of the plaintiffs' bar, augured well for the cause of tort reform. 
The process commenced on a relatively <tag "510971">modest</> note by appeal to rationality rather than radical reform.

The aim of this section was not to suggest that such conflicts do not arise, nor to argue that when they do rights should always give way. 
The conclusion of this section is the more <tag "510971">modest</> one: rights are not to be understood as inherently independent of collective goods, nor as essentially opposed to them.

A yellow Bedford van he was following along the inside lane of the motorway, with `RIVIERA SUNBEDS" blazoned on it in orange lettering, evoked a poignant image of his wife vainly beautifying herself at home, unaware of the thunderbolt that had already struck her life.

WORLD stock markets yesterday sent out an optimistic message for the New Year as West German and Japanese share prices staged strong rallies and London and New York shares put on respectable gains. 
No single theme ran through the climb in share values around the world but, even though trading was thin, important new trends &dash. like the search for entirely new investment opportunities &dash. were discernible. 
Moreover, <tag "510839">modest</> gains on Wall Street, encouraged by prospects of lower US interest rates, helped sentiment elsewhere.

The scale of the decay influences the scale of the renovation work and it determines how the life of the completed building may be extended. 
Many old buildings do not have foundations in the sense of a calculated, designed and carefully executed interface between the superstructure and the ground, yet they continue to resist loads from the building without apparent distress. 
Nowadays, even the most <tag "510841">modest</> buildings on good ground tend to have mass-concrete strip footings beneath their walls in order to spread the loads.

Greater London, the South East, including Oxfordshire, and the East and West Midlands will see increases averaging 86%.

THE RETURN of figurative painting to respectability among art connoisseurs has been under way for almost a decade but is not complete. 
The <tag "510839">modest</> prices, mostly between #600 and #1,200, set on paintings of India at the Francis Kyle Gallery in Maddox Street, central London, demonstrate an acceptance that they will not be treated by the public as high art.

The pools is how Littlewoods first began back in 1923 when John Moores, a working class lad from Manchester, made his first million with a winning blend of football and gambling. 
Seventy years later, the magic mix of high rewards, low outlay and supposed skill in judging football results, continues unchanged; except, of course, that punters can now win #1.5 million instead of the <tag "510839">modest</> #2 12s that comprised the first ever dividend.

There is, however, no moaning at the bar at Covent Garden; rather the opposite, for the administration and its supporting fund raisers have rolled up their sleeves and produced for next year the astonishing equation of 40 per cent of revenue from the box office, 40 per cent from grant, and 20 per cent from sponsorship and private funding. 
All the major opera houses on the Continent are subsidised up to 60 per cent or more, and the Vienna Opera to the tune of 80 per cent.

There are just hints of Balthus's influence in her interiors; enough to add a piquancy to a supremely-decorative style.

But this resistance is weakened in the present context by allegations of misuse of power by the security services. 
Whatever the merits of the arguments against Mr Soley's proposal for a Select Committee in place of the Commissioner, they are much less convincing when applied to the more <tag "510971">modest</> proposal put forward at the time by the SDP that there could be a Select Committee confining itself to the Commissioner's report `so that in turn it would report and give some reality to parliamentary accountability".

My quarrel is with the widespread assumption that shopping malls &dash. or complexes, concourses, plazas, or even centres, as they used more modestly to be called &dash. are necessarily a bad thing. 
Confronted, typically on a Saturday, with even a <tag "510839">modest</> shopping list &dash. comprising, say, a birthday card for Auntie Gladdy, two grey sweaters for little Jamie, picture hooks, a couple of blank video tapes, the new Iris Murdoch novel, something for tea and some stuff to seal in the bathtub &dash. surely even an architect, even a prince, would appreciate the shopping centre's advantages.

No sooner had he registered that impression of ancient serenity, than it was obliterated by the close-up view of the wounds of three years of civil war. 
The mountains endured in the distance, while in the foreground he saw only half-destroyed buildings, staircases cascading into sudden void, walls pockmarked with bullets, rooms ripped open to expose the <tag "510838?">modest</> secrets of their inhabitants' lives to the baking air of high summer.

In day-to-day afairs, Labour, despite its class character, had become part of `the nation" , almost without noticing it. 
For an ordinary man of <tag "510971">modest</> ambitions, Labour, like the Conservative party, was the path to influence and honour &dash. if he were a working man, the more rewarding path.

Earlier this week, Shearson Lehman Hutton, the second largest brokerage on Wall Street, announced 800 redundancies. 
A <tag "510839">MODEST</> rise in US wholesale prices last month confirmed that US inflationary pressures are easing and underlined the weak economic background which allowed the US Federal Reserve to loosen its monetary policy this week.

`I suppose I was very irritating and I would have been regarded as a know-all." 
Despite his self-confessed cockiness and his constantly-repeated assertion `I'm not a <tag "510840">modest</> man", Elsworth, with his rakish smile and ready wit, is one of the most approachable and well-liked characters in racing.   

800177
This evening I find myself settled here in this comfortable guest house in a street not far from the centre of Salisbury. 
It is, I suppose, a relatively <tag "510841">modest</> establishment, but very clean and perfectly adequate for my needs.   

800178
While Andries had blamed that defeat on dietary problems, most predicted he would fare no better yesterday because of his advanced years. 
Andries's achievement must now rank alongside the greatest triumphs by British boxers overseas, such as Jack `Kid" Berg's victory over the Cuban Kid Chocolate in Harlem in 1930, Ken Buchanan's win over Ismael Laguna at Madison Square Garden in 1972, and Lloyd Honeyghan's stoppage of the previously undefeated Donald Curry at Atlantic City in 1986. 
But, remarkably for one who began his career with such <tag "510842">modest</> pedigree, Andries has surpassed his peers by reaching the pinnacle of his profession three times. 

800179
But senior TUC leaders have rejected his proposals as too drastic and have asked him to come up with a modified plan in time for the annual congress in September. 
They also want the congress to be a more <tag "510841">modest</> affair.   

800180
The program resulting from this hierarchical factoring has a modular structure, with each component termed a module. 
It is generally considered good programming practice to keep each module to a <tag "510839">modest</> size &dash. no more than about 60 lines of code, say, the number that can fit on one printed page.

The gardens are patrolled by peacocks and a patiently stalking white cat and manage to be both as formal, sculptural and as lovely as the castle. 
Nearby is Elgar's birthplace, a touchingly <tag "510841">modest</> house.   

800184
In 1986-7 the Severn-Trent Water Authority spent a mere 5 per cent of its total annual river-maintenance budget on just such endeavours. 
If everyone responsible for the maintenance of watercourses rises to such a proportionally <tag "510839">modest</> commitment, then the loveliest of our existing rivers will not be lost, and all the miles of denuded drain which lie waiting, like  sleeping beauties, in intensive care will, over the space of a generation, recover life and elegance as they carry away their essential cargo of flood-water to the open sea.

Although there is no lack of quantity for Lingfield's debut, the conditions of entry for all-weather races ensures that quality Flat performers can remain snug in their boxes during the winter. 
No horse rated by the Jockey Club above a <tag "510839">modest</> 90 for Flat racing, or above 125 for National Hunt events, can take part in handicaps at the two courses concerned.  

800186
Let me make clear that when I say the conference of 1923, and that night in particular, constituted a turning point in my professional development, I am speaking very much in terms of my own more humble standards. 
Even so, if you consider the pressures contingent on me that night, you may not think I delude myself unduly if I go so far as to suggest that I did perhaps display, in the face of everything, at least in some <tag "510839">modest</> degree a `dignity" worthy of someone like Mr Marshall &dash. or come to that, my father.   

800187
He advocated `Notional" studies which, having `nothing to do with the senses", are `therefore more divine". 
He suggested, also, that an undue concentration on the new natural philosophy might lead to a certain intellectual arrogance. 
`May not a man go too far in this study, and overvalue his progress so far, as to think nothing out of his reach?" So far as Gassendi and (as we shall see) Locke were concerned this objection is misplaced for, having a <tag "510840?">modest</> and moral view of our proper concerns, they retain an element of scepticism about man's ability to know. 

800188
She had to defend her idea, which argued for a later extermination of carnivorous dinosaurs than was generally held; she had to describe her sources and  compare new finds. 
Quite apart from her book she had a <tag "510839">modest</> but real reputation in late dinosaur studies.   

800189
Her abrupt manner and fearless integrity antagonised some and was misinterpreted by others who failed to understand an underlying vulnerability. 
But she bore no malice and was essentially <tag "510840">modest</>.

We got four of these on Sunday night after a programme of Schumann and Chopin which packed the Queen Elizabeth Hall. 
It was not entirely a familiar choice of repertoire, for Mr Alexeev began with Schumann's rarely-played Four Pieces, Opus 32, comprising a slightly stodgy scherzo, a gigue, a surprisingly forceful romanze, and a sweet, <tag "510841?">modest</> fughetta.   

800191
For most of us their writings are too hard to come by. 
A small group of readers and writers, sharing these feelings, send out this first issue of Contemporary Verse A Canadian Quarterly in high hope that it &ellip. may play a worthy part in the building of Canadian literature." 
It was a <tag "510840">modest</> statement (in the very first issue of CV in September 1941) by an editor who seldom wrote editorials and kept his own literary opinions in the background. 

800192
A handful of domestic takeover bids and the annual ritual of shareholder battles which pit raiders against managements and which is as lively as ever this year, also indicate that work is picking up for the rainmakers. 
Even the moribund UAL buyout with a similar script but a different cast is staging its latest revival. 
One way of looking at this sudden burst of activity is to put it down to springtime on Wall Street and regard it as a <tag "510839">modest</> blip on a trend which is still heading firmly downwards.   

800193
`We would have had some difficulty fitting even a small party in here, as you can see." 
She dipped her head apologetically, indicating the <tag "510839">modest</> proportions of their new home.

Pakistan's win &dash. they scored 150 for eight in 37 overs and dismissed India for 112 in 30.2 &dash. maintained their recent success in one-day competitions, following triumphs in the Sharjah tournament and the Nehru Cup in India. 
Pakistan, although defending a <tag "510839">modest</> total in this third and last game here, won on the strength of inspired bowling by their pace quartet of Imran, Wasim Akram, Aaqib Javed and Waqar Younus, who took full advantage of cloudy conditions.   

800195
The man was Andrew Mlangeni, 63, a leading member of the banned ANC and its military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), who had only hours before been released from prison by the South African government, along with seven other political prisoners serving life sentences for sabotage. 
The response from the crowds that had gathered outside Mr Mlangeni's <tag "510841">modest</> home in Ndlovu Street threw clouds of dust into the air, and Mr Mlangeni and his wife, June, smiled as the well-wishers sang and danced their welcome.   

800196
Feel is still good but communicated in less specific terms. 
At <tag "510839">modest</> speeds, everything feels just a little inert and aloof.   

800197
Closer examination of the Scottish situation reveals the root cause of the conflict to be the Government's blinkered approach to land-use policies &dash. typified by the decision to allow afforestation of the Flow Country of Sutherland and Caithness, which forced the NCC on to the defensive, seeking to conserve a vast peatland against land-hungry foresters keen to take advantage of tax relief and grants. 
Only by standing firm and offering advice from a national perspective was the NCC able to secure a <tag "510913">modest</> compromise.   

800198
The strength of these funds, 17 of which show a return of better than 17 per cent, lies in their re-conversion from dollars to sterling. 
Most UK investors will want to invest with a sterling denominated cheque, rather than convert to dollars beforehand. 
The sterling-denominated funds have recorded relatively <tag "510839">modest</> gains across a narrow spread of returns.

Its brightly coloured glass depicts St Bartholomew clad in robes of red, blue and gold.

Most Dominions and some foreign countries followed Great Britain off gold in 1931. 
Together these constituted the Sterling Area, in which the bank of England performed its historic role on a more <tag "510839">modest</> field.   

800203
Kent and Yorkshire even refused to recruit from outside of their territorial frontiers. 
Wearing the county tie was a mark of <tag "510839">modest</> social distinction and with that went the responsibility of meeting debts and subsidizing the side.   

800205
The USM-quoted New England Properties, part of a consortium which plans to redevelop London's County Hall, saw its shares increase 1.5p to 20p, a 8.5 per cent advance, and still offer upside potential. 
Bringing up the rear is SelecTV, the television production company whose shares have seen a <tag "510839">modest</> 8 per cent rise to 13.5p. 

800206
Oxford had no similar advantages. 
But it had a number of <tag "510839">modest</> assets. 

800207
Often, the walls of the crater are made of a series of concentric terraces,  and this has led many observers to suggest that some kind of subsidence has  taken place, with the floor of the crater being lowered relative to its  surroundings. 
This, of course, again sounds reminiscent of caldera  formation, but even a <tag "510839">modest</> lunar crater is still ten times the size of  the Mt Katmai caldera.  

800208
Otherwise, only those helped the state who wished to do so. 
The Englishman paid taxes on a <tag "510839">modest</> scale: nearly #200 million in 1913-14, or rather less than 8 per cent. of the national income.   

800209
In 1961 Union Minie&grave.re made a naked bid to split off Katanga from the rest of Zaire. 
In the early 1970s the cynical and exploitative role of multinational companies appeared to be confirmed as it became clear that Shell and BP, the latter half-owned by the British government, were the principal source of oil supplies to the outlawed Smith regime of Rhodesia. 
Such dramatic examples of commercial self-interest were not in reality offset by the more representative efforts of companies such as Unilever, Mitchell Cotts and Booker McConnell in English-speaking Africa, or CFAO in French-speaking Africa who had invested on a long term basis for relatively <tag "510839">modest</> returns.

Lian Lian was admitted to hospital with bruised legs, but four days later, doctors reported that she moulted `from the chest to the feet" &dash. a `bizarre phenomenon" that continued for three months.

PowerGen believes it has to make massive investments in modern plant, perhaps up to pounds 4bn over 10 years, to prosper in the new environment. 
Although Hanson has traditionally bought companies requiring only <tag "510839">modest</> capital injections, Sir Gordon said he was committed to making the necessary investments at PowerGen.

London's Covent Garden, a magnet for the very people supposedly most afflicted by Mr Major's mortgage squeeze (young and South-east based) is virtually impassable with free-spending shoppers. 
Nevertheless, the evidence from the Central Statistical Office paints a different picture. 
The sharp month-on-month fall in retail sales volumes last month surprised the City, which had been expecting a <tag "510839">modest</> increase.   

800215
Hunt Thompson's architecture strikes a very different note. 
It has tried to evolve an architecture that reflects the building and design traditions of the area, its current use and communities, and which expresses some contemporary qualities. 
On the edge of their site bordering the conservation area, they propose a <tag "510841">modest</> and almost exact essay upon Spitalfields's early Georgian architecture.

Then there was his colleague for Romsey and Waterside, Michael Colvin.

The threat of a takeover is not treated lightly. 
For years Boots was considered a dull dog with changes so rare as to be barely perceptible.

On 8 December they start a Test match in Brisbane and at the end of the following week another, the first ever, in Hobart.

At this point the embassy press attache, Donald Hauger, who sat in on our conversation, intervened. 
`Mrs Catto is probably too <tag "510840">modest</>," he said, `but you ought to know that the Foreign Service has lodged vehement protests against many former ambassadorial appointments, but Ambassador Catto was not vetoed at all; on the contrary, he was welcomed."

They belonged, and would continue to belong, to the uncorrupted Third World. 
If he himself had played any part in this process &dash. most notably through his friendships with Amin, Gadafy, Bokassa, and other wonderful leaders &dash. it would be one of his proudest achievements, ranking with the pacification of the Armenians, of the Russians under Stalin, of the Jews during the Second World War, of the Tibetans by the Chinese, of the Cambodians by Pol Pot: to name just a few of the great enterprises in which he had played a <tag "510839">modest</> part.

But most of the rest of his career was as a travel photographer working for P &and. O and Union Castle, as well as the tourist boards for the Bahamas, Barbados and Jamaica, where he went every second winter to photograph personalities such as Joan Crawford or Richard Lester, and incidentally took the last photographs of Ian Fleming and Noel Coward. 
Goodman was always hard up and enjoyed the friendship and generosity of friends such as Francis Bacon who would help him out. 
Always self-deprecating and <tag "510840">modest</>, he fought bravely a long struggle against cancer, remaining cheerful and full of amusing unrepeatable anecdotes.   

800225
Grammar schools separated themselves from Public Schools (although, more accurately, it was of course the other way round) by embedding themselves in the local provision for secondary education. 
They were the schools attended by the children of parents able to pay a <tag "510839">modest</> but not negligible fee, together with the boys and girls who had by their own ability won a free or subsidized place.   

800226
Romanian dissidents were few and far between; the secret police were everywhere and the prisons were full. 
The `cult" of Ceausescu was carried to laughable extremes, making Stalin's look quite <tag "510840">modest</>.

Patrick was a bully, a Hibernian savage, an ex-heavyweight champion of Trinity who struck people. 
` The scuffling over Patrick's soul may soon move to a more prosaic level, that of his <tag "510839">modest</> estate and, in particular, the Irish copyright to his writings.

But eventually he was mollified and went on his way, drawing all eyes, swapping his watch for a cigar from a factory worker, feeling the maize cobs in the Iowa corn belt, stuffing himself with hot dogs before the television cameras. 
This uninhibited tourist did not look like the Frankenstein monster whom many Americans had expected and some of them began to wonder if they had got Khrushchev and his <tag "510838">modest</> and dignified wife wrong.

He just keeps saying he is glad to be able to do his bit for Italy and that it is a wonderful experience to play for them in an Italian World Cup. 
Perhaps it is his <tag "510842">modest</> Sicilian origins.

They are priced at #75,000 each. 
For more <tag "510839">modest</> spenders, there are panels of eighteenth-century Lyons silk, priced from #750.

They even missed a late penalty when the indulgent Bilek bizarrely attempted to lob the goalkeeper Meola. 
It took the Czechoslovaks 25 minutes to find their rhythm against such eager but <tag "510839">modest</> opposition. 

800232
Because that span is likely to be wider as a result of injecting the uncertainty of fee-shifting, the American rule would tend to improve the chances of settlement. 
The typical risk-aversion by persons of <tag "510839">modest</> means would reinforce that pull: increasing the gap will also feed their anxiety.

The most important information on movement of people is from the Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch and military intelligence in Northern Ireland, which includes surveillance work there by the SASFeeding into the network are telephone intercepts by the Government Communications Headquarters, and when deemed appropriate, information from M15. 
Despite this concentration of expertise, the <tag "510839">modest</> successes on the mainland have all come from vilgilant citizens or haphazard mistakes by the IRA.

It is characteristic that the more <tag "510840">modest</> member of these august committees fail to recognize themselves as belonging to the Great and Good, a tribe which lives in the great terra incognita of Quangoland.

Derek Hunt, Thames finance director, said there were fundamental differences between the Reeves purchase and the MTM deal. 
`In relative terms, this is a considerably more <tag "510839">modest</> deal than the purchase of MTM," said Mr Hunt, `and it is a considerably different type of operation."

The technique has a breadth which shows she has looked carefully at Manet, and the paintings of nudes, especially those of nude couples, have a powerful erotic charge.

800237
The three states with an exclusively verbal threshold recorded lower insurance costs than would have been without no-fault. 
Conversely, very high no-fault benefits accompanied by only very <tag "510839">modest</> limitations on tort claims resulted in large premium increases, leading Pennsylvania to repeal no-fault altogether in 1984.   

800238
The unasked question is whether society is prepared to foot the bill. 
Legislative intervention has been episodic and of <tag "510839">modest</> scope.

No wonder. 
As millions watch him shake his periwig in sorrow or anger, he has become one of the stars of democracy on the box.

Even though the corporate video and related services area may be growing, actual jobs are still difficult to come by," cautions Challenger. 
So far there has been a good response from local firms and bodies offering placements, which range from <tag "510839">modest</> corporate video production companies to BBC Television in Birmingham.   

800241
The General knew he would probably die, for infantry took pleasure in killing cavalry and he would be the leading horseman in the attack on the bridge, but the General was a soldier and he had long learned that a soldier's real enemy is the fear of death. 
Beat that fear and victor was certain, and victory brought glory and fame and medals and money and, best of all, sweetest of all, most glorious and wondrous of all, the <tag "510838?">modest</> teasing grin of a short black-haired Emperor who would pat the Dragoon General as though he was a faithful dog, and the thought of that Imperial favour made the General quicken his horse and raise his battered sword. 

800242
The Labour motion condemned government policies for producing the worst teacher shortage crisis since the early 1970s, and called for emergency measures to halt the drain of teachers by improving their morale and rewards and to guarantee that no child is without permanent qualified teaching this September. 
An amendment in the name of the Prime Minister applauded the Government's energetic programme to tackle teacher shortages, and welcomed the increased numbers of initial training places. 
It contrasted substantial improvements in teachers" pay under the Tories with the `<tag "510839">modest</>" increase under Labour, and urged local education authorities to use the flexibility available to them to recruit and retain sufficient, well-qualified teachers. 

800243
The associated investment in production and marketing gave the trading houses commanding positions within African economies. 
In 1982 the total stock of that investment in Africa was estimated at about $13 billion, with over half of it still concentrated in the production and export of primary commodities. 
Since 1976, the flow of new investment has been very <tag "510839">modest</>, and in some years negative.   

800244
Harris was presented with the best chance of the game when a superb run and cross by Adam Murray left him with an open goal. 
Harris converted the cross: but unfortunately into the soccer goal behind and just to one side of the hockey goal directly in front of him and after the match he protested that he had got the two goal frames mixed up! 
WITNEY'S <tag "510922?">modest</> season came to a close with two matches at RAF Brize Norton.   

800245
Its proposal is extremely simple: extend the personal equity plan to assets other than equities, and put an annual limit on the amount that can be moved into the scheme each year. 
This would allow the saver of <tag "510839">modest</> means to shelter all his savings within a few years, while ensuring that only a small proportion of any large fortune escapes tax.   

800246
We have already discussed the need for central funding of high-risk projects having potentially broad application within the firm. 
The amount of the funding required for this purpose is generally quite <tag "510839">modest</>, but it can provide significant leverage in accelerating strategic innovations.

800250
The Livis were a working-class family of peasant origin and Ivo had to leave school before he was 12 years old to become a barber's assistant and, eventually, a metalworker. 
His devotion to American movies led him to seek an escape route through a career in entertainment and he began as a gawky 17-year-old impersonating Chevalier and Donald Duck in Marseilles nightclubs. 
In his <tag "510841">modest</>, almost nondescript, ground-floor flat in Paris, Montand looks more like a businessman than a cinema legend.

That will be put up by CIN Venture Managers, the venture capital arm of the British Coal and British Rail pension funds, but the MCD management will be given incentives with rights to buy up to 10 per cent of the company in the future. 
The initial consideration of #43m &dash. #39.5m in cash and #3.5m in loan notes, bearing rolled-up interest at Libor &dash. is remarkable for having a debt to equity ratio of only 1.8 to 1, which is extremely <tag "510839">modest</> in the light of other buyouts.

And in his reply, he complimented Mrs Thatcher on having made an `immense contribution" to the Rhodesia settlement. 
`Uncharacteristically," he teased her, `you have been much too <tag "510840">modest</>."

Increasing the productivity of the technical staff offers the obvious benefit of reducing development costs; it also offers the less obvious advantage of permitting smaller teams to complete a given task within a limited elapsed time. 
Although it is probably true that major productivity gains will come only through basic methodological changes (as represented by fourth-generation tools), it is nonetheless true that some worthwhile improvements can also be made in the use of conventional procedural languages. 
These languages will continue for a number of years to soak up an important fraction of the development effort in most organizations, and so even a <tag "510839">modest</> increase in productivity carries a high payoff.   

800254
This would be true, for example, if an unnecessarily rejected order carries a high cost in lost profit, or if an unexpected delivery delay causes serious customer ill will (and hence the loss of future sales and profits). 
In many inventory systems, however, the payoff from avoiding an (occasional) error may be fairly <tag "510839">modest</>.

Then he said that the movement was trying to do away with an era of lies, and that it would be wrong to build a new era on a new set of lies. 
A good intervention, although the Leipzig crowd would dearly have loved to believe the other speakers' stories, which included a million dollars in Switzerland, in gold, silver and platinum. 
But there is enough coming out from the provinces to satisfy that part of the popular appetite for scandal &dash. and anyway, a million dollars in Switzerland seems a rather <tag "510839">modest</> amount.   

800256
City have tradition as well as bricks and mortar in their favour. 
Runners-up to Newcastle in the League in 1907, and losing finalists to Manchester United in the FA Cup two years later, they were in the First Division as recently as 1980. 
Rovers, whose transfer record is still the <tag "510839">modest</> #100,000 they paid Birmingham for Stewart Barrowclough in 1979, have never finished higher than sixth in the Second Division &dash. a peak reached in 1956 and again three years later.   

800257
The average wage in 1950 (#6. 8s. 0d.) had almost doubled by 1959 (#11. 2s. 6d.) but by then the pound had lost a third of its value. 
This was only a <tag "510839">modest</> puff of inflation by subsequent standards: by 1974 the 1950 pound would have been worth only onethird of a pound.   

800258
Although there is disagreement in the City over whether recession is inevitable, there were warnings yesterday that high rates could reduce package holiday bookings by as much as 40 per cent next summer &dash. something that would help to narrow the current account deficit. 
THE HALIFAX, Britain's biggest building society, yesterday attempted to stem a wholesale move to 15 per cent mortgage rates by announcing a comparatively <tag "510839">modest</> 1-point hike in its own lending rate to 14.5 per cent.   

800259
BR insiders acknowledge Mr Reid as a tough and persuasive operator, but nevertheless a `second eleven player" compared with some of the high-flyers linked to the post such as Sir Colin Marshall, chief executive of British Airways.

For example the sport of crown green bowling, which was very little known outside of the north of England, has been shown to a wider public; the greens are often oddly bereft of spectators, and the northern accents of the players are plainly audible as they urge on their woods or confer solemnly as a pair over the last bowl of an important `end".

In choosing which functions to include as primitives (and hence, by exclusion, what the user must otherwise program in more detailed form), designers of a modeling language must trade off the perceived convenience of being able to invoke a rich variety of powerful primitives versus the added cost and complexity of learning to use a comprehensive language. 
Many of the fancy functions that look good in sales literature may seldom be used, and yet they generally impose a psychological hurdle on learning the language. 
Any model of even <tag "510839">modest</> complexity requires the specification of conditional relationships that define the value of a variable based on the value of other variables.

The support of the client co-operative, the local planning authority and the earlier experience at St James's, Knatchbull Road, helped to persuade the Housing Corporation to fund the scheme. 
Quite independent of the social merits of re-using a redundant building to provide comfortable dwellings for local people at <tag "510839">modest</> rents, a main factor encouraging the retention of All Saints Church was the value accorded by the local authority planners to the building for its contribution to the townscape.

The caddis chooses its stones carefully, rejecting those that are too large or too small for the current gap in the wall, even rotating each stone until it achieves the snuggest fit. 
Incidentally, why does this impress us so? 
If we forced ourselves to think in a detached way we surely ought to be more impressed by the architecture of the caddis's eye, or of its elbow joint, than by the comparatively <tag "510841">modest</> architecture of its stone house.

Some academic estimates suggest that the bill means that interest rates could be higher for the next 40 years than otherwise would have been necessary. 
Credit analysts Standard and Poor's, using much more <tag "510839">modest</> numbers, argued this week that the financing needs of the Savings and Loans `are certain to affect the capital markets."

Then at last he said: `Gentlemen &dash. and ladies, pardon me &dash. I have given much thought to these matters and I wish to say here in confidence to you, that while there remains between myself and many of those present differences of interpretation as to what is really occurring in Europe at this moment, despite this, as to the main points that have been raised in this house, I am convinced, gentlemen, convinced both of their justice and their practicality." 
A murmur which seemed to contain both relief and triumph went around the table, but this time M. Dupont raised his voice slightly and pronounced over it: `I am happy to assure you all here that I will bring what <tag "510839">modest</> influence I have to encourage certain changes of emphasis in French policy in accordance with much of what has been said here.

I recall listening to him tell it to visitors when I was a child, and then later, when I was starting out as a footman under his supervision. 
I remember him relating it again the first time I returned to see him after gaining my first post as butler &dash. to a Mr and Mrs Muggeridge in their relatively <tag "510841">modest</> house in Allshot, Oxfordshire.

But does it? 
Philip Chappell, adviser to the Investment Trust Association is convinced that section 153 of the Companies Act, which allows companies to give a <tag "510839">modest</> degree of assistance to their shareholders, permits companies to subsidise a share-dealing service for private shareholders.

This, together with his membership of the Athenaeum and the Beefsteak show how much he was liked and respected. 
Quiet and <tag "510838">modest</> in manner, speaking with an occasional stutter, his initiative, absolute reliability and willingness to help in the humblest duties endeared him to his many friends, not only in the literary world.

Ahidjo retreated into bitterness and the heavy drinking and cigarette-smoking which no doubt shortened his life.

This means they cannot compete with one another, but have to co-operate to handle international traffic. 
The CCITT also recommends that international private circuits should not be allowed to carry public traffic, which prevents private companies undercutting the cartel.

In the north west, it was astonishing to see this superstar, namely Morrissey, worshipping this formerly dreadful local TV presenter. 
Thankfully, Margi Clarke had evolved from her <tag "510842">modest</> beginnings into a very fine actress indeed.

There had been Churchills in Oxfordshire long before, and it is highly probable that they took their name from the attractive little village on the fringe of the Cotswolds. 
There were Churchills in Banbury in the 15th century but these early links are tenuous; there are gaps in the records (often the case from those times) and the author is content, modestly, to trace his ancestry in the direct male line, only to Thomas of Arncot, who flourished in the days of James I. 
They began as yeoman farmers of <tag "510839">modest</> means, thrifty, hard-working folk who tended to marry young and have large families (one enjoyed the bounty of three sets of twins as well as others who arrived singly); but they prospered with each succeeding generation, acquiring increasing status in the community and additional wealth as the years went by.

Lists of the best writers, prepared by committees or individual pundits usually omit Beckett.

The Wiltshire club are also considering a firm approach for Cardiff's manager Frank Burrows after being refused permission by Bristol Rovers to talk to Gerry Francis. 
ANDY LLOYD and Paul Smith had their bats stolen at Trent Bridge but took an admirably firm grip on the replacements, writes Jack Massarik. 
Lloyd reached 100 not out with Chris Broad's bat and Smith, with a second-choice bat, a thigh strain and a runner, made 47 to steer Warwickshire 69 runs ahead of Nottinghamshire's <tag "510839">modest</> first-innings total of 147.

Indeed, apparently traditional flail-threshing barns continued to be built throughout the nineteenth century because of their ability to house the threshing machine as well as the crops. 
In contrast, adoption of the second policy guaranteed the disappearance of many old barns because they became redundant unless they were retained as covered rick-houses or stores for straw. 
However, the protection of hay, straw or even unthreshed corn was more simply achieved by the erection of a more <tag "510841">modest</> and inexpensive building than the traditional flail-threshing barn.

For example, two properties of orthodox houses which are particularly apparent are the cellular plan and load-bearing masonry construction. 
A disused industrial or commercial building which it is intended to convert into dwellings may exhibit neither of these features. 
Thus the informed lay person's judgement, which may be a satisfactory assessment of the integrity and solidity of a <tag "510841">modest</> conventional house, may be a wildly inaccurate appraisal of the soundness of a more specialised building.

In a squeezy market, short of stock, shares romped ahead, helped by a late rumour that a big takeover bid would be rolled out today.

The loudest applause came when he announced $15 million in aid to help clean the historic city of Cracow, and again when he said Poland's friends in the US wanted the country to be `free, prosperous, democratic and independent." 
His <tag "510839">modest</> offer of US bilateral aid, in addition to Cracow's $15 million, amounted to a $100 million fund to act as seed money for the fledgling private sector of the Polish economy.

THIS week has been a good one for Mike Gregory.

That came to nothing. 
Then came the visions of the late Sixties: an ultra-radical Communism of workers' councils exploding out of decrepit post-Stalinism, glittering for an instant from the mighty workers' rising on the Baltic in 1970. 
Then the <tag "510971">modest</> hopes for Eurocommunism, Italian style: hopes ended with a bang for Mr Dubcek and with a whimper in Western Europe in the course of the next decade.

They wanted their due share of the great economic decision-making portfolios, their due weight in Canadian national policies. 
Nothing could have been more to my taste. 
As a CCFer, as a Canadian Congress of Labour official, as a consistent, vocal, even turbulent opponent of Duplessis and all his works, I not only welcomed the changes: I took a <tag "510839">modest</> part in them.

It is a truism that the law of defamation in a modern democratic society is dominated by the need to balance its solicitude for individual reputation against the public's interest in freedom of speech and access to information and opinion, especially on matters of public concern. 
The complexity of the contemporary English law not only harbours surviving relics of an earlier political culture but reflects continuous efforts over more than a century to readjust that balance by patchwork legislation and <tag "510839">modest</> judicial innovations.

But ali of these organizational initiatives stopped well short of full-blooded state intervention. 
Even the Physical Training and Recreation Act of 1937, which made funds available to promote fitness amidst rumours of war and the realities of domestic rearmament, was exceedingly <tag "510839">modest</> in scope with a meagre two-million-pound budget in comparison with the vast sums spent on `Kraft durch Freude" by the Third Reich and Mussolini's `Dopolavoro" programme.

In the final position, the game was adjourned, but White's extra pawn is no longer enough to win. 
`I THINK the artists are at the head of the restructuring drive," says Yuri Khilchevsky, the Soviet deputy minister of culture, as he sips his lemon tea.

As a result of this, certain big Renoir prints are expensive &dash. over #20,000 for the kind of lithograph which looks like a chalk drawing.

By no means all leases come under these provisions. 
For a tenant to claim the benefits of the Act he must show that his tenancy is of a house, that it was originally granted for more than twenty-one years, that the rent payable is less than two-thirds of its rateable value, and that the rateable value is itself not in excess of certain <tag "510839">modest</> limits.

Liffe is also likely to steal a march on Globex, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's electronic trading system now the victim of the ancient rivalry with the Chicago Board of Trade.

The texts Obst had chosen &dash. testaments of ill-fortune from the late Middle Ages, were lively and strong, here given settings that frequently used, in cross-cut style, the oscillating triple-time dance figures and syncopated drones of French folk music. 
With their clean and well-articulated textures and their lightness of touch, these songs paid convincing if <tag "510839">modest</> tribute to the poems and showed technical skill &dash. but remained a bit pretentious and cute.

But the very style and underlying tendency of his philosophy should also be taken into account. 
From the start, his dispassionate programme of coolly observing human nature at work, and his <tag "510971?">modest</> Newtonian aim of finding some few systematizing principles, which themselves are taken at face value and left unexplained, mark him out as someone reluctant to go beyond experience, and wary of approaching the world with preconceived theories.
