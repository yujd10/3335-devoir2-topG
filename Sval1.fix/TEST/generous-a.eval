Man Ray, born Emmanuel Radnitzky of Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia in 1890, renounced deep family and ethnic ties in his allegiance to the cult of absolute artistic freedom. 
Paradoxically, his fame as the almost hypnotic photo-portrayer of the leading artistic figures around him, his novel solarisations, rayographs and cliches de verre (the last two cameraless manipulations of light and chemistry alone), and his original work for Vogue and Harper's became a diamond-studded albatross about the neck of a man who wanted to be recognised, first and foremost, as a painter.

The third concert, of Brahms's Third and First symphonies, revealed the new Karajan at his most lovable, for these were natural, emotional, and &dash.  let the word escape at last &dash. profound interpretations: voyages of discovery; loving traversals of familiar, exciting ground with a fresh eye and mind, in the company of someone prepared to linger here, to exclaim there; summations towards which many of his earlier, less intimate performances of the works had led. 
Karajan had pitched camp with Legge and the Philharmonia in 1949 when a <tag>generous</> grant from the Maharaja of Mysore had stabilized the orchestra's finances and opened up the possibility, in collaboration with EMI, of extensive recording, not only of the classic repertory but of works that caught Karajan's and Legge's fancy: Balakirev's First Symphony, Roussel's Fourth Symphony, the still formidably difficult Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta by Barto&acute.k, and some English music, too.

My husband and I have a small house and two children at local schools, while their children go to expensive private schools.

It might be true of unadventurous works like Le Dernier Metro; but La Chambre Verte, or the underrated Les Deux Anglaises et le Continent, are harrassed and restless films which bear comparison with what he called the `frightful melancholy" of Jules et Jim.

Tony Gordon's Kiwis, who will now find it difficult to go through the remainder of their tour undefeated, are not as tight and efficient a force as Graham Lowe's team of four years ago, but with a virtual Test side out, should have been far too strong for Murphy's collection of reserves.

Ingrid Kirby, of Postel Investment Management, asked: `Was it really necessary to offer incoming management such a large incentive in the company?"

Power such as the pair have accrued creates the possibility of abuse, and there are tales of troubles encountered by those who do not fit in which are rather hard to square with Albert Roux's genuine liking for ambitious youth. 
When asked about training, he said he could teach discipline and technique, but never taste, which had to be an innate gift, and went on to say how much he admired the way Raymond Blanc and Nico Ladenis had developed this gift. 
The <tag>generous</> view would be that the brothers have never quite lost that garrison mentality (by all accounts, anyone who believed in good food in the Sixties felt under siege) and find it easier to trust those whose loyalty is proven.   

700109
If Charlie had been a different man, a cultivated man or effeminate or living in a bygone age when tongues were more freely unloosed, he might now have embraced Jack and told him from a full heart how he entered wholly into his joy and would die for his happiness. 
And if Jack had been such another he would have thanked Charlie for his unstinted friendship, his <tag>generous</> loans, his hospitality and for bringing him Marilyn Thompson.

`At the end of that," she asks, `how could I justify getting upset at a duffed shot?" 
On the course, she stands out for her softly, rather than aggressively, spiked hair, a finish with the driver which, like Arnold Palmer's, tells you precisely how much she has given to the shot, and an unusually <tag>generous</> attitude towards the opposition.   

700113

It transpired that as a result of my screams, the editor's secretary rushed in. 
Her howls, before she fainted beside me, brought another secretary who testified that Mike was kneeling by my body, tears rolling down his cheeks as he moaned `My God, I've killed him,"" writes Cyril. 
`He later gave me large scotches and made the most <tag>generous</> gesture of contrition to a non-golfer that he could think of: `If you like, I'll let you caddy for me at Walton Heath on Sunday.""

His friends remember the man behind the legend more than the impressive list of Himalayan summits he had conquered. 
In spite of his rows of medals, interviews with King Birendra of Nepal, and his work at the Ministry of Tourism, Sungdare Sherpa remained largely unimpressed by his own fame, remaining loyal to friends with whom he had shared the hardships of starting as a young unknown in Kathmandu. 
He was expansively <tag>generous</>, sometimes, while returning from yet another successful expedition, giving away valuable equipment or his earnings to friends he met on the way.

But in May the two companies formally opened talks again, and yesterday Stead chairman, Peter Gee, said the combined group would benefit from Clayform's property expertise and Stead's retail experience. 
The increased offer, at #21.55 per ordinary share and #1.52 per `A" share, represents a premium over the group's net asset value &dash. something last year's less <tag>generous</> offer did not.

Reason may `pave the way for such a sentiment", for it may point out unnoticed features or consequences of an action and help us to compare and contrast it with others, but ultimately our praise and blame is a matter of emotion, feeling, or sentiment. 
For one thing, `what is honourable, what is fair, what is becoming, what is noble, what is <tag>generous</>, takes possession of the heart", and reason cannot do this.   

700119
The standard rate benefited from an increase of just 40p, taking it from #52.10 to #52.50. 
The argument which has been put forward for these changes is that there are nowadays many occupational sick pay schemes which are supposed to benefit the better paid employee &dash. hence the minimal increase in the rate. 
Lower paid employees are generally less likely to be covered by occupational schemes and so they have benefited from a <tag>generous</> increase.

She's on the menu too, as Steak Greta, a sort of Scandinavian hamburger. 
Reactions to Garbo's may include: admiration that an English chef can cook food authentic enough to convince at least some expatriates; curiosity about some of the dishes that are ambassadors of Swedish home-cooking, such as Samson's Temptation or Kaldomar, cabbage leaves stuffed with minced pork and beef; impatience at the occasionally slow, though rarely unfriendly service. 
A fixed-price lunch may include a very unpleasant cheesecake and a seriously overcooked Samson's Temptation where the shredded potato, instead of being suffused with cream and spiked with sweet-cured anchovy, is burnt, dry and crusty, but it can also yield an incredibly <tag>generous</> portion of smoked eel (rather more Danish than Swedish).

Lucas is establishing an important position in higher value added automotive technology in fields such as anti-lock brakes, engine management systems and petrol injectors while its aerospace component operation is picking up on a rising civil aircraft production programme. 
Lucas shares nipped up 15p to 616p yesterday in the wake of a 28 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to #187.1m in the year to 31 July where the taxman has been more benign and the dividend payout more <tag>generous</> than expected.

Contact a Family have found that there is a move amongst Health Authorities to increase the age at which they provide free nappies for children with special needs because they argue that children without special needs use nappies at night until they are 4 or 5. 
Contact a Family want to amass independent evidence that children are usually clean and dry at night younger than this so that they can put the case for more <tag>generous</> help for handicapped children.

The second objection to the use of Finland as a model for Eastern Europe is that the Finnish brand of democratic socialism is unlikely to be the preferred one. 
Nordic traditions of social consensus, high taxes and <tag>generous</> levels of welfare spending, all under-pinned by efficient private industry, could not readily be transferred with success (though Austria offers a similar example which is nearer at hand).

Glossy Kodak-yellow drainage-pipes festooned the countryside, looped and stacked in  farmyards, overflowing from the innards of barns, lurking in trailers, and piled in PVC coils in the fields, like gigantic canary-coloured worm-casts.

Beside the pipes in some places were stored or heeled into the ground <tag>generous</> quantities of young trees and shrubs ready for planting.

The massive de La Grange Mahler biography was then only in embryo. 
At de La Grange's converted monastery in Corsica, guests for summer breaks in 1971 and 1972 included Xenakis and his wife, Pierre Henry the musique concrete composer, and the Marchise Yvonne de Casa-Fuerte who talked of `mon ami Francis Poulenc" at every possible juncture, but was a <tag>generous</> supporter of new music.

In that campaign, which he ended with a score of 221, he also rode the fastest 100 by a jump jockey, smashed Jonjo O'Neill's record seasonal total of 149, and not only became the first man to ride 200 winners over jumps, but the first to do so under either code since Sir Gordon Richards did so on the Flat in 1952.

Hamburg enjoys an extremely high level of film subsidy &dash. approximately #6 million a year, or three times the sum available in Britain. 
This generosity is, it seems, partly due to regional rivalry.

New Zealand were making only their second visit to Post Office Road, Featherstone's one previous tour match against the Kiwis in 1955 having ended in defeat by a single point. 
Ian Smales gave the home side brief hope with an eighth-minute penalty, but two minutes later, when Kurt Sherlock gave Morvin Edwards a <tag>generous</> overlap for the Kiwis' opening try, there was little danger of the final score being anything like as close.

Rarely, however, have these two benefits been so effectively  combined as in the new DOUBLE PAYOUT PLAN from Reader's Digest. 
Traditionally, life insurance policies have been geared to either  protection or investment, rarely to both.

The Royal Ballet is notorious for its ragged footwear and the sight of the four little swans machine-stitching their way across the stage in tatty, old shoes can be heartbreaking. 120 pairs a year may sound like a lot but is nothing to the 350 or so regularly destroyed by some American ballerinas. 
Although the Friends of Covent Garden were the first with the idea of how to meet the cost of shoeing their dancers, Britain's other ballet companies also have huge shoe bills to meet. 
The English National Ballet's 32 female dancers have a <tag>generous</> allocation of 20 pairs per month and an annual bill of over #45,000.

Caldecott joined Hutchinson in 1982, and from 1984 edited the esoteric Rider imprint. 
This suited his taste but the dissolution of Wildwood seemed to have diminished the man.

He said he took account of the principle that there should be `freedom to concentrate help to those in need". 
He added: `In our change of policy to concentrate help on those most in need through family credit, we provided last year #200m extra for low income families, #100m for normal working families through income support and this year an extra #70m over and above the uprating of benefit.

After trying to think of more bad ways in which a person could be like any kind of potato, she went on, standing in the middle of the sitting-room, holding herself together as if she was cold, `Isn't it terrible how when you find out more about someone you've known a long time and thought you knew all about, they're always worse than you thought before, never not as bad?

National trade unions, too, have long been aware of the frustrations of negotiations at `local" level when the real decisions are taken thousands of miles away. 
The other side of the coin is that the giants will spawn a new generation of `service" companies, whose numbers will make it difficult and expensive to police such issues as health and safety. 
One reason the Western trade unions have been <tag>generous</> with in helping the independent trade unions in Eastern Europe is that they do not want to see multinationals exploit the less well organised labour there at the expense of jobs in the West.

These could include acaena, dwarf dianthus, sedum and thyme, but as an alternative cover the soil between plants with a two-inch layer of chipped bark or peat.

Had it not been for the influx of American capital during the 1960s, British filmmakers might have thought harder at the time about ways to restructure their industry.
