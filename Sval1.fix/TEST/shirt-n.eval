But as I located the Bug's earlier unhappiness I also remembered something else: a mezzo-soprano in my theory class at Eastman with a very hearty rich laugh, but a laugh whose component `hahs" of mirth, if removed from the many `hah-hahs" on either side of them in the descending series, would have sounded like wails of inconsolable remorse; and I felt a surge of pity toward this mezzo-soprano (though I had not really known her and had no idea what she was doing now &dash. probably being successful in some small opera company), because her laugh represented what I now thought life was like for people who were single and without a family. 
I felt a huge near-miss sort of relief, not quite complacence yet but approaching it, to be established, with an apartment, with this Bug in my arms, with this sweater on and wife who had picked it out, and I felt that though I had not proven to be a composer or a horn player, and was in fact making an unimpressive living as a part-time technical writer and reviewer of TV commercials, and would never write a scholarly history of the comma, I was nonetheless doing all right. 
Of course I had never finished the symphonic poem that was to begin with the peanut butter jar &dash. I never even got beyond noting that first accented quarter note halfway down a blank piece of music paper, below the tuba line and above the strings (a quarter note without the normal oval bulb at the end but rather the X that in percussion scoring sometimes indicates pitchless indeterminacy, and recalls too the Xs that once stood for eyes in newspaper cartoons of dead people and rag dolls), and it was true that ever since I had transferred from Eastman and my musical proficiencies and ambitions had faded, and I had stopped listening to Debussy and carrying a tuning fork around in my <tag>shirt</> pocket in order to make random objects amplify its unworldly A, my life, like the flaring sheet of water that once in a while will unexpectedly fly up out of the sink if, as you are rinsing some dishes, you allow the tap's strong singular flow to fall accidentally onto a spoon licked clean and left there earlier so that the water is U-turned without an appreciable diminution of force by that single small soffit &dash. that my life, my energies, colliding with the silver spoon of overindulged distraction, had sent me since   

700002
Chay became an American hero. 
His picture appeared twice a month on the cover of the National Enquirer, the newspaper of national record, on <tag>T-shirts</> and breakfast-food packages, and he seemed to live on television news programmes and talk shows.   

700003
Heading out to the start in Jimmy's van, we saw tell-tale road markings; it must be more than 10K! 
Despite the billing on the <tag>T-shirts</> we were told, as we interrupted the jouvert (dawn fiesta) to line up beside Scotty's Bar, that it was 20K.   

700004
This spring, trousers are making a big comeback, walking into even the most formal occasions. 
Worn with crisp white <tag>shirts</> under loosely tailored jackets, in classic shades of navy, white and neutral, these are the creases to bare. 

700005
They have been using a portable cabin as changing rooms while building work is being done to the Manor.

700006
I confess our exchange was still preying on the old bean when I called in on Harry's Christmas, a seasonal offering from friend Berkoff, and found that he had strayed sartorially. 
Not a <tag>shirt</> stud or cuff link in sight.  

700007
And if musicals are what move you, there is no shortage of presents. 
Dress Circle (Monmouth Street, London WC2, 01-240 2257) sells <tag>T-shirts</> and mugs with emblems of all the big ones, and jewellery such as Oscar earrings ( #85, 14-carat gold) and pendants ( #45, 14-carat gold) and delicate little phantom-mask earrings ( #24.95, 9-carat gold).   

700008

700009
`We'll be back when you see us. 
We'll be back before night anyhow," he said as he tucked his <tag>shirt</> into his trousers, hoisting them round his hips.   

700010
Tell them I'm looking forward to it." 
When February came he dressed for the premiere in a mood of heavy indecision, unable to choose between two different, new <tag>shirts</>, between gold or pearl studs and white or yellow braces, while his valet's patience was eroded to something close to irritability.  

700012
Jo had smiled and said nothing. 
Her mother had been promising more time in the future all her life. 
In the full brilliance of the late Jamaican morning, Jo and Richard, in swimming costumes and <tag>T-shirts</>, made their way barefoot down the board stairway to the shade of the canopy halfway down the cliff. 

700013
United have a hard core of 40,000, could pack in 70,000 on big match days if the stadium could cope with such a number. 
From dawn on Saturday mornings coaches leave from all parts of England (I once came up with the Southampton Red Devils, leaving at 5.30) to journey to Old Trafford filled with devotees who, certainly in recent years, have been well-behaved. 
They are prepared to spend a big proportion of mostly small wages, and spend up to 12 hours on a bus, in order to watch the blood-red <tag>shirts</> for 90 minutes.

700015
A successful match man can win more than #10,000 a year, an income which has attracted the prying fingers of the Inland Revenue. 
Sometimes, this cash comes from sponsors, who know that such fishermen will wear <tag>T-shirts</> or stick labels on their windscreens bearing the backer's name as long as the colours are bright.   

700016
His thin, sensitive, rather striking face bore a network of fine wrinkles. 
Behind him stood a skinny youth of about twenty, bizarrely attired in baggy yellow trousers and a pink and blue striped <tag>T-shirt</>.   

700017
OK, maybe it seems harsh, but I don't think I'm the only one who gets slightly bugged by dropouts trying to make me feel like I'm insensitive and uncaring if I don't pay for their drink. 
The inside was crusty-free and the <tag>T-shirts</> were #7, which seems quite reasonable. 

700018
So a pat on the back goes to designers for coming up with children's wear for autumn and winter that's sensible, yet stylish enough to turn grown-ups green with envy. 
Boys look the business in a batch of futuristic (for that, parents, read easy-care) fabrics, in sharp, computer colours of acid yellow, orange, and lime. 
Hardwearing twill trousers, striped <tag>shirts</>, embroidered denim and emblem sweatshirts are all tailormade to combat the rough and tumble of everyday action.  

700019
`No one could be stupider than us," I said. 
`You, for instance, have a penguin on your <tag>T-shirt</>.   

700021
This seemed the start of the rot (for us snobs). 
Bowlers &and. brollies were added to this outfit &dash. and in out-of-synch areas far from London, kids wore mixtures of suedehead hair, check <tag>shirts</>, Sta-Prests, boots, bowlers &and. brollies.   

700023
It helps if you've got the right equipment on the end," he added of Tony Cascarino and Niall Quinn.

700024
His dark eyes, wide open and strangely like those of a sleepwalker, were unblinking and clearly visible. 
They did not gleam or glow: he walked with a graceful slow stride, very slim, the white sleeves of his <tag>shirt</> uncurling on his arms.   

700025
Even married women need a career, everyone knows it," says Ella to Annabel. 
`You, at least, as a single girl, don't have to pick up their pyjamas, brush their suits and iron their <tag>shirts</>."   

700026
The unspoken words trembled in the air. 
Then Marcus stood up and began to unbutton his <tag>shirt</> further.   

700028
A good proportion of Hungarians were among the substantial numbers who attended. 
The gypsy element of the music, in spite of being flamboyantly represented in its nineteenth-century cliche form by the impressive Antal Szalai Gypsy Band, was difficult to pin down. 
Szalai's 13-piece group (seven violins, two clarinets, double-bass, cello, flute and cimbalom; the players in blue embroidered waistcoats, floppy white <tag>shirts</> and sideburns) is one of only a handful of its size &dash. there are dozens of smaller groups playing in Budapest restaurants such as Matyas Pince.

700031
`I'm still not as tall as Dad, and Andrew's nearly as tall as I am already." 
They were passing a looking-glass, and he paused to check his appearance and brush a few dog hairs from the cuffs of his jacket. 
His new evening <tag>shirt</>, fine white lawn pintucked and starched to perfection, was his own design and, he thought, well worth the unction he had been obliged to pour on the shirtmaker to get it made exactly as he wanted it.   

700032
It is utterly charming and so unsophisticated. 
Her grandfather carved it from a single piece of pear wood; its arms and legs are made of string, its <tag>shirt</> is just an old scrap of pyjama. 

700035
`Don't cry." 
He drew her closer, the softness of her breasts against his <tag>shirt</> stirring all the desire he had ever felt for her. 

700036
The children shout to each vehicle to stop near them. 
The old men in their check <tag>shirts</> and berets try to look as if they have seen it all before, but their eyes gleam too. 

700037
That lovely natural smile was also on display again. 
It was a little insensitive perhaps that the tournament's brightest young things were banished to an outside court, but a bonus for those fans without show-court tickets who form that snaking queue outside in the mornings. 
The <tag>T-shirt</> seller with the `Where's Andre" number was not doing much business with yesterday's queue, for Chang and Sanchez have made people forget about the absent Agassi.   

700038
The body was at the foot of a flight of steps at the New Road end of the lane which leads towards George Street. 
A wristwatch was lying close to the dead man, who was dressed in a dinner jacket, and a cufflink had also come off his <tag>shirtsleeve</>. 

700039
Mohicans also gained popularity. 
Only the boots, jeans and braces were revived, no suits were worn.

700040
The pace is utterly manic, the bickering relentless and the colour lurid; to some The Simpsons is a half-hour headache. 
No UK broadcast date has been fixed, but Sky are picking it up for autumn., In the meantime, Bart is appearing in bootlegged form on American dance flyers and <tag>T-shirts</> everywhere.  

700041
The dressing chest has hanging cupboards on either side of six spacious drawers. 
The gentlemen's dressing chest has the same appearance as the six-drawer chest, but with a lift-up lid and drop-down front revealing a mirror, small drawers and recesses for cufflinks and collar studs. 
The linen press comprises a four-drawer chest, surmounted with a cupboard containing three pull-out trays designed to hold linens, but equally suitable for <tag>shirts</> and pullovers. 

700043
Postcards, far from being thrust on one at every corner, are hard to find. 
Islam has its own exoticism: in all but the biggest towns (at least towards the north) the men wear full beards, a baggy <tag>shirt</> and trousers and a rich variety of headgear.   

700045
At yesterday's session in the sylvan setting of Brisbane Boys College, Teague appeared to have made a strong recovery from his shoulder injury while the Welsh centre, John Devereux still looked short of a yard of pace due to his injured ankle. 
Towards the end of the session it became clear substantial changes were being contemplated, when the red <tag>shirts</>, usually worn by the first XV, were organised into a separate unit.   

700046
A few months ago, I went to school like any other girl. 
In the morning I would find myself putting on a <tag>T-shirt</>, a pair of tight pants and baseball boots, without any thought.

Best buys in the West: Bavarian style slippers, for sale in a Ku'Damm shoe shop, decorated with logos like `I love ecology" and `I like seals".

She was attacked by a man who pulled her to the ground and indecently assaulted her in a car park in nearby Oxpens Road.

He was wearing a light-coloured tweed jacket, a white-collared <tag>shirt</> and smart, dark trousers.   

700049
The boy was curled against him, his legs drawn up, his hands touchingly folded, his head lying now between Michael's shoulder and the back of the seat. 
The white laundered <tag>shirt</> hung open almost to his waist. 

700050
I didn't only live in the past. 
I daydreamed about current acquaintances, and sometimes about men I didn't even know: the cheerful blond kid of about seventeen who loaded my grocery bags at Davidson's and always offered to take them right to my home for me, or anywhere else; the muscular man in the tight <tag>T-shirts</> who serviced my Volvo and was also lavish with friendly extra-auto suggestions.   

700051
Sometimes I look through the catalogue at the men's clothes, or wander into shops like Principles and look at the menswear. 
If I could afford it, I would buy some of their <tag>shirts</> and casual clothes, because often they're much better made than the stuff for girls.   

700052
I was pulled away, still kicking and gouging in the approved fashion. 
Bernard, tucking in his <tag>shirt</>, scrambled up the bank of The Drain and ran towards the flat horizon. 

700053
They were pale and unkempt. 
They wore <tag>T-shirts</>, and swapped jokes about the task in hand: banging wooden stakes into the ground to support steps they were carving in the soil.   

700054
She is wearing vest, pants, tights. 
`Sorry," he says, struggling out of his jacket, wrenching at his tie, tearing off his <tag>shirt</>. 

700055
And will the sartorially-conscious supporter have to pay for a new wardrobe in which to battle the carabinieri? 
The present England shirt costs about #24.99 for a full-sized fan, but the little number that saw us through (and its red going-away alternative) is beginning to reek from all those coach trips, nights spent in railway stations and sweaty terrace pens. 
Football couturiers are critical of the rather plebian collar, the <tag>shirt's</> tailored lines, and the overall failure of a style designed in 1986 to reflect today's less structured look.   

700056
The security guards all wanted them!" 
`And I was walking past the <tag>T-shirt</> stall and this girl I know who does Jesus Jones' T-shirts ran over to me and said, This guy wants to talk to you &dash. he wants to talk to you &dash. he wants to buy the rights for that T-shirt and put them in the shops!   

700057
A tweed jacket with a toning waistcoat for casual country elegance. 
A floral <tag>shirt</> softens this masculine look and a riding skirt flatters fuller figures. 

700058
If the body is the temple of Christ, then Dowdeswell's must have been downgraded to the status of outside toilet by now. 
He has carved some sort of career out of breaking records for eating , on separate occasions, obscene quantities of eels, gherkins, meat-pies, pizza, sausage and sushi in record time. 
You see him occasionally, as the `fun", `uplifting" item at the end of the regional news scoffing pies in Halesowen sporting a side-parting and a food-encrusted t <tag>shirt</>.   

700059
Under this circumstance he felt that his photograph in the Beckett T-shirt would have been improper. 
I can't help thinking that Samuel Beckett, the high priest of absurdity, would be very amused by the choice Havel was facing and by his solution of the problem: he refused to co-operate not because of the possibly endangered dignity of his future office but because of the possible lese-majesty of Death. 
As for Havel's own sense of the absurd, in one of the television interviews he granted at the time when he had that <tag>T-shirt</> problem, he said: `I am constantly conscious of the ridiculousness and absurdity of my situation.   

700060

For years Phoebe had slept in baggy <tag>T-shirts</>.   

700062
They knew Jo Forbes very well by then, but did not care for the strange-looking older man who escorted her. 
About half the men were dressed with reassuring formality, in dark suits and striped <tag>shirts</>, including Corinna's escort, Nicky Brompton, whom the porter acknowledged with obsequious discretion because he had visited another lady in the building on previous occasions.   

700063
The richly insincere voice was unmistakable. 
`Oh hello, Colin," she said, as he strode towards her, the turned-back cuffs of his white <tag>shirt</> and suede jacket flapping.   

700064
They come from the alternative left originally, a sector which at its extremes is tinged with violence. 
But one can go on almost endlessly tinker-tailoring the sources of greenness: Nordic nature-loving fascist, Quaker, Zen Buddhist, Taoist, Social Creditist, Marxist, socialist, pacifist, quietist, 1930s Green <tag>Shirt</>.   

700065
In 1990 it was teenage mutant hero turtles. 
In 1994 it was middle-aged mutant hero football players; you could buy masks, sticker books, <tag>t-shirts</>, dolls and even see the film, it was a financial success even before the first match began. 

700066
B. Sherman did some very clumsy checks &dash. until those white with black / red / blue / green or yellow small checked shirts became part of the smooth uniform in 1971. 
Dark coloured B. Sherms after checks &dash. black, navy, maroon, green, red (early '71) then back to plain whites &and. pastels before the collar change. 
In the North these dark coloured <tag>shirts</> preceded checks. 

700067
It might have been true, but it sounded much too hopeful. 
Things did improve in the second half, especially after the introduction of Shaun Edwards, but exemplary support play had enabled Freeman to push the score out to 20-6 before Offiah began the rally. 
A major part in Alan Tait's try was followed by the winger's own length of the field try, though when the Kiwis came again, it was, predictably, Offiah's <tag>shirt</> left bearing Iro's hoof print. 

700068
Imran Sherwani, scorer of two Olympic-final goals for Great Britain in Seoul, will be unavailable for the World Cup in Lahore early next year because of business commitments.

700069
Their output of simple tunes and funny lyrics, stuffed with articulate observations of a peculiarly English low-life, made them the Kinks of the Eighties, a sort of British Steely Dan. 
Their reappearance at the Town &and. Country in London generated much excitement, pulling in hundreds of pleasant-looking couples, who had consciously dressed down for the nostalgia of it &dash. much as the band themselves had. 
No pyrotechnics or flashy costumes here, just a couple of very erratic spotlights and a line-up of ropy <tag>shirts</>. 

700070
Eyepatches became the rage at fancy-dress parties. 
And Hathaway, `a small company of dedicated craftsmen in the little town of Waterville, Maine," said their advertisements, `who have been at it, man and boy, for 114 years", sold out their stock of shirts within a week of the first eyepatch appearing in The New Yorker. 
In fact the anonymous man in the <tag>shirt</> was a male model but he was also, so it happened, a baron, the son of a Tsarist diplomat, by name George Wrangel. 

700071
They deserve it." 
Gascoigne, meanwhile, has been comforted by a deluge of good luck telegrams, which flooded into England's hotel after Wednesday's game against West Germany in Turin. 
As anyone watching his performance against Germany could see, Gascoigne wears his heart on his <tag>shirt</> and finds it hard to contain his emotion. 

700073
It was at the beginning of December and he was already regarded as the future President of Czechoslovakia, a position in which great importance is attached to dignified public appearances. 
Despite that (and without the knowledge of Index's editorial office) I asked him to let himself be photographed in the <tag>T-shirt</> for the future advertisement of the monthly, and thus to reimburse Index on Censorship for the financial loss suffered as a result of the wonderful recent developments in Czechoslovakia.   

700074
This time last year, they were in the middle of a sequence that brought only four wins in 14 League matches and a Littlewoods Cup exit at West Ham; come May they were denied the championship by a matter of seconds with the FA Cup already secured as consolation. 
As Dalglish put it on Saturday: `No one likes to lose, especially in a red <tag>shirt</>, but the most important thing is to keep a belief in how we play."   

700075
Isabelle Latouche had lasted four years and ten months. 
Having arrived in London with fifty pounds and a spare <tag>T-shirt</> to crash on another model's floor, she now never travelled with less than twenty-two pieces of Vuitton luggage.   

700078
His lunch was ready. 
Ada Gaily stared at the spilling-out white <tag>shirt</> and the maroon-bordered handkerchief.   

700079
The game is enthralling. 
But at #34.95 with a `free" <tag>T-shirt</> it ought to be.   

700080
You look entirely different." 
Marion Russell was wearing harem pants and an outsize <tag>T-shirt</> with Bob Geldof's face imprinted on it like the face of Christ on Veronica's napkin.   

700081
Beautiful is not an adjective you would use to describe Mick Jones. 
The former Clash guitarist looked even more cadaverous than we remembered, dressed like a Bisto kid in tatty hat, England football <tag>shirt</> and baggy, hand-me-down shorts.   

700082
Playing an investment banker, something which perhaps requires greater suspension of disbelief than the film's vision of the spirit world, Swayze gets to make all his crowd-pleasing moves in a novel setting. 
He gets his <tag>shirt</> off (decorating his NY loft).   

700083
The craze has been sparked by the new, trendy snob status of the Hermes scarf, first affected as an outre fashion rediscovery by male models and fashion editors two years ago. 
Quick to move into mainstream fashion, knock-off Hermes scarves, distinguished by their saddlery patterns, are now in the chainstores, often made into <tag>shirts</>, waistcoats, ties and other accessories.   

700084
A more realistic symbol for the people of St-Pargoire is the snail, and that for a very good reason. 
Local <tag>T-shirts</> sometimes sport this incongruous logo, whose adoption dates back to the great wine crash of the early part of the century. 

700085
The measure of hangovers went off any mere Richter scale. 
The bassist Leonard Gaskin rose one morning and spent 20 minutes in front of his hotel-room mirror trying to knot his tie. 
He then realised that he hadn't put on his <tag>shirt</>.   

700086
The nation looked on and failed to notice the difference. 
So there was singer with a funny <tag>shirt</> on.   

700087
Back in England, Grandstand played their new World Cup theme, Kylie Minogue's operatic version of I should be so lucky, a guaranteed success. 
Meanwhile back on the pitch the teams of Costa Rica and Germany United began their match with the new regulation FIFA thigh socks and long sleeved <tag>shirts</>.   

700088
She slept naked only when she had a lover. 
She had learned over the years that when her bedtime hands reached for the T-shirt then the affair was over, and sometimes this happened well before she had even half-conscious stirrings that the fun time was passed and that the long slow tide had turned. 
Tonight's <tag>T-shirt</> had once been a vivid sunny yellow, but long-ago encounters with blue socks and red blouses in the washing machine had faded it to a slightly sickly beige.   

700089
Richard Benson 
Once the exclusive domain of self-confessed `headers", Leeds United's terraces have been invaded by a new breed of hedonistic supporter. 
When United fans were kicking more than just sand castles down in Bournemouth, they wore <tag>T-shirts</> bearing the sinister motto `Nobody Likes Us And We Don't Care".  

700091
The portents started early, McEnroe netting a cinch of a volley as he came in on his very first serve. 
At once he was picking at his collar, fussing and fretting at the cut of his <tag>shirt</>.   

700092
Several glanced at us. 
There was a girl in a long <tag>shirt</> who stared at me tiredly and held out her right hand with a slight movement of her wrist, palm upwards, which in Lebanon is not an appeal for alms but a gesture of despair, a way of saying `What can we do?"  

700093
There are many photographs of Cocteau in his trademark suit staring with absolute assurance into the camera: Cocteau wearing a thick alpaca coat; Cocteau with a dark wool coat flung over his shoulders; Cocteau in dungarees; Cocteau in a duffel coat with Chanel. 
He was photographed by Man Ray in a sharp, dark suit with a striped shirt and white collar. 
He was painted by Modigliani and Picarbia in a white <tag>shirt</> and tiny bow tie.  

700094
Two men stood in the doorway, stopped dead in their tracks by seeing a naked man and a woman in a petticoat.

All the street hawkers seem to have learned their sales pitch in the same school.

700096
Among the many constraints on Africa's attempts at industrialization, the factors deriving from Africa's pre-colonial social structure must be deemed among the most important. 
The two World Bank men, one German and one British, strode across the tarmac in the steaming heat of Dar es salaam. 
Clearly men with a purpose, their well-ironed tropical suits and ties contrasted with the colourful informality of the other passengers and the rest of the airport crowd &dash. the men in body length kanzas or open neck <tag>shirts</>, and women in black buibuis stretching from their heads to below their knees or in multi-coloured kitenge dresses proclaiming variants on the theme of Uhuru na Mwalimu.

He does care about his own looks, but not in the conventional way.

`All what on his back?" Perhaps encouraged now by his first clear sight of the controversial tie and its <tag>shirt</> and jacket, Kenneth leaned gradually and confidentially forward, then, seeming to glimpse or recall something of importance overlooked, straightened up again and moved off, his right hand raised as if in farewell or benediction but actually, as Desmond saw when he turned away with the drinks, to reach out to replace a newly empty bottle of Southern Comfort that hung inverted as one of a row in front of his crowded shelves.
