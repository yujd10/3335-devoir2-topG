This is a circuituous route to First and Last (BBC 1), Michael Frayn's script about a dying man walking from Land's End to John O'Groats, but a scenic one.

He suggested that beneath the mouth  of the geyser is an irregularly-shaped column of hot water, which is  heated from below by conduction of heat directly from hot volcanic  rocks, or else indirectly by rising hot water, heated by contact with  hot rocks deeper down. 
Eventually, the water at the base of the column reaches boiling point,  although the water at the top is still well below it. 
Small bubbles of  steam form, and these <tag>float</> upwards, expanding as they go, and the  expansion of the bubbles pushes some of the water out of the top of the  column.

He reached out one of those abused skinny arms, the denim as soft as chamois leather, and scooped Maggie out of her cross and jealous world and into his magic one. 
His car was battered blue and silver, its fat black  rubber skirting apparently <tag>floating</> him above the tide of time and Maggie, with a delighted grin, entered with him into the music and the skill and the dance which suddenly became as graceful and fluid as hippopotami swimming under water.

The result is lack-lustre, even a bit tired, and the surprisingly spacious acoustic created in Abbey Road is hardly suited to music which is perpetually dodging rhythmic ruts; too many details sound washy.

It seems unlikely, however, that the White House will ever become a hospital.

The holes in Kapoor's blocks of stone are extraordinary, so pitch dark even in ordinary daylight that you wonder for a moment whether they might have been painted on: peering into them you find darkness made visible, a black, black void housed in solid matter. 
Angel has the opposite effect, presenting something that you know to be solid yet making it insubstantial, shrouding it in a blue so brilliant that it seems to shift and <tag>float</> in space.

But he did it without knowing why he wanted to and without knowing why he was glad his mother was out on the well-stones, unable to see him now. 
Curled up in bed that night with his knees almost touching his chin he heard the wireless song again, drifting up the stairs, bass notes exaggerated into a monotonous thump, thump.

The small lake in the hollow was gold and silver in the early sun, what was left of a dying mist curling above the surface. 
She took off her robe, pulled her nightdress above her head, waded out through the reeds and plunged into deep water.

They never appeared in danger of conceding points to a mundane Luton, only of complicating their journey to victory on a blustery afternoon when both sides, according to Graham, were guilty of `diabolical" defending. 
The most obvious example brought Luton their equaliser, Steve Williams <tag>floating</> a free-kick over a bunched defence to the unmarked Ian Dowie, whose header came back off John Lukic for Lars Elstrup to score.

That at any rate is the public message Andrew Longhurst, managing director, wants to get across.

It is extremely cold in this room, anyway, due to a misunderstanding with the bureaucrats who mismanage the electricity supply.

If you already use incineration on your premises then you must make sure that the smoke stack is fitted with a secure filter to prevent anything escaping from the incineration system. 
Because of the heat generated, these filters burn out fairly quickly and it has been known for whole sheets of burnt but completely legible paper to <tag>float</> about the surrounding area.

Unfortunately, the Bandon dries to a depth of about 18 inches at low tide and the channel narrows to a few feet of water flanked on either side by 100 yards or so of impassable mud. 
This could be awkward at night but friends advise me that a modest punt, launched upon the tide at Kinsale with myself in it, would <tag>float</> me to Innishannon within 90 minutes, with no need of my steering it.   

700180
Drexel, which used to commit $3 billion-5 billion of its own funds to market-making, has stopped even quoting prices on 3,000-4,000 junk bonds. 
Mr Greg Meredith, a bond specialist at Salomon Brothers, notes that only two recent junk-bond issues have been <tag>floated</> successfully: by Goldman Sachs for Kroger, and by Merrill Lynch for Sullivan Graphics.   

700181
Second, because a river's nature is one of changeless change, forever on the move,  the creatures which live in it have evolved strategies for surviving sudden floods  and disruptions and alterations of the river's course. 
Broken pieces of many  water plants have the ability to root again; others have seeds which <tag>float</> or seeds  which resist digestion in the stomachs of birds, and so can be transported  upstream.   

700182
In this state, a light object such as a cork or a plastic duck will bob  around on the surface of the powder (lecturers in chemical engineering  love to use a plastic duck), and if it's pushed under with a finger, it  will pop up immediately, just as it would in the bath at home. 
The dry powder is behaving like a liquid, and is said to be in a  fluidized condition, and in this condition the dynamic mixture of gas  and particles has a lower density than the original powder. 
It's important to realize that the particles don't actually `<tag>float</>" on  the gas stream, like ping-pong balls at a fair-ground shooting gallery;  they remain in intermittent contact with one another, and only part of  their weight is taken by the gas stream.   

700183
To the right of it  is a vertical river cliff, whose unstable eroding surface has provided a fresh seed-bed for the biennial teasel, but which is likely to continue to slip into the stream, despite the binding roots of the purple loosestrife on its top. 
Beside Ophelia's  head, the ever invasive forget-me-not and tall clumps of branched bur reed,  essential for the survival of many insects and fish, grow out into the stream,  trapping silt and clogging the watercourse. 
Finally, to ensure a flash-flood with  the advent of August thunderstorms, the mossy webs of crowfoot <tag>floating</> in the  foreground could raise the mean summer water-level of the stream by as much  as a metre. 

700185
Marcus O'Sullivan, twice world indoor 1500 metres champion, dogged his tracks. 
With his sort of finishing speed he might have broken the Kenyan, but he could find no finishing kick at this sort of pace and Ondieki <tag>floated</> away to a time, 7min 41.55sec, that only Said Aouita has beaten this summer. 

700186
Then, ever so gradually, it slows down. 
As the curtains rose, the band drifted into what would become the night's standard song introduction: two chords, lush with jazzy grace-notes. 
Fordham <tag>floated</> on between the drummer and the percussionist, looking relaxed: in fact, she may well have been asleep.

`We are each other's family. 
We all live together during a production," Flood explained as he led the way to a pillared house in one of the finest squares on the hilltop, where a tall, dark-haired woman in black harem pants opened the door. 
The upper windows blazed with light; quiet laughter and the growl of Patti Smith <tag>floated</> down the graceful half-spiral of the stairs.   

700191
Last March, John Baker, chief executive of National Power, the company that was to inherit the nuclear programme, warned in a leaked memorandum that privatisation would flop and the plan to build four PWRs would founder unless those costs were borne by the taxpayer. 
In April, its financial advisers, the merchant bank Lazards, was warning that `the fundamental and unprecedented" problems of <tag>floating</> National Power might force the Government into a cut-price sale. 

700193
Kreuzburg, Berlin's answer to downtown New York, is an area of seedy businesses, new cafes, clothes shops and galleries and, to the visitor, an extraordinary pocket of youth style suspended in time. 
Since the war, young people have been encouraged to come to West Berlin by authorities who were worried the place would become a de-populated, aged island <tag>floating</> in the GDR.   

700194
But I changed my clothes several times, unable to make up my mind as to the look I wanted. 
Should I wear a skirt and sweater in one of the pale beiges or apricots that suit my coloring so well? 
An image of Daniel Korper's hands <tag>floated</> before me, and I changed into my tightest pair of jeans, stuck them into a pair of high-heeled black suede boots, and wrapped a filmy violet silk blouse against my chest.   

700196
Here are people who are busy, who work hard, who go to lots of meetings, who chair committees, who make decisions about corporate strategy, who get invited to Covent Garden. 
Yet actually the companies they head would be worth more if they did not exist: if none of the functions they perform were done at all, and all the businesses they manage were simply <tag>floated</> off on the market as individual companies.   

700198
The company operates a performance-based fee structure; investors receive a full financial review, for which they pay a fee of 1 per cent of their portfolio, and thereafter an annual 10 per cent of the annual profits generated by their investment. 
WITH mortgage rates <tag>floating</> around the stratosphere once again, borrowers are naturally looking for ways to keep down their monthly payments.

I was once in the reeds, for a project on Moses, and heard him talking to himself. 
He was alone, a dark shape against the setting sun, wearing a cloak and a hat like Gladys Cooper. 
The small sail of the boat was furled as he <tag>floated</> on the trickle of sunlight across the water, and I was invisible, being up to my private parts in the bog, the basket having sunk.   

700201
Instead the Red Lancers, many of whom were Belgians, trotted eastwards in search of a ford. 
On the river's northern bank a troop of black-uniformed Prussian Hussars shadowed the Red Lancers, and it was those Hussars who, rounding a bend in the Sambre Valley, discovered a party of French engineers <tag>floating</> a pontoon bridge off the southern bank.   

700202
THE TEN water authorities which will be sold off later this month are planning to award their executive directors pay rises immediately after privatisation to bring their salaries into line with those paid in the private sector. 
Once the companies have been <tag>floated</> there will be an internal review of salary levels for executive directors which in some cases will be supplemented by the introduction of bonuses and performance related pay.

The former Chancellor &dash. who received repeated rumbles of support from both sides of the Chamber &dash. said the article had been `of significance only inasmuch as it represented the tip of a singularly ill-concealed iceberg with all the destructive potential that icebergs possess". 
He said exchange rate policy was an essential element in the financial discipline required to get inflation down, and recognised that sterling could either be allowed to <tag>float</> or be held relatively stable.   

700205
Revenues this year are expected to double, although dependence on the UK will gradually decrease, according to Millicom's chairman, Shelby Bryan. 
As the largest shareholder in Racal Electronics, Millicom last year argued fiercely against plans to <tag>float</> off Racal's cellular radio company Vodafone.   

700206
No one explains it to me, and I'm bewildered; I feel like a doll, lying on the hospital bed, paper thin &dash. the little dolls I used to make when I was younger. 
I feel that the doctors might accidentally tear me up, or that I might flap off the bed in a gust of wind and <tag>float</> away.   

700208
The following experiments cannot be entirely satisfactory on the page of a book for they are influenced by other illustrations, the recilinearity of the page, the test and the general environment. 
However, using graphics as a research medium, suppose that a dot is dimensionless and <tag>floating</> in a void.

The shares fell 20p to 832p. 
Euro Disney, <tag>floated</> at 707p last month, ran into a bout of profit taking, falling 15p to 940p.

His lucid exposition of the economic and political case for early membership of the ERM contrasted favourably with Mr Major's `the time is not yet right but it might come a bit sooner than you think" approach. 
That exchange rates are best managed and not left to <tag>float</> challenged Mrs Thatcher's instinct directly.   

700212
The monotype clients never participate in this reflexive process in quite the same way: their embodiment is a function of, and a response to, their gaze. 
We have seen that this response tends to erase the corporeality of the observing male presence as it retreats outside the frame and <tag>floats</> in space.   

700214
IT WAS unfair of Auden to suggest, in his `Letter to Lord Byron", that a poet's `sense of other people's very hazy". 
But the vaporous presences that <tag>float</> through this slender and anaemic first novel by a notable poet would appear to support the claim.

Cyril holds forth on our previous evening, making it sound funny, but not coming out of it in such a good light as he thinks. 
`We had been told about their wonderful new pair of cooks.

Such an idea is not new.

Because of the environmental benefits of winter flooding for  birds, conservationists have long been interested in the practical restoration of  water-meadows which, following their introduction in the sixteenth century,  were the last word in sophisticated farming technology alongside many southern  English rivers. 
Water was `<tag>floated</>" along brim-full channels, as described by  Thomas Hardy, `on a plan so rectangular that on a fine day, they look like silver  gridirons".   

700227
Yes, it's very hard because you get to that stage where you know you can only really push forward for so long, then when it &ellip. you know, the whistle looms near, you try and you know, you're just going to go for the result really, and keep it you know, a clean sheet and just get a point out of the game. 
Did you see much of the goal, or as it was a free kick <tag>floated</> in and Martin Foyle headed it back across the face of goal and {vocal sound="um"} your partner in crime really at the back put it in.

She was certainly far from her normal state of mind. 
At times she was very subjective, at others quite detached as if <tag>floating</> outside her body.

The pumice that we know from painful  experience in the bathroom consists of material containing over 65 per  cent of silica, and there is a general tendency to associate pumice only  with acid rocks such as rhyolites. 
Strictly speaking, though, pumice is only a kind of highly vesicular glassy rock with a low density, so low that many types will <tag>float</> on  water, and it may be anywhere between basalt and rhyolite in  composition.

These visitors are projected to spend more than Ffr 9bn a year by 1996. 
At 707p a share, which is higher than the top end of the range indicated in the pathfinder prospectus, Eurodisney offers an average return of 13.3 per cent, compared to more than 17 per cent for Eurotunnel when it was <tag>floated</>.

A world's first, for moi. 
It felt reassuring to think that if the plane packed up, we would splash down and <tag>float</> safely, rather than sink.

The Prime Minister will arrive in Paris tomorrow afternoon, but has already made the most contentious foreign contribution. 
Le Monde's cartoon yesterday showed other world leaders arriving in Paris on parachutes made from revolutionary bonnets while Mrs Thatcher <tag>floated</> down on a Union Jack.

And governments in power tend to make use of laws, even if they opposed those laws while they passed through Parliament." 
The victims of Lepanges: four-year-old Gregory Villemin, drowned in the river; Bernard Larouche, with his wife Marie-Ange and their son Sebastian, shot dead by Gregory's father after being released from arrest; and Christine Villemin, accused of murdering her own son IT IS NOW more than five years since the body of Gregory Villemin was dragged from the river Vologne at Docelles in eastern France. 
Hands and ankles bound, woollen bonnet pulled down over his face, a thin cord around his neck, the four-year-old <tag>floated</> quietly, face down in his blue anorak like some discarded package thrown on to the water. 

700243
It would reduce the part which high interest rates play in maintaining the value of the pound. 
If Mrs Thatcher still hankers after a floating exchange rate, she should try to persuade her colleagues of that policy. 
Assuming that she cannot persuade them, and since in any case she would detest a pound which <tag>floated</> quickly down, she must strengthen the credibility of the exchange-rate element in the Government's anti-inflation strategy by supporting our early entry into the ERM.

Electra does not revalue unlisted shares in the first year after it acquires its interest.

But when the heroine crosses from East to West, she discovers that psychological barriers are no less formidable than physical ones. 
Even more evocative are the writings of Gunter Kunert, who celebrates the city's decaying buildings in prose poems transforming bricks and mortar into images of collective memory. 
For Kunert the political divide is compounded by the breakdown of continuity with the past, which deprives modern Berlin of its inner reality, leaving it <tag>floating</> like a dream city on the frontiers of time. 

700248
It was not, however, accompanied by much new information. 
Mr Maxwell confirmed plans to <tag>float</> Berlitz later this month through an international share offering and to sell Maxwell Graphics, the North American printing business.

When a volcano erupts actually beneath the sea, a series of stages in  the activity can usually be identified. 
At first, there will be little  to see other than an area of dirty, discoloured water, possibly hot or  `boiling", and probably with a good many dead fish <tag>floating</> around in  it.

United States officials credit the CIA for coming up with the initial clues in the Bloch affair. 
In French intelligence circles, however, there are rumours of a Soviet spy ring linked to Gikman operating out of the Soviet mission to Unesco on the Rue Miollis, and of a Soviet embassy staff member found dead, <tag>floating</> down the Seine, last spring.

PRIVATISATION of the water industry is likely to cost the taxpayer at least #1.3bn, it emerged yesterday after the Government published a 604-page pathfinder prospectus showing net proceeds from the share issues would be much lower than expected. 
City analysts estimated that the Government would realise a maximum of #5.3bn when the 10 water authorities of England and Wales are <tag>floated</> on the stock market early next month.

Any delay in agreeing the contracts threatens to place in jeopardy the scheduled flotation of the 12 area boards &dash. or distribution companies (distcos) as they are now known &dash. early next year.

The #450,000 purchase from Ipswich continued throughout to suggest that he may prove his namesake's most inspired signing.

I don't suppose it would matter much if I fell in anyhow,  cos I can nearly swim.

IT'S 
BEEN a long time coming, but one of the year's best singles, World of Twist's debut `The Storm", is about to seep its atmospheric vibe into the mainstream. 
A thunderous, psychedelicious affair, `The Storm" <tag>floats</> along on the ghostly groove, touching on early '80's electro pop, a late-'80s dance feel and even the danker ends of the late-'60s trip, while the B-side offers a spruced-up version of The Rolling Stones' `She's A Rainbow". 

700267
There will be at least one change to the environment when the water industry is privatised. 
Gordon Jones, chairman of Yorkshire Water and of the Water Authorities Association, has pledged to shave off his beard as soon as the 10 water companies are floated. 
The National &and. Provincial Building Society's decision this week to shelve indefinitely its decision on whether to renounce its mutual status and <tag>float</> on the stock market will please Andrew Longhurst, managing director of the rival Cheltenham &and. Gloucester society.

However, Brian Rout, a director of Throgmorton, said the first he heard of the Domeaction offer was when it came up on the screens in the City yesterday morning. 
The management offer is believed to involve ICH changing its domicile and <tag>floating</> a small percentage of its shares on Wall Street, where the group's Fulton Prebon operations have a strong reputation.

There was a silence.

That opening scene in the smoky restaurant, everyone drinking, talking with and over and through each other: suddenly there were other people in Woody Allen films. 
They certainly made up for lost time: 11 years on, he is now the most social director in America, one of the few who understand the use of an ensemble on film, the strains of concord and discord which <tag>float</> around a bunch of people.

Sharper than any other sense is that of smell; but that, I suspect, is very common indeed. 
It is harder to write about the way this kind of exploring may affect not simply your understanding of your own sensuous responses but also your habits of thought. 
After you have looked for a long time at some set of opinions you have never looked closely at before, which have done service for a very long period, after all sorts of qualifications to them have <tag>floated</> up from those peculiar depths you are now plumbing, you realise with what disconnected and half-considered fragments of thought many of your conversations on these matters have been conducted.

The shaking table is a 50-tonne concrete plate set horizontally in a hole in a concrete floor with several centimetres of play at the edges. 
In a cellar-like room below, however, a spider's web of tubing and hydraulic actuator arms is connected to the table.

White cattle graze on pastures filled with downy rose-pink mallows of the marsh.

And, according to Mr Abbell, it is common for US attorneys to use their experience in government once they move to private practice. 
Yet at the same time as he was representing members of the Cali cartel, Mr Abbell was on Capitol Hill lobbying for changes in the international treaty on extradition which would favour the defendants in such cases. 
Last month, at the height of terrorist violence in Colombia, he also <tag>floated</> a `compromise" plan between the US and the cartel leaders, under which the drug lords would stand trial in the US, but return to Colombia to serve their sentences.

Warburgs may well turn out to be the big losers from any sale of PowerGen to an individual buyer. 
There they were, innocently acting for the company, assuming that the utility would be <tag>floated</> just like any other privatisation issue, and all of a sudden there they are in a bid battle, except that the seller has its own merchant banks and will not recognise the expensive preliminary slog undertaken by Warburgs.

For the remaining 47% he turned to the Norwegian shipping magnate Fred Olsen who coughed up a #12 million stake in the yards. 
But it is in the employees that Parker places his faith: `This is a people-intensive business," he proclaims and points out that 77% of the workforce bought shares when the firm was <tag>floated</> in September 1989 and that 75% still hold them.

Bad debts declined but the Leeds nevertheless more than doubled its provisions to #1.6m. 
On the question of conversion to PLC, Mr Blackburn said the society was now in a stronger position to convert, should it want to, but there was no reason to: `We have sufficient capital and sufficient sources of capital." 
The National &and. Provincial building society has indefinitely shelved any immediate plans to convert to a company and <tag>float</> on the stock market.

Tilda got up and went over to the mansard window in her tiny, sloping-walled room. 
She felt cold all over, she said: was it because the owl's hooting had come after the sound of the chopper had died away, thus showing the criminal uncaught and triumphant? 
Or was it, as the gullible Tilda was only too prone to believe, because the `bad karma" of that evil woman Mrs Hyde in the gardens had <tag>floated</> up to her in her perch above the trees and told her of the approaching crime?

It does not have the well-poised suppleness of a Peugeot 205 GTi, but then, only potholes and sharp ridges seriously ruffle its composure. 
On occasion, over high-frequency undulations, the GT will follow the road's contours a little too religiously, setting up a fast, bobbing motion, but this is preferable to the car <tag>floating</> or leaping from crest to crest.
