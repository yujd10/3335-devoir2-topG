A POSTCARD from the architectural historian, Priscilla Metcalf, thrust in my copy of The Halls of the Fishmongers' Company (1977), asks me to show it to a student whose undergraduate thesis she had used (and acknowledged); expresses concern that publishers should send out review copies other than through Review Editors; reproves me tactfully for a belated review of one of Pevsner's books; and refers lightly to the imminent problem of losing her accommodation &dash. `if you know of any wishful landlord not scared of the Rent Act".

On Totally Religious, it's his dedication that's impressive, the death-or-glory intensity of feeling behind the music. 
When he sings `I don't want my name on the wall of shame" (on `Wall Of Shame"), he's singing of upholding honour in the face of base instincts, of endurance as the heroic act of the age, rather than any sword and sorcery nonsense. 
He knows it's relatively easy to rock out convincingly when you're young, but when you're that bit older, balder, and possessed of fewer illusions, it takes real commitment to keep on doing it when your returns have been as <tag>modest</> as the Messiahs'.

Far from the reductions of 15-20 per cent in human-caused methane emissions and 70-80 per cent of the excess nitrous oxide which the scientists of IPCC Working Group 1 say are needed if the goal is to stabilize greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the built-in pressures of an expanding population and agricultural enterprise will cause rapid rises. 
If, in a global movement toward controlling greenhouse-gas emissions, the agricultural sector and the underlying driving force of population growth are forgotten or neglected, heroic efforts to convert the energy sector might be negated as the more potent methane and nitrous oxide emissions build up in place of C02. 
In that circumstance, agriculture's fairly <tag>modest</> 14-per-cent share of the greenhouse buildup could quickly double, assuming no significant change in sinks.

I like to think there's a qualitative difference between Bach and Madonna. 
Bill, could I come back to a quotation by another former Tory Prime Minister in the nineteen sixties, {vocal sound="um"} they were ragging old Douglas Hume unmercifully, the Labour Party did, when he was made Prime Minister, and, you know, {vocal sound="um"} all's fair in politics, and Harold Wilson, I think, made the comment that the democracy of this country had ground to a halt with the appointment of the fourteenth earl, and Douglas Hume, in his sort of very self-deprecating way and his very <tag>modest</> way, says `well, you know, I suppose if one were to ask, he's probably the fourteenth Mr Wilson".

The natural link between the two otter populations of the Severn and the Vyrnwy had been totally denuded of trees, as had an extensive intervening reach between the well-treed Welsh reaches and the wooded banks of the Severn much further downstream. 
A few otters might hurry through this inhospitable gulf, but they would hardly pause to breed and so build up a population there. 
In 1984 the local water authority began a long-term programme of planting this empty stretch of waterway at <tag>modest</> annual expense, following a detailed survey of otter populations by naturalists.   

700218
Monetary policy was eased too quickly after the October 1987 share price crash, for it was not appreciated the crash would have little impact in the real economy; and the extra six months of tax relief on mortgages taken out by couples during the summer of 1988 encouraged a borrowing surge and so gave a final twist to the house price spiral; the borrowed funds, in part, `leaked" into extra consumer spending. 
That the consumer boom is clearly a thing of the past, the fascinating question will be how quickly the current account will correct itself. 
There is even a <tag>modest</> possibility the correction will be evident by the time of the Budget.

This concept, brilliantly and amusingly elucidated in book of that name published the previous year by Professor C. Northcote Parkinson, stated: `Work expands to fill the time available for its completion."

Many estate agents were whistling to keep up their confidence this week, claiming that people were already used to the idea of higher mortgage rates and that the latest increase would make little difference. 
But Gary Marsh, head of research with the Halifax, the UK's biggest building society, says it is inevitable that the <tag>modest</> improvement seen in the market over the last couple of months &dash. especially in the South, where sellers have started to adjust to more realistic levels &dash. will be damaged and the date of its recovery put back.

He will be sworn in as prime minister today. 
For the enigmatic 58-year-old architect of Mr Gandhi's election collapse, yesterday's vote proved a victorious conclusion not just to two years of lonely and frequently controversial struggle against Congress (I) thuggery and fraud, but also to an awkward and embarrassing week of internal party upheavals that had threatened to deny him the supreme political prize. 
That Mr Singh was able to overcome both Mr Gandhi's well-entrenched battalions and the jealous rivals working to undermine his cause, suggests that behind his <tag>modest</> and self-effacing facade, India's new prime minister possesses a steel will.

Across the city in <tag>modest</> three-bedroomed suburbia, Bergara explained how County had been buffeted by Lincoln's long-ball attempts to probe weakness behind Paul Jones, the 36-year-old former Bolton Wanderers central defender drafted into a makeshift side.

Mr King, who in Northern Ireland showed little understanding of nationalism, was uncomfortable with the wider implications of the agreement and sought to reduce it to elements he could deal with.

The size of permissible awards for punitive damages has become even more startling. 
Awards used to be kept in bounds, as they still are in Commonwealth jurisdictions,{fo id=140} by the requirement that they ought to be proportionate to compensatory damages awarded for the actual injury suffered{fo id=141} and by the fact that, in the traditional area of physical aggression, the defendant's typically <tag>modest</> resources inevitably set a low limit on what he could be expected to pay.

`As demand in the economy slows down," Mr Lawson said, `this will in due course show up in a marked decline in the recent rapid growth in imports."

Even an organization that aspires to leadership must select carefully the areas in which it believes such leadership will pay off; even an organization that sets a low aspiration level should not be indifferent to technologies that affect the heart of its business.

IT IS difficult, but not impossible, to spot the links between the Simple Minds of 1989 and the Simple Minds of the early '80s. While the former favour a somewhat bombastic rock approach, the latter opted for a more atmospheric presentation. 
While his political sensibility has matured beyond recognition, Jim Kerr, mainstay and spokesman of the band, has not altered his musical ambitions; older tracks like the evocative synthesizer-based Someone Somewhere In Summertime are a reminder that even when his audience was rather more <tag>modest</>, he still coloured his compositions in bold, anthemic strokes.

Although few in the world of estate agency have been immune to losses, some of the big financial groups timed their move better than others and have been less severely affected. 
Lloyds Bank, whose Black Horse network is amongst the largest, was able to buy top quality estate agencies for what now look like <tag>modest</> prices.   

700262
The scientists were being cautious and so were the civil servants; this meant that British politicians could happily continue to struggle over familiar issues until 1988 when a devastating drought enabled scientists in the USA to get the ear of the Senate and pour into it a story sufficiently sensational to alarm the rest of the Western world. 
The scientists who man the climatological observation posts are less cautious than they used to be now that the general theory of climate change has become common property; government servants are more confident and outspoken; and, while scepticism remains, no cabinet minister is likely to denounce the theory and the accompanying evidence as hysterical. 
In 1978-9 the British government spent a <tag>modest</> #250,000 on research, including the development of climate models.

Thames Tunnel Mills &dash. is described in this chapter, while the final chapter of the book contains an analysis of a similar building that has been converted to house a range of new uses, including sixty apartments.
