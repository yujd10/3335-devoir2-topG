First, they tend to be birds that prefer to stay more or less in one place, once settled &dash. as opposed to migrants, which flit in more often, but tend not to settle. 
Second, they do best if there are repeated invasions; partly for the obvious reason that it takes at least two birds to breed, and partly because the failure rate of invasion is liable to be high and repeats are needed.

Both players end the game with at least the `benchmark", all C, score and with Suspicious Tit for Tat scoring a bonus for its initial defection. 
Boyd and Lorberbaum showed that a population of Tit for Tat could be invaded, evolutionarily speaking, by a mixture of Tit for Two Tats and Suspicious Tit for Tat, the two prospering in each other's company.

From this point on, Nana becomes the sacrificial victim of the circulus. 
She attracts desire to herself, absorbs its noxious effects, like the `bonne fille" she is, and, in true scapegoat fashion, is sacrificed to restore the health and balance of the social order, thereby allowing the novel to end.

But they only take to the extreme point of nauseous disgust the obsessive fear of woman's sexual nature, epitomized by the prostitute, that pervades the male imagination, both novelistic and scientific, throughout the 19th century and reaches a kind of hysterical paroxysm in its last two decades.

`Not since the Beatles" first <tag>invaded</> America has a British artist evoked such hysteria," wrote one magazine; and it is perfectly true that, while in Britain Branagh-bashing has become a national sport, in America he is widely admired for his youthful get-up-and-go energy.

Surely `prudish" is simply a natural desire for privacy and separation which is an essential part of growing up; and surely having your parents writing about your breast development in a baby book is not very likely to make you feel unselfconscious about it!

The soul-searching that went on in the security community, in the think tanks and universities throughout the United States in 1990 gives some hint of that `sense of loss". 
The Gulf war can be viewed as an attempt to reverse the irreversible. 
Just at the moment when the establishment figures on both sides of the Atlantic were talking about substantial cuts in military spending, when the role of the hawkish political leaders was being eclipsed, when the United States seemed to be floating away from its international role, and new self-confident Europe seemed to be on the verge of creation, Iraq <tag>invaded</> Kuwait.

No country in the Middle East desires Syria's humiliation in Lebanon more than does Iraq. 
It was the Iraqis who planned the assassination of the Israeli ambassador in London in 1982 and it was his attempted murder that allowed the Israelis the opportunity to <tag>invade</> Lebanon and humble the Syrian army.

Directorial concept and performance fused perfectly in a Soviet import, staged outside the festival's ambit at the Victory Gardens Theatre: Dear Elena Sergaevna by Lyudmilla Razumovskaya. 
Originally banned in 1980, it is best described as a Russian Clockwork Orange.

The coachman cracked his whip, the Emperor's carriage lurched forward, and the battle for Europe had begun.

The interview was picked up by local freelance reporters and was passed on to national newspapers, many of which carried stories the following morning. 
THE CHANCES of the Kremlin wanting to <tag>invade</> the West are `very, very remote", but Nato still needs its strategy of nuclear deterrence as a hedge against an attack from the East, according to Admiral Sir Julian Oswald, the First Sea Lord &dash. the professional head of the Royal Navy.

The Liberals insisted on remaining highminded. 
Many of them had come to support the war only when the Germans <tag>invaded</> Belgium; even the less Radical among them were relieved to escape from a `realist" position.

Is going to the Nutcracker a religious experience since it is part of the annual festival commemorating Christ's birth (or making the winter solstice, if you prefer)? 
For the Athenians the great Dionysia was an occasion to stop work, drink a lot of wine, eat some meat, and witness or participate in the various ceremonials, processions and priestly doings which are part of such holidays the world over. 
It was also the occasion for tragedy and comedy; but I do not see any way in which the Dionysiac occasion <tag>invades</> or affects the entertainment.

Coercion diminishes a person's options. 
It is sometimes supposed that that provides a full explanation of why it <tag>invades</> autonomy.

WITH all the youngsters now <tag>invading</> the tennis world, it was somewhat ironic, perhaps even worrying, that Chris Evert turned out to be the heroine of the 27th Federation Cup, in Tokyo, which ended yesterday with a predictable victory for the United States.

In fact it is not all that obvious, and I did take the precaution of simulating it on a computer to check that intuition was right. 
Grudger does indeed turn out to be an evolutionarily stable strategy against sucker and cheat, in the sense that, in a population consisting largely of grudgers, neither cheat nor sucker will invade. 
Cheat is also an ESS, however, because a population consisting largely of cheats will not be <tag>invaded</> by either grudger or sucker.   

700110
Recriminations poured on Mr Botha from all quarters, including Britain and the United States, after what appears now to have been an unsubstantiated allegation which succeeded both in disrupting the uneasy pre-electoral equilibrium in Namibia and providing South Africa's detractors, especially Swapo, with welcome propaganda ammunition. 
On Wednesday, Mr Botha, accompanied imposingly by the Defence Minister, Magnus Malan, and the head of the army, General Jannie Geldenhuys, had announced that, according to interceptions of radio messages between United Nations troops on the Namibian border, more than 600 Swapo fighters had <tag>invaded</> Namibia.

Far more discretion is allowed to the trial judge, who is in a better position to form an opinion on the fairness of the verdict in the light of the general conduct and atmosphere of the trial. 
For the sake of efficiency, and notwithstanding constitutional challenges for <tag>invading</> the province of the jury,{fo id=141} a wide spread practice has developed of offering to the litigants a judicial award as an alternative to a new jury trial.

Geometry, then, is concerned with the production of figures by various motions. 
After it, says Hobbes, our thoughts should turn to what is, in effect, mechanics: `the consideration of what effects one body moved worketh upon another." 
We should consider what happens when one moving body comes into contact with another: `what way, and with what swiftness, the <tag>invaded</> body shall move; and, again, what motion this second body will generate in a third."   

700116
The Duke was offering bland reassurance about the scanty news of the day's skirmishes. 
Brussels was full of rumours about a French attack, rumours that the Duke was scarcely able to correct or deny. 
He knew there had been fighting about Charleroi, and he had heard of some skirmishes being fought in the villages south of the Prince of Orange's headquarters, but whether the French had <tag>invaded</> in force, or whether there was an attack coming in the direction of Mons, the Duke still did not know.

While American troops secured almost complete control of the capital, meeting some resistance from armed supporters of the deposed military leader, General Manuel Noriega, US military officials turned a blind eye to the anarchy prevailing in the streets. 
Late in the day heavy fighting continued in the San Miguelito suburb of the capital, a Noriega stronghold, where paramilitary Dignity Battalions were regrouping for a last stand against the American troops who <tag>invaded</> on Tuesday.

Ashkenazy took no fee; and it was poignant that Decca, who have had him on exclusive contract for years, were not doing the recordings. 
Desperate for cash, the promoters auctioned the rights and EMI offered far more than anyone else &dash. which is perhaps why the EMI team felt it was their prerogative to turn the first Conservatoire concert into a studio session, <tag>invading</> the platform and organising retakes while the audience looked on, confused and irritated.

The term `Palestine" was coined over 1,000 years later by the Romans who renamed the country after the ancient Philistines in an attempt to de-Judaise the Holy Land and expunge all Jewish references. 
The Philistines have nothing to do with the Arabs, a Semitic people, who <tag>invaded</> the Holy Land from Arabia in the seventh century.

On the television screen in my home I watched the muscles on George Bush's face contract, and listened to his voice, dry and unfeeling, as he informed the peoples of the world that the war on Iraq had begun: to liberate Kuwaiti people, punish aggression, and ensure that a new world order, based on peace and security, would be established for all peoples no matter how small. 
He condemned the ruler of Iraq, Saddam Hussein for <tag>invading</> Kuwait, an act which he qualified as violating the principles of international law and of the United Nations.

The criminal law? 
(The Padlock Act was struck down because it <tag>invaded</> that exclusive federal jurisdiction; but Section 16 of the Accord might wipe that out.)

The Soviet Union, after all, has recently acted with sophisticated restraint in circumstances that must have been more irritating to Soviet leaders than anything General Noriega has done. 
A Republican Administration in Washington might recall the fury of its predecessor 33 years ago when Britain, France and Israel, by <tag>invading</> Egypt to punish a dictator and protect a canal, robbed the West of political cohesion and moral standing in the face of the Soviet invasion of Hungary.

A representative of the new Panamanian government of President Guillermo Endara was barred from taking part.

After reading your article on the refusal of planning permission for Oxford's only skateboard ramp, I would like to inquire what would Labour like to see in the East Oxford/St Clement's areas (not restaurants, or people showing initiative in setting up popular, `community"-type shops). 
The presence of the ramp behind the shop they say <tag>invades</> the privacy of people in Princes and Union Streets &dash. the ramp is 4ft high!

Freya's story is unusual in some ways, in that unlike Alison Freya started off, as she says, quite happy with her body; it was the reaction of other people that made her uncertain. 
I think this is about our physical boundaries again, as it was in Alison's story, showing how fragile the self-image of girls can be, how easily <tag>invaded</> by others &dash. and also, how difficult it is to like your body if it is curvaceous, if you are naturally fleshy, fat, large-breasted or pear-shaped, as many of us are.

International law and the Geneva conventions apply only to the endless cases of aggression around the world, with the US, Britain and Israel being some of the main provocateurs in the aggressors' camp.

South Africa said yesterday that it had successfully fired a booster rocket, but gave no details about the missile's performance or purpose, the state weapons company, Armscor, said.

In our sci-fi age, Doctor Who and others would no doubt describe such a rift in their `space-time continuum" as a `time warp" through which Daleks and other horrors would inevitably burst. 
Back in prehistoric times, the ghoolies and ghosties which were believed to invade our lives on New Year's Day, known as Samain, had either to be bribed or fought off. 
Bribing the gods to be merciful to us poor miserable humans was a full-time prehistoric activity, and bribes almost certainly included members of our own species, sacrificed to the <tag>invading</> gods and spirits. 

700155
Naturally, it is only possible for the computer to detect exceptions for those variables for which actual performance data enter the system. 
If, for example, the system does not collect detailed data pertaining to individual sales items at a supermarket checkout counter, then it has no basis for comparing actual performance against whatever standard might exist. 
As interactive terminals <tag>invade</> all operational aspects of the factory, office, and service facility, the computer can conceivably apply exception criteria to almost everything.

Or that moment that all warriors know, the hush that seems to silence the wind itself, as the day of battle dawns. 
The prod is not to be confused with the caress which gently brushes a surface. 
Whereas the former <tag>invades</> territory, the latter respects boundaries.   

700158
Coercion can be used to prevent extreme cases where severely offending or hurting another's feelings interferes with or diminishes that person's ability to lead a normal autonomous life in the community. 
But offence as such should be restrained and controlled by other means, ones which do not <tag>invade</> freedom.

Mussolini had been under few illusions about Italy's strength in June 1940. 
But he supposed that he was taking on two dead ducks and, once in the war, his vanity swelled.

When it meets a Tit for Two Tats player, on the other hand, Tit for Two Tats's greater forgivingness nips this recrimination in the bud. 
Both players end the game with at least the `benchmark", all C, score and with Suspicious Tit for Tat scoring a bonus for its initial defection. 
Boyd and Lorberbaum showed that a population of Tit for Tat could be <tag>invaded</>, evolutionarily speaking, by a mixture of Tit for Two Tats and Suspicious Tit for Tat, the two prospering in each other's company.

One is a part author of one's world only if one is not merely serving the will of another. 
Forcing persons, and therefore coercing them, to act <tag>invades</> their autonomy because, first, the person who forces others directly intends them to conform to his will.   

700174
This was because no rugby event was included in the top 10 which gave the BBC a privileged position. 
Now this position has, with the Government's blessing, been <tag>invaded</>, not only by the old independent companies but also by the new ones such as Sky and British Satellite Broadcasting.   

700175
How can it possibly be construed as unreasonable that the US discuss and join in an internationally negotiated end to the occupation of Palestine and Lebanon as well as Kuwait? 
And how can it be construed as reasonable that the US and their Western allies continue to control and plunder the oil resources in the Arab region via puppet regimes such as those they have directly installed in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, while the Arab World, like the rest of the `Third World", finds itself experiencing an ever increasing and intolerable poverty at the hands of Western capitalism and imperialism. 
Whether Saddam Hussein had <tag>invaded</> or not, Kuwait's days in its present form were numbered anyway, as are the days of all puppet regimes in the Arab World.

But with the Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, now honoured with a Nobel Peace Prize not merely for his religious work but for `his struggle for the liberation of Tibet", China's efforts to keep him and his cause in quarantine will be all the more difficult. 
The award also challenges China's long-held view that Tibetans sheltering abroad are no more than terrorists bent on disrupting the `unity of the motherland". 
For Peking, Tibet has been an inseparable part of China since the 13th century, although direct control was not established until 1950, when the People's Liberation Army <tag>invaded</> the region after the revolution.  

700183
Yet, harsh natural conditions can reduce the degree of autonomy of a person to a bare minimum just as effectively as systematic coercive intervention. 
Moreover, non-coercive interferences with a person's life and fortunes may also reduce his autonomy in the same way as coercive interventions do. 
The only differences are that all coercive interventions <tag>invade</> autonomy and they do so intentionally, whereas only some non-coercive interventions do so and usually as a by-product of their intended results.   

700185
On 19 August the British withdrew from British Somaliland &dash. their only African territory to fall under enemy occupation, though only for seven months.

Yet twenty-five miles to the south the French were already pushing the Prussian forces eastwards, away from the British. 
No one in Brussels knew that the French had <tag>invaded</>; instead they prepared for a duchess's ball while a fat Prussian major paid for his roast chicken, finished his wine, then ambled slowly northwards. 

700190
Not surprisingly, most political commentators read Bush's astonishingly foolhardy pledge as an allusion to what most of the US military and many civilians consider the unsatisfactory end to the Vietnam war. 
The reference, however, might serve equally well for Panama. 
One year after the US <tag>invaded</> Panama with 30,000 troops on December 20, 1989, and removed General Manuel Noriega from power (see SR Feb 1990), significant issues surrounding that invasion seem destined for the dustbin of `murky endings".
