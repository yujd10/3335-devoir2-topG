Ballyhane's trainer, Josh Gifford, whose Green Willow (1.45) is expected to continue a glittering career over fences at Market Rasen, is confident that his eight-year-old can make the breakthrough.

In England where the top prize of the day of #43,797 for the Northumberland Plate at Newcastle seems paltry compared with what our overseas runners were collecting, Guy Harwood gained another success in a long distance handicap with Orpheus, the only 3-year-old in the race. 
Orpheus had appeared so well handicapped that when the ante-post betting opened he was made the 9-4 favourite. 
On the course he drifted out to 4-1, which would have come as a pleasant surprise to stay-at-home backers but was not so popular with <tag>betting</> office proprietors.

The market is looking for taxable profits of about #60m in 1990, with earnings expected to be rise by around 15 per cent.

For mile races just 12 can go to post. 
While harrassed <tag>betting-shop</> staff are far from happy by the extra work an 11am start brings, racegoers will at least get excellent value for money if the large number of entries continues after this opening meeting.

Labour is likely to plump for a more straightforward version of one-member-one-vote, as Mr Kinnock wanted all along. 
If I were a <tag>betting</> man, I would wager that by the time the National Executive has investigated Mr Field's allegations of infiltration, decided what to do, and done it, and satisfied itself that everything in Birkenhead is hunky-dory, and agreed a new selection timetable &dash. by the time all that has been done, the new rules will be in place, and Mr Field will be the first candidate to be chosen under the new system.

Woosnam has the longest backswing for putts of all lengths of any world-class player and on a bad week he sometimes decelerates into the ball, hitting it less firmly than he should. 
If he can avoid that, fame, to go alongside the fortunes that he has made, is his. 
Woosnam has drifted in the <tag>betting</>, having started at joint favourite with Nick Faldo at 7-1.

All the dark elitist mutterings about `Mickey Mouse" racing with only the bookmakers benefiting, will doubtless continue, but all-weather racing is a necessary extension of our sport that deserves to succeed. 
Principally it offers extra opportunities for those lower down the scale and that can hardly be a bad thing in an industry where there is such a yawning gap between top and bottom. 
<tag>BETTING</> on the Cesarewitch next Saturday is likely to be shaken up today by the news that Ray Cochrane has been booked to ride Guy Harwood's Royal Vote -three days after Harwood said the colt was a doubtful runner.   

700189
The main argument for the defendant was that he was unlikely to commit this sort of offence again, and so there was no need for a deterrent sentence to be passed. 
That overlooked the fact that the deterrent element in punishment for this sort of offence was not primarily to deter the offender himself, but to deter others. 
It was just this sort of office, the <tag>betting</> shop, which required protection by the court.   

700191
The two championship contenders slog it out today at Leicester, where Eddery has four booked rides to Cauthen's three.

The first indication that I had gone too far was a telephone call on Monday morning from my friend Ron Pollard of Ladbrokes. 
Queues of punters had formed in his <tag>betting</> shops, he said, putting their holiday money on The Soap Letters by myself, thus making it the 2-1 favourite to win the non-existent competition.

The fragility of the market was underlined by the small investments that sent Proud Patriot's odds tumbling. 
Put in originally at 7-1, a single wager of #100 reduced his odds to 5-1 and another <tag>bet</> of #100 trimmed the price to 3-1.

But not for long.

Perhaps our courts would take a different view to those of New Zealand. 
No doubt a bit of lobbying will result in an international understanding, even a convention, but it will be too late for some. 
It's a safe <tag>bet</> that broadcasters in New Zealand will soon be joined by others who hear this royalty-free programming opportunity knocking.

Horses on which large sums of money are bet, such as the Grand National or the Derby, they are horses that the bookies pay a great deal of attention to and the overround that they calculate &dash. they offer odds in such a way that you can't, by judiciously placing your bets, guarantee to win, and the overround is {vocal sond="um"} a thing that you can calculate which expresses, if you like, the average percentage in favour of the bookie on that race. 
Now this overround tends to be larger in fields with a large number of runners, and also tends to be larger in these popular races, so that at times when there's lots of money around the bookies, of course, and we expect them to do this, are very careful to make sure that the odds are well in their favour, because on these races where there's lots of money staked their risk is higher.

Friday's agreement, while welcome, should be seen as just a first small step along the road to giving stable staff not merely a decent, commercially competitive wage, but one that is commensurate with the effort they put in to keep a rich-man's show on the road.

With such as French Goblin and Garrison Savannah in opposition, Rustle certainly faces a far more searching examination than the former champion hurdler, Celtic Shot, who should have little more than an afternoon stroll if he stands up. 
Several talented Flat horses make their debuts in the opening novice hurdle, notably Lapierre, but it may be best to rely on the experience of Lady Rosanna (12.35). 
The most attractive <tag>bet</>, though, may be the classy AFARISTOUN (nap 1.45) who should have the legs of this opposition if anywhere near his best.

THE RELATIONSHIP between crown and flat green bowlers has long been somewhat contentious. 
Adherence to the northern crown code see the other lot, larger in number and mainly southern-based, floating primly up and down their rinks, clad in whites and uttering cries of `well bowled, Rodney". 
In contrast, the flat green players, on looking north, see an abundance of training shoes rather than proper bowling footwear and the development of a hard man's game, devoid of tactics but alive with bookies and <tag>betting</> slips.

One sensed that the crowd on Court Three had still not forgiven Jimmy Connors for beating Rosewall in the Wimbledon final of 15 years ago, denying the master-stroker the one Grand Slam title to have eluded him. 
The fare at Wimbledon on the outside courts is considered thin in the second week &dash. but apart from a Grand Slam champion within the next five years (if you can get a <tag>bet</> on Capriati), seeing so many champions of the past was a delight.

`If they are mounting this show because they think it has anything pertinent to say about the nation, then they have made an error of judgement.

The bookmakers William Hill re-opened betting on Ferguson's job security, quoting 7-4 on that he will be dismissed before the opening League match of 1990-91, 5-4 against that he remains in office. 
Before the start of this season, Hill's odds were 3-1 against Ferguson being sacked.

The former, a youth forlornly attempting stylishness with a lopsided flat-top of a haircut, is all gawky, laddish callowness. 
The latter, a musty middle-aged specimen of the male celibacy produced by the community in some profusion, witlessly keeps up what he regards as an impressive line in worldly knowingness. 
Further examples of the cramping effects of small-town Irish life soon come into view as well: spiteful, frustrated Molly who cleans the <tag>betting</> shop, wistful, dissatisfied Eileen who works there, and her father Stephen who owns it and paces rigidly around swathed in an overcoat and priggishness.

Both presupposed open policies in secondary education and the active pursuit of talents. 
This was a skilful vulgarization of the statistics of Robbins and the persuasiveness of Crowther and Newsom. 
Wilson was, as ever, careful to hedge his <tag>bets</>: grammar schools would disappear, he asserted, over his dead body and the fundamental purpose of the reform was represented as the extension to all of the opportunities of a grammar-school education.

It was through Blue Peter that for the first time I came into contact with the bookmakers" rule that the punter does not get the full multiplied odds about the same horse winning the 2,000 Guineas and the Derby. 
I have had a number of complaints from punters who have backed Nashwan to win both races and they feel they have been cheated when they did not receive the full multiplied odds when they went to draw their winnings. 
In most cases the backers had not checked their tickets before leaving the <tag>betting</> shop.

`I have taken this action to highlight how the punters in betting shops up and down the country are being robbed." 
Curley is calling for a government inquiry into the betting industry, and his anger is centred on the betting shows sent from the course to betting shops prior to a race.

The course has had a marketing problem in offering only Flat racing during the summer months, while Leopardstown has Flat and National Hunt meetings all the year round.

LAST MONDAY I suggested that the French colt, Machiavellian, then a 3-1 chance, might end up at 6-4 for the General Accident 2,000 Guineas if he wins the Prix Djebel on April 10 in approved style.

SAYYURE, the 5-4 favourite for the Saucy Kit Novice Hurdle at Doncaster yesterday, landed some substantial <tag>bets</> in easily accounting for Icarus by six lengths.   

700324
This is not the fallacy (although some allege it to be so) of Nigel Lawson's exchange rate policy, nor the fallacy (which others allege) of the money supply policy which Mrs Thatcher would prefer, but the fallacy of supposing government can be conducted successfully on the basis of ambiguous vacillation. 
Ambiguity concerning exchange rate policy offers markets the opportunities for the kind of one-way <tag>bets</> speculators like best.   

700325
Has Tony Adams, such a raw youth in Germany, become an adequate challenger to Butcher? 
Or is Paul Parker a safer <tag>bet</>?   

700327
Yesterday's hearing is the final leg of a trial which has included claims that an ultrasonic stun gun was invented to nobble race horses. 
James Laming, 49, a car dealer of Surrey Road, Peckham, south London, who was convicted last month of conspiring with Black to supply cocaine, claimed he knew Black only as the backer for his plans to undermine <tag>betting</> with the stun gun. 

700328
Brought up in Willesden, Miss Richardson left school at 15 and lived in squats in north London. 
There, she began abusing drugs and met up with a Belfast drop-out, Patrick Armstrong, who spent most of his days in Kilburn's <tag>betting</> shops.   

700329
They can't escape. 
Wherever they go, from pub to <tag>betting</> shop, boxing gala to charity dinner at the Savoy, fingers will point, yobs will yell, needles driven in.   

700331
The foot was bandaged yesterday and it is hoped that when the dressing is taken off this morning Nashwan will be able to be fitted with a shoe. 
Nashwan was 4-6 to become the third horse this century to win the Epsom Derby, 2,000 Guineas and Eclipse in the same year, the others being Diamond Jubilee in 1900 and Blue Peter 50 years ago. 
Ante-post <tag>betting</> has been postponed and if Nashwan and Indian Skimmer are absentees, at most there will be only five runners for Guy Harwood, who, besides Warning, has Ile de Chypre and Greensmith entered, says Greensmith runs only if Ile de Chypre does not. 

700333
Nothing daunted, Sir Ranulph Twistleton-Wykeham- Fiennes Bt., and Mike Stroud will set off once again in March. 
But although success for `North Pole 90 &dash. the last great challenge" may not seem a good <tag>bet</>, Sir Ranulph and his team have put together what the marketing men would call an impressive package.   

700335
His bid started to go wrong at the 12th hole and spluttered out at the 17th, the Road Hole, where many an aspiration had been snuffed out in the past. 
While they were being pinned back by the Old Course, one man was able to deliver the coupde-gra&circ.ce to St Andrews with a birdie finish, gently cajoled by an American renowned for catching golf balls in a baseball glove. 
I should have had a <tag>bet</> on Seve before the Open.

If they do this they will qualify for the discount or bonus shares." 
With only two working days to go in which to apply for shares in the 10 water companies, investors have to decide which of them look the best <tag>bets</>.   

700337
The deals may never have come to light had it not been for the fact that the council officers who undertook them backed the wrong horse in two ways. 
First, all but one of the transactions were to exchange the council's existing fixed interest rate position with a variable rate, effectively amounting to a <tag>bet</> on the future movement of interest rates.   

700338
Building work is in progress at the Dueling Grounds racecourse at Franklin in Kentucky on a site near an interstate highway. 
The extravagant prize money is available because the course is able to use its three per cent of <tag>betting</> turnover for a single meeting. 

700340
Wind generators also have the advantage that they can go on working 24 hours a day, where solar panels can only operate in sunlight. 
Serious cruising yachtsmen might consider hedging their <tag>bets</> by using a hybrid system as used on many of the trans oceanic racing yachts.

I just think now that age is a state of mind." 
Punters in a Ladbroke's <tag>betting</> shop in Gerrard Street, Soho, central London, pondering the selection yesterday for the 12.15pm race from the Happy Valley racecourse in Hong Kong, which was broadcast live by satellite for the first time.   

700345
The experimental rule says: `No player will be off-side if he receives the ball directly from his own half of the field." 
Klaus Allofs, the West German striker, just beat England's Chris Waddle in an opinion poll run by the sports daily l'Equipe to find the best foreign player in France. 
<tag>BETTING</> shops could soon be open in the evenings under Government proposals to deregulate trading hours. 

700346
After beating Ballyhane by seven lengths at Ascot in January, Mellor brought Zuko to Kempton a week ago, where he finished a game third to First Bout over an inadequate trip. 
Zuko's likely defection from Aintree has only marginally altered the <tag>betting</> on the race.   

700347
Dr Paliwoda's only big concern was `that they are moving with such speed and with such distaste for the previous regime that they might lose all sight of their objectives". 
The minute the interviews were over the Poles were back on the telephone, fixing the next business appointments, urging more British contact with the country where their former Communist comrades are tomorrow's 40 million prospective customers. 
IT IS A fair <tag>bet</> that if Mrs Thatcher were to draw up a comprehensive list of her European betes noires, the Social Charter would come very close to the top.   

700349
David Elsworth would doubtless provide an incontrovertibly eloquent case for the second part of that coveted double. 
But Michael Stoute, who can usually give a Trappist a run for his money, did a relatively effective job on behalf of Kribensis after Sheikh Mohammed's five-year-old had justified some of the heaviest <tag>betting</> seen on the course for some time, including wagers of #24,000-#33,000, #16,000-#22,000 and #20,000-#30,000 twice.   

700351
THE INVENTOR of an ultrasonic stun gun yesterday admitted he lied in court about the way it was used to `nobble" a racehorse. 
James Laming, 49, who is charged with conspiracy to supply drugs, has also been accused of using the device as a `smokescreen" to prove that his relationship with cocaine dealer Rene Black was only in connection with a <tag>betting</> fraud.   

700353
Ivernia also has interests in Ireland, where it expects to be granted a licence to mine base metals within the next few weeks, and is negotiating the possible purchase of an Australian gold mine from a company in the hands of the receiver. 
ROBERT GREEN, who resigned as chairman of William Hill bookmakers in the summer, is returning to UK gaming as chairman of an chain of <tag>betting</> shops called Surrey Racing.   

700354
American jump racing is very different to National Hunt racing in Britain in a number of ways. 
First, horse racing without betting is a foreign concept to us as we are blessed with the widest choice of bets and betting outlets in the world. 
But this does happen regularly in North America because the states are not united in their views on gambling, with some banning it completely while others only allow legal <tag>bets</> on racecourses.   

700355
United could strengthen their defence for the visit to Anfield by recalling Viv Anderson after 18 months of injury; Paul Ince could thus be freed to play in midfield against a Liverpool side to be selected from a first-team squad to which John Barnes, Steve Nicol, David Burrows and Steve Staunton return after injuries. 
The bookmakers William Hill re-opened <tag>betting</> on Ferguson's job security, quoting 7-4 on that he will be dismissed before the opening League match of 1990-91, 5-4 against that he remains in office. 

700357
Only Nashwan really did his stuff, his enormous stride proving to be an outstanding feature of his performance. 
The market on the course, where Warning drifted from 9-4 to 9-2 and Indian Skimmer from 100-30 to 11-2, was a foretaste of what was to come and made the ante-post prices on the two appear ridiculous. 
In the morning before he even left his office for the course, Victor Chandler had taken <tag>bets</> of #18,000 on Nashwan at 4-6 but coupled with that was a #35,000 to #10,000 Wood Dancer, who started at 9-4 in a later race.

`They're not really bookies these days, they're just debt collectors. 
They won't lay anyone a decent <tag>bet</> if they think he's capable of backing a winner."

I'm just applying my experience and know-how to what I'm doing." 
It's a fair <tag>bet</> that if a certain white horse could talk, he would put his hoof on his heart and say `Nobody does it better". 

700361
Picking the select few to make the transition from a successful playing career in football to television reporting has become a minor entertainment in itself. 
Football now has Bob Wilson of Arsenal and Emlyn Hughes of Liverpool and on independent television there is Ian StJohn and Jimmy Greaves (`The Saint and Greavsie"), who have taken the art of televised sport a step further by reproducing in the studio all the mixture of jokes and outlandish memories, <tag>bets</>, hunches, tactical shrewdness, and affectionate `piss-taking" that make up a friendly hour in the pub.   

700366
Savers in Abbey National were given 100 shares which are now worth #178. 
The best <tag>bet</> now looks to be the Alliance &and. Leicester.

And he attacks the outgoing administration as `corrupt, illegitimate and incompetent". 
But the <tag>betting</> continues undiminished at the gambling booths while the fickle crowd waits for the real draw &dash. a free show by one of Brazil's top rock groups. 

700368
So you will exercise some skill. 
I'm taking here about pure, blind <tag>betting</> of someone who is not attempting to exercise any skill but is just looking at the odds offered by the bookies, and pointing out &dash. and I'll have a table to demonstrate this in the talk I give at the Open Day &dash. the way in which the rate of return on bets made in this way decreases steadily the longer the odds are offered. 

700369
The Newmarket gallops attract more pairs of binoculars than a rare bird watch these days, and the sight of Be My Chief flying past fellow equine blue bloods at home meant he was sent off at 4-9 for his first race, which he won by three lengths from Balla Cove at Doncaster in May. 
Even if he had never run again this season, that form would be good enough to occupy a prominent ledge in the 2,000 Guineas ante-post <tag>betting</>; Balla Cove went on to win one Classic trial, the Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket, while concertinaed finishes like that of another, Newmarket's Dewhurst Stakes, are seldom fought out by virtuosos.   

700373
The nation's bookies will soon be offering the chance to back your favourite share in a hand-to-hand gladiatorial battle against another share. 
An innovative betting scheme, which has been operating in the South of England, goes nationwide at the end of next week. 
The bookies will take <tag>bets</> on individual matches between two shares of as little as 25p. 

700374
He thinks credit contraction will need a strong deflationary cause. 
His current <tag>bet</> is that the culprit may be peace.   

700375
Before the glamour of the cup comes today's league programme, in which every club will be hoping to emerge unscathed on the injury front. 
WHEN Essendon and Melbourne meet tomorrow in the Foster's Cup final at the Oval, it is a fair <tag>bet</> that at least 200 of the crowd will be trying to pick up tips and tactics as much as enjoying the game.   

700376
TOM COLLINS, of Leeds, is given little chance of taking the World Boxing Council light-heavyweight title from Australia's Jeff Harding when they meet here tonight. 
<tag>Betting</> on fights is prohibited in Queensland, but bookmakers in Las Vegas, where the fight is being shown on cable television, rate Collins a 6-2 outsider.   

700377
`She felt in a wave of terror the grey, gritty hopelessness of it all." 
How she wishes she were back in her snug little house, tapping away on her word-processor, dissecting the lexemes of some classic Victorian novel, delicately detaching the hermeneutic code from the proairetic code, the cultural from the symbolic, surrounded by books and files, the gas fire hissing and a cup of coffee steaming at her elbow. 
She passes launderettes, hairdressers, <tag>betting</> shops, Sketchleys, Motaparts, Currys, a Post Office, a DIY Centre, a Denture Centre, an Exhaust Centre.   

700381
Rain went to Fred, doubtful whether he deserved to be patted and greeted affectionately for displaying his fine homing instinct or treated with contempt for the trouble he had caused. 
He provided his own solution, leaping up to lick her face, a treat she fended off in the nick of time. 
`I <tag>bet</> he gets that from his owners," said Holly, locking her car. 

700383
Barry Hills has his horses in great form at the moment and his newcomer Singing shouldwin the New Ham Maiden Stakes. 
BETTING may be a mug's game, but there are surely some things in life that are certainties. 
For example, a stroll into the Portsmouth <tag>betting</> tent before play yesterday would have revealed odds of 9-2 against Robin Smith taking Lancashire for a hundred.  

700384
Course management privately leaked the proposals as they called publicly for the racing authorities to direct more resources on to the Republic's three largest racecourses &dash. Leopardstown, the Curragh and Phoenix Park &dash. and reduce aid to, and perhaps close, venues such as Fairyhouse and Navan. 
Phoenix management also want <tag>betting</> restrictions relaxed on the course.   

700385
You can cut your premiums substantially by accepting reduced benefits. 
Budget plans which offer in-patient treatment only are much cheaper and can be a good <tag>bet</>, provided that you are aware of their limitations at the outset.   

700386
Legislation to outlaw such transactions would probably follow. 
Yesterday, John Howell, concluding the case for the district auditor who is seeking to have the dealings ruled beyond the power of the local authority, described the transactions as no different to placing <tag>bets</> on interest movements with a bookmaker.   

700388
Patrick Macnee, Loni Anderson and Hall Holbrook head the cast. 
Women can't resist a hunky TV weatherman, so his envious mates set him a high-stakes <tag>bet</>: three months to get engaged to three women they choose.   

700389
Golden Pheasant began the season with Clive Brittain and finished 2 1/2 lengths second to Old Vic in the Chester Vase and that is the nearest any horse has got to Old Vic this season. 
In England where the top prize of the day of #43,797 for the Northumberland Plate at Newcastle seems paltry compared with what our overseas runners were collecting, Guy Harwood gained another success in a long distance handicap with Orpheus, the only 3-year-old in the race. 
Orpheus had appeared so well handicapped that when the ante-post <tag>betting</> opened he was made the 9-4 favourite. 

700390
Scented Goddess (2.30), placed in her three races so far, should be good enough to cope with present company. 
Put Berry's Bold Spark in a forecast, for the youngster is his only runner here. 
At Doncaster the best <tag>bet</> on the card in my view is Luca Cumani's King Cracker (4.45).

THURSDAY: 
Bookmakers welcome news that <tag>betting</> shops may be opened in the evenings under Government proposals to deregulate trading hours.   

700393
Yet big crowds &dash. up to 20,000 people attended Callaway Gardens racecourse in Georgia for the second leg of the Challenge on 19 November &dash. were common this year for the the 40 jump meetings that took place, almost all of them at weekends. 
Illegal <tag>betting</> does take place but it is a sideline.  

700395
Few bookmakers would continue to close at 6.30pm given the choice, as most would hope to catch people leaving work. 
`Unquestionably <tag>betting</> shops will open in the evenings," Dillon added.   

700396
Mr De Klerk is certainly under considerable pressure to do so as the first step in the search for a negotiated settlement. 
The reaction of the Department of Prisons to his application will be an indication of official thinking; it is a fair <tag>bet</> that Mr De Klerk will be consulted. 

700397
But the bookies usually claim to know a thing or two about the running, and favourites are not always what they seem. 
In the more usual <tag>betting</> world earlier this month, hot favourite Desert Orchid finished third in the Cheltenham Gold Cup, disappointing thousands of punters but leaving the bookies smiling from ear to ear.   

700398
Yet, at the same time, Churchill's budgets were balanced only by sleight of hand. 
He raided the Road fund which had accumulated a surplus; juggled with the Sinking fund ; advanced the date for the payment of income tax ; and allowed the unemployment insurance fund to run steadily into debt. 
His budget speeches provided much entertainment and some futile expedients, such as the attempt to tax <tag>betting</>.   

700400
And the scenes became considerably uglier when they returned to the unsaddling enclosure, with more sustained jeering, and cries of `cheat". 
Hugo Bevan, the clerk of the course, reported numerous abusive phone calls from what he described as `the usual nutters" after the race and said he expected to receive more in the evening. 
And a foolhardy young employee of Tote Credit was suspended after writing `Was this fixed?" under the race result in the company's course <tag>betting</> shop.

She ran a marvellous race when third to Runun over the course recently. 
THE JOCKEY CLUB yesterday meted out the stiff punishment of a 20-year ban from racing to Chris Willett, a point-to-point rider and trainer, who served a three-month jail sentence earlier this year for his part in a <tag>betting</> coup involving a ringer.

Ragworm and limpet top baits. 
Langstone and Portsmouth harbours best <tag>bet</> for a few flounder, with Eastern Roadd, Porchester and the Oyster Beds top areas.

Naturally, therefore, those who supported the League distrusted armaments and, still more, the arguments of those who relied on them. 
In practice both sides hedged their <tag>bets</>.   

700406
The publicity the case has attracted may bring a windfall for the author &dash. his publishers are already planning a reprint in paperback &dash. but for racing, the consequences could be serious. 
A spokesman for the Betting Office Licensees Association said: `We feel horrified because this is a threat to destroy the integrity of horse racing." 
William Hill, Britain's largest chain of <tag>betting</> shops, said: `To say we are worried is something of an understatement.   

700407
Actually, Ernest devotees may well be disappointed, since, as a cab-driver (a pivotal figure in American whimsy these days &dash. see also Scrooged and Wired, though Ernest manages to be worse, much worse than either of these), he is really playing second banana to Santa (aka the Big Red One). 
At all events, they should catch the film while they can, for it is a fair <tag>bet</> that he will not longer be saving Christmas come 25 December.   

700409
I think that it is much easier to create that atmosphere in a good out-of-town theatre like Plymouth rather than to prepare a star vehicle in a draughty rehearsal room somewhere in London." 
If theatre artists of this calibre are prepared to launch a production from Plymouth, it seems a fair <tag>bet</> that the Theatre Royal management has got its act together.   

700412
For the second year running, today's doubles final will be between Leamington professional Kevin Sheldon, partnered by Howell, against the seemingly invincible pair of Deuchar and fellow Australian Wayne Davies, who are aiming for their sixth consecutive title. 
The British pair, beaten in straight sets last year, are not expected to fare any better against the greatest double act in the game's history, but the manner of their semi-final success against Mick Dean, the Radley schoolmaster, and Ronaldson should prevent complacency by the No. 1 seeds. 
THERE have been many fears expressed recently about weak <tag>betting</> markets at all-weather meetings leading to manipulation of prices by bookmakers. 

700413
Some of their venture capital arms are either arranging deals which include mezzanine or investing in specialist firms or funds which provide it.

It seemed to him unlikely that he would ever feel anything for any woman. 
Their apparent rapport had not gone unremarked elsewhere in the room, and since the consensus among the magic four hundred was that Victoria Hamilton was a good thing and a safe <tag>bet</>, more invitations pairing her with Richard followed in brisk succession.   

700417
Last year's winner, Quinlan Terry, would not have beaten the second horse, the subsequent Group One race winner Ile De Chypre, had that rival not been drawn on the far side. 
The heaviest <tag>betting</> this year has been for Shellac, a six-length winner from Sudden Victory at Ayr last time out, but the deciding factor is that Dettori originally chose to ride SPLENDID CAREER (nap 3.35), who may have been unlucky when beaten at Newbury by yesterday's Goodwood winner Monastery. 

700418
Some maintained a rights issue would accompany the year's profit announcement, due later this month. 
Others maintained Britain's biggest brewer planned to sell its Coral <tag>betting</> shop chain in a #400m management buyout.

But there is a feeling among lawyers who deal with censorship that things will start to move rather faster under Mr de Klerk. 
The betting is that Playboy, if submitted to Professor van Rooyen's scrutiny, will get the nod &dash. perhaps then helping pave the way for political change once whites see that a rape epidemic does not follow. 
The <tag>betting</> also is that Dry White Season will be approved for general viewing, again helping the process by awakening the typically closeted white population to the prevailing injustices.

Among those in the running for Europe's most prestigious visual arts award, are Gillian Ayres, for her `mature paintings"; Lucian Freud, for the `continuing innovation and uncompromising beauty of the ambitious paintings"; Richard Long, `for the enduring influence and importance of his sculpture"; Giuseppe Penone, `for his remarkable exhibitions"; Paula Rego, `for the continuing development and haunting presence of her recent figurative paintings"; Sean Scully, `for the moving affirmation of abstract painting"; and Richard Wilson, `for the evocative site-specific installations".

As far as I'm concerned, Lindsay Clarke's wonderful The Chymical Wedding won the Whitbread Prize &dash. a book I reviewed in the Daily Mail long before I was invited to be a Whitbread judge, ending my review with the words, `You are turning the pages of a modern masterpiece. 
I lay a #10 <tag>bet</> that it will be shortlisted for the Booker Prize."

The current spell of fine weather is starting to worry Malton trainer John Parkes, who has issued a warning that Call Collect will not run at Aintree if the going becomes firm by Saturday. 
The nine-year-old former Irish Flat race and point-to-point winner sits alongside Brown Windsor at the head of most ante-post <tag>betting</> lists after being consistently supported since his brilliant Christies Foxhunter Chase victory at last month's Cheltenham National Hunt Festival.

The news that the pools <tag>betting</> tax will be cut and around #100 million diverted to help League clubs carry out the recommendations of the Taylor report has been widely welcomed within the game.

Kim Bailey's Man O'Magic, recent winner of the H &and.

So the explanation for the paper's idiosyncratic approach to stories about the Royal Family &dash. the separation of the Princess Royal and Captain Mark Phillips, and the birth of each of Andy and Fergie's two daughters rated just one paragraph on an inside page &dash. is a simple one: `I hate stories about royal hangers-on."

As a star opera director whose career is becoming increasingly orientated towards the theatre, it is understandable that he hasn't often found the time to stray from the great metropolises to mount a production. 
Yet here he was, a man who is a reasonable outside <tag>bet</> for the vacant crown at the RSC, reading favourable reviews for his previous work, Another Time with Albert Finney (which had opened the night before in the West End), and preparing to rehearse in a Methodist Hall in the middle of Wesley country.
