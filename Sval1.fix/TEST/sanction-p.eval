How is it that the United States' (and British) military machine &dash. more American troops and weapons than in Europe at the height of the cold war &dash. is pounding away, day after day, at a low-tech Third World enemy? 
Of course, it was a great achievement that the United Nations reacted so promptly to the invasion of Kuwait by a dictator capable of almost infinite nastiness. 
Compared with all other invasions &dash. China in Tibet, Indonesia in East Timor, Israel in the Lebanon, etc &dash. it was heartwarming to witness the way in which the world community was taking a stand against an act of gross injustice and imposing unprecedented economic <tag>sanctions</>.

Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International, the European arm of the big Japanese investment house, said he expected the German economy to expand by 3.5 per cent in 1990 after growing by about 4 per cent this year. 
Although he agreed that the Bundesbank, the German central bank, would not <tag>sanction</> another interest rate rise, Mr MacKinnon said: `My guess is that it won't be long before we have a crossover where German rates stand higher than US rates, especially if the Federal Reserve eases policy further."

Then, far from apologising over the British statement, with its firm rejection of <tag>sanctions</>, Mrs Thatcher went on to attack other Commonwealth countries.

It was a confused election.

Relations between the ANC and Inkatha have been hostile in recent years, in large measure as a consequence of the virtual state of war that exists in Natal province &dash. hundreds have died in the last year &dash. between Inkatha and the United Democratic Front, allies of the exiled ANC. 
Furthermore, Mr Buthelezi's opposition to engaging in violence with the state and his stance against international economic <tag>sanctions</> are in stark contrast to ANC policy.

Commenting that external confidence about standards in the City `appears to be at a very low level, some have suggested at an all-time low", the board says that it would seem to be an important element in strengthening client confidence in the financial services industry that the overall vigour of monitoring investment businesses and enforcement of any disciplinary proceedings `should be more apparent than it has been hitherto. 
This probably also points to the need for emphasis on speedy investigation of suspected breaches and a readiness to impose disciplinary <tag>sanctions</> that are as timely, as tough and overt as is consistent with fairness".   

700016
THE European Community, in a significant softening of its position, yesterday praised South Africa's President F. W. de Klerk for his reforms, and said sanctions could be gradually relaxed. 
True to her instincts, Mrs Thatcher, who has campaigned for the easing of international sanctions against South Africa, emerged from the conference table to insist that she had won her battle for `the principle of a gradual relaxation of sanctions". 
However, she added: `I think it is a great pity that the 12 were unable to agree publicly to make a start now in easing <tag>sanctions</> against South Africa.

Somewhat surprisingly, the California Court balked, invoking the whole litany of arguments against non-pecuniary damages that they had consistently contemned in the past. 
The resulting distinction between injury and death, which was challenged on constitutional grounds,{fo id=192} was explained as resting on the rational basis that, in the case of death, there would otherwise have been no <tag>sanction</> against the tortfeasor and that this provided the only means by which the family unit could recover compensation for loss of parental care and services, whereas in case of injury `the tangible aspects of the child's loss can be compensated in the parent's own cause of action".

Tommy Hindley, a diminutive character who can be found shouldering bazooka lenses to the tennis courts of the world, is an exception. 
It has been Hindley's professional good fortune and personal ill-luck to have been at courtside to record the best and worst of John McEnroe, during which he has experienced more than his share of flak.

General Noriega tried to isolate opposition within the military after a similar coup attempt last year by promoting loyal officers to the important Strategic Military Council and General Staff, and retiring those thought to be less enthusiastic in their support of him.

American law relies much more than the law of other countries on private initiative for law enforcement. 
This is reflected both in the much greater support of private causes of action for damages in addition to criminal <tag>sanctions</> than in England,{fo id=116} and in the numerous incentives for private law enforcement under prohibitory legislation such as treble damages, ranging from anti-trust to anti-racketeering statutes.

Mr de Klerk's announcement is being seen as recognition finally that the South African government will have to deal with the black majority through the leadership of the ANC if civil war is not to wipe the republic off the face of Africa.

This statement said the Commonwealth should concentrate on encouraging change rather than further punishment &dash. though in the majority declaration the Commonwealth said the purpose of sanctions was not to punish, but to apply pressure for change. 
The British statement said sanctions contributed to misery and poverty in South Africa and did not have the political effects claimed. 
Britain said the effect of tightening financial <tag>sanctions</> as proposed by the Commonwealth would be to increase resistance to change rather than encourage it.

President Bush and his Secretary of State, Mr Jim Baker, have made it clear that their `measured response" against China was taken because the White House believes the long-term strategic importance of the relationship with China should outweigh any immediate reaction to the massacre in Tienanmen Square. 
But American businessmen now complain that the President's limited trade sanctions on military exports are having a far more sweeping impact than originally envisaged.

Speaking after the EC meeting in Luxembourg yesterday, the Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, seemed confident that the existing European ban on new investment would be lifted either at the Dublin summit or shortly after.

The law is one source of such principles.

The election of FW de Klerk as president is a sign of progress, they say, and the imminent release of Walter Sisulu and the apparent movement towards negotiations are signs of a new atmosphere. 
Britain wants to encourage movement, not to stifle it, and any talk of sanctions would be bound to have a bad effect. 
Yet even the British acknowledge that there are individuals and countries `wedded to <tag>sanctions</>", and according to Commonwealth officials, Britain may well again find itself in a minority of one when the subject is debated.

The other world issue in which Britain has to be directly involved is with Argentina over the Falklands, but that is no longer a priority.

Rugby, they also keep telling us, is a players' game and if the IB members do not then make a gesture towards them, the players could well take the regulations into their own hands. 
`I hope you move into the 1990s with a lot of new decisions," the New Zealand captain Wayne Shelford, who by his own officially <tag>sanctioned</> circumvention of the rules already does very nicely out of the game, told the administrators as the tour finished.   

700091
But though it was an historic meeting, a delegation five years ago having been snubbed by her, there seems to have been no breakthrough towards a common position on steps to force an end to apartheid. 
One of the three-person delegation, Mr Azhar Cachalia, described the half-hour discussion as `cordial but frank, with no punches pulled." 
Both sides agreed that apartheid must go, said Mr Cachalia, but disagreed about the need for comprehensive mandatory <tag>sanctions</>. 

700092
`We need to find carrots, not just sticks," Mrs Thatcher told a slightly mystified audience. 
The Prime Minister said <tag>sanctions</> only worked by increasing poverty and said she had heard of a British-run pineapple canning plant forced to lay off 1,100 black workers because people in the US and Canada would not buy South African products.   

700093
That at least keeps American options open. 
At the same meeting Mr Cohen conceded that: `Sanctions have played a role in stimulating new thinking within the white power structure" &dash. a concession also made by the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Gerhardus De Kock, and the ruling National Party. 
In its manifesto for the September election, the NP declared: `Boycotts, <tag>sanctions</> and disinvestment have strained the economy of the country and every business and household." 

700094
The increase, the second since the Anglo-Swedish partners launched their original dollars 824m offer in May, followed the overnight decision of a Bermudian court which refused to extend an injunction preventing Sea Containers subsidiaries from buying further shares in their parent company. 
A previous ruling by the Chief Justice, Sir James Astwood, had <tag>sanctioned</> their share-buying, giving them the right to vote their collective 20 per cent holding in favour of the Sea Containers restructuring.   

700095
In its manifesto for the September election, the NP declared: `Boycotts, sanctions and disinvestment have strained the economy of the country and every business and household." 
Mrs Thatcher is alone in not acknowledging the effect of sanctions. 
`Britain does not agree that <tag>sanctions</> have the political effects claimed for them," read her statement in Kuala Lumpur. 

700096
`South Africans will themselves decide the country's future. 
There is no doubt that a considerable majority of all South Africans are opposed to <tag>sanctions</>," Mr Botha declared.   

700097
DRT is now the third largest accounting firm measured on worldwide fee income, behind Ernst and Young and Peat Marwick, the two other mega-mergers of the last three years. 
THE Government yesterday signalled its willingness to <tag>sanction</> a further increase in the value of the pound, despite a surge which has already seen it climb nearly 7 per cent against a basket of international currencies over the last two months. 

700098
His Defence Secretary, Dick Cheney, seemed to pave the way for such a move with his surprise proposals last weekend for a significant cut in US defence spending. 
The Bush-Thatcher agenda also includes regional issues, such as the problem of boat people in Hong Kong and economic <tag>sanctions</> against South Africa, but the main topic will be changes in Eastern Europe and possible Gorbachev arms control moves.   

700099
The widespread anger among GPs over the deal was reflected in a no-confidence motion in Dr Wilson yesterday, which he survived by 49 votes to 19. 
A working party which had been considering <tag>sanctions</> concluded that anything the GPs could do that would be effective would either harm patients or be a breach of their contracts, Dr Wilson said.   

700100
Foreign companies will be able to place their shares much more easily in the US without having to adhere to the onerous US accounting rules. 
Rule 144a will provide much greater liquidity to the private placement market by <tag>sanctioning</> the trading of these equities between institutions.   

700101
He knows that that switch will almost certainly mean war. 
<tag>Sanctions</> cannot possibly `work" in the time he can allow for maintaining half a million men in combat readiness thousands of miles from home and for keeping his public opinion with him.   

700102
The way in which Iraq has escaped international censure for its human rights violations is even more remarkable. 
Although Iraq has been listed as among those third-world states to have acquired chemical weapons, no international governmental forum has chosen to impose <tag>sanctions</> or even condemn it for using them against its own population.   

700103
He was advised that payments on the transactions would have to be stopped immediately, or the councillors agreeing to them would face the risk of surcharge and disqualification. 
On 28 February, the Secretary of State for the Environment, refused to give his <tag>sanction</> to any payments being made.   

700104
But there have been casualties in the fight for profitability and market share. 
Some of the 24,000 who lost their jobs in the shake-up are critical of the Gomez management method which, they say, <tag>sanctions</> heavy redundancies among the rank and file but has not the guts to cut down senior management.   

700105
While pledging to fight pollution and spend more on social welfare, the government's political programme for the next four years has kept the outgoing team's ambitious income tax cut plan for 1990 in place. 
It pledges to sustain economic gains by cutting deficit spending and to freeze defence spending beginning in 1991. 
On foreign policy, the coalition accord gives the new government more freedom to impose fresh <tag>sanctions</> on South Africa if Pretoria does not end apartheid.   

700106
Photograph (omitted): A Malaysian soldier stands guard outside the Putra World Trade Centre in Kuala Lumpur where the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting begins tomorrow. 
Calls for more <tag>sanctions</> against South Africa will again be high on the agenda   

700107
Five months later, three justices were defeated at the polls. 
If this denouement has any moral, it is that judges who abandon the tradition of open-mindedness and neutrality in pursuit of their own political agenda risk being treated for what they are &dash. politicians &dash. and, in a democracy, liable to the <tag>sanctions</> of popular displeasure.  

700108
The British statement was intended to show Britain's positive response and to chart the way ahead. 
Mr Major said the whole thrust of the Commonwealth communique signed by all member countries was that punitive sanctions were ineffectual. 
`The whole thrust of the statement is that for the first time we have actually dragged other people in our direction in acknowledging the futility of punitive <tag>sanctions</> and acknowledging that progressively they must be dismantled.   

700109
He glances nervously over his shoulder. 
WASHINGTON (Reuter) &dash. President George Bush yesterday approved the export of three satellites to China and lifted prohibitions on financing US business with China, removing an important part of <tag>sanctions</> imposed after the crackdown on demonstrators in Peking last June.   

700110
NELSON Mandela arrived today at 10 Downing Street for lunchtime discussions with Mrs Thatcher. 
Anti-apartheid campaigners greeted the deputy president of the African National Congress with chanting and singing. 
High on the agenda for the discussions were be the issue of <tag>sanctions</> and the ANC's continued commitment to the armed struggle.   

700111
Major Owens was one of the handful of mostly Black and Latino lawmakers willing to oppose the war during two days of nationally televised Congressional debates. 
They opted instead for continued UN <tag>sanctions</> and negotiations.  

700112
A large demand for money might scare members and prompt them to leave Lloyd's. 
Lloyd's now wants its agents to abandon this practice, unless there are very good reasons for it. 
A range of <tag>sanctions</> are being introduced which could affect an underwriting agent's business.   

700113
It is called insurance. 
Before the `competent authority" <tag>sanctions</> any release into the environment it should stipulate that the releaser has to take out an insurance policy that will cover it for any consequential damage to the environment and necessary clean-up operations.   

700114
They also still had the Abyssinian affair on their hands. 
Economic <tag>sanctions</> had been intended as a bluff, a solemn warning to Mussolini.  

700115
He turns 72 on July 18, the day he is scheduled to return home. 
Earlier yesterday in Geneva Mr Mandela addressed the International Labour Organisation (ILO), telling 2,000 conference delegates that <tag>sanctions</> had to be maintained, despite this week's decision by the South African government to partially lift the state of emergency.   

700116
We were unable to meet with the Chairwoman of the Iraqi Women's Federation, Manal Younis, as at the time she was on a ship bound for Iraq with a cargo of medicines and milk. 
(Since UN <tag>sanctions</> against Iraq were imposed, over 4,300 people have died in Iraq from lack of medicines.)   

700117
There is little doubt that he is also here on official business. 
Before leaving, he consulted Mr Bush and will report back to the White House. 
While under strong congressional pressure to maintain <tag>sanctions</> and a ban on high-level contacts with China, Mr Bush has made it clear that he favours normalising relations with Peking.   

700118
And some of them want most of the money to go to Eastern Europe. 
As they bicker, Panama is flat broke. 
America's economic <tag>sanctions</> failed to dislodge General Manuel Noriega but squeezed the economy dry; the invasion that did dislodge him left a war-battered city, with some 18,000 people homeless and unemployment soaring.   

700119
`There certainly was some tension at the end," one said. 
Even in the closing hours, the argument over <tag>sanctions</> against South Africa, which had bedevilled the private debates, went on with Brian Mulroney of Canada publicly contradicting Mrs Thatcher, who said no one had complained directly to her about Britain's decision to issue its own separate statement on South Africa, in apparent contradiction to the official conference communique.   

700120
Twenty-Sixth Report of the Select Committee on European Legislation, Charter of Fundamental Social Rights; HMSO #5.10 
MONTHS of accumulated suspicion and antagonism between the Church and State came to a head in the early hours of yesterday morning when the House of Commons rejected a measure, <tag>sanctioned</> by the General Synod, to allow the ordination of divorced men as priests.   

700121
`But this is now very much the consensus opinion." 
The tone of yesterday's discussion contrasted strongly with the assurances given to Mr Mandela during his recent EC tour that there would be no early lifting of the limited <tag>sanctions</>. 

700122
NELSON Mandela was today anxious to mend fences after his unguarded remarks about talks with the IRA yesterday angered just about every politician he is to meet on his trip to Britain. 
But he is still in line for a lecture from Mrs Thatcher, who is likely to tell him a few home truths about Northern Ireland and reiterate Government refusal to hold any talks with terrorists. 
Before he flew into Heathrow's VIP terminal late last night from Dublin he went out of his way to back off from the row unleashed by his remarks about the IRA, with the threat that it could overshadow his call to keep up <tag>sanctions</> against apartheid. 

700123
The Abyssinian affair had split the Left. 
The Communist party had supported <tag>sanctions</>, in obedience to Soviet policy; the I.L.P. opposed them on pacifist grounds; the Socialist League opposed them with Marxist arguments.   

700124
Mr Hurd was due to meet government and opposition leaders including De Klerk before flying to Namibia for celebrations marking its independence from South Africa. 
But he was not expected to meet African National Congress deputy president Nelson Mandela, who has criticised Britain's stance on <tag>sanctions</>.  

700125
This recommendation follows a request from the Wales TUC. 
A Tory councillor, Jeff Sainsbury, however, said that taking <tag>sanctions</> against the WRU would achieve nothing.   

700126
China's abstention also won it freedom from `US concern" over its dismal human rights record and any criticism of its ongoing prosecution of prominent pro-democracy activists. 
Meanwhile, while not officially <tag>sanctioning</> the use of force against Iraq, China's  curry-favouring bolstered its future bid for `Third World" leadership. 

700127
The American-designed M16s are manufactured under licence in Singapore, but it is unclear who pays for them. 
US officials deny that any American money is used to pay for arms, which, unless <tag>sanctioned</> by Congress, would be against US law.   

700128
In the first phase, States created themselves in, as it were, a vacuum, a State-less environment. 
In all subsequent cases, national liberation was the route to enter an established system of States (which <tag>sanctioned</> the newcomer).   

700129
They also agree on foreign policy. 
While the British leader is roundly criticised by other African states for refusing to apply economic <tag>sanctions</> against South Africa, Dr Banda supports Mrs Thatcher, heading the only African government to have full diplomatic relations and open economic ties with South Africa.   

700130
The US holds frozen Iranian assets possibly totalling dollars 4bn, ( #2.5bn) but the Bush administration is refusing to refusing to release them while Americans are still held in Lebanon. 
MANAMA &dash. Iran's parliament has approved a draft bill <tag>sanctioning</> the arrest of US citizens found guilty in Tehran of endangering Iranian lives or interests, UPI reports.   

700131
Its recognition in the international community, triggered by President Bush last week, puts pressure on the South African Government to meet the demand of the ANC and anti-apartheid groups inside the country to lift the banning of all organisations and individuals. 
In Washington, the delegation appealed for `maximum pressure" against South Africa, including <tag>sanctions</>, the blocking of trade credits, stopping renegotiation of South Africa's debt, and maintaining the ban on new loans and investment.   

700132
During the President's visit to Gdansk, the Solidarity leader, Mr Lech Walesa, warned Mr Bush that, without significant Western aid, the streets of Gdansk could become another Tiananmen Square. 
The Americans are hoping that a common front of the capitalist powers could avoid the danger of trade rivals stepping in to fill the gap in the Chinese market left by the US arms embargo. 
One persuasive argument against wider trade <tag>sanctions</> against China has been the danger that Japan and less squeamish Western nations might move in.   

700133
This sort of structure would look bad enough in Basingstoke or Milton Keynes, but slap in the heart of the only city in Britain designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation as a World Heritage Site (a distinction it shares with Venice, Florence, the Palace of Versailles and the Taj Mahal) it is, of course, complete insanity. 
It is hard to imagine the city fathers of Venice agreeing to a Waitrose supermarket in the Piazza San Marco, or Florence <tag>sanctioning</> the building of a shopping mall on the Piazza della Signoria, but this is in effect what has happened in Bath.   

700134
These were not much more than rationalizations. 
The government, and the British people, had said: all <tag>sanctions</> short of war. 

700135
Thus demand number one is a curb on criticism of the South African Government and apartheid. 
Pretoria also wants Mozambique to become a buffer against stepped-up <tag>sanctions</>. 

700136
However, it has an atmosphere that is like the one we  might have had, if the Earth had been a little closer to the sun. 
That is, a surface of molten rock, and a thick, choking atmospheric of biting clouds of sulphuric acid. 
<tag>SANCTIONS</> against South Africa should be maintained until apartheid is dismantled, says the Bishop of Oxford, the Rt Rev Richard Harries. 

700137
THE Auto Cycle Council of Australia has threatened legal action over plans to move the Australian Grand Prix from Phillip Island to Sydney. 
The ACCA refuses to <tag>sanction</> the event at any other location, and Sydney, despite claiming rights to stage the race for the next four years, has yet to build a Grand Prix circuit.   

700138
The British line has been that there is a huge difference between the image of Britain accepted in South Africa and the reality. 
Officials said that President de Klerk was severely shaken by his meetings with Mrs Thatcher and Sir Geoffrey Howe, then Foreign Secretary. 
`There seems to be an idea in South Africa that Britain will protect the country in the Security Council and fight against the imposition of <tag>sanctions</>.   

700139
Chief Buthulezi doesn't believe in sanctions. 
Helen Suzman doesn't believe in sanctions. 
Alan Paton didn't believe in <tag>sanctions</>.   

700140
In 1933 Dr Max Grunhu&umlaut.t was dismissed by the Nazis from his Chair in Criminal Law at the University of Bonn. 
He fled to Oxford, bringing with him a concern to study how the criminal law affects the lives of those subject to its <tag>sanctions</>: an approach then entirely foreign to British legal scholars.  

700141
He said the reforms to date were only `an interim situation". 
Yesterday's EC statement acknowledged the importance of foreign investment once a new political settlement had been agreed &dash. a point which British officials seized upon as consistent with the Thatcher line. 
The Prime Minister declared that the future was only as promising as it is for South Africa `because some of us stood out the entire time against comprehensive <tag>sanctions</> and won".   

700142
Americans admit that they have spent vast sums of money to help the Contras wage war against the government and the people who supported it. 
In addition, they also applied severe economic sanctions against Nicaragua. 
Who now will say that economic <tag>sanctions</> and international terrorism do not work? 

700143
The trouble is that no-one really knows. 
Without the ultimate <tag>sanction</> of Soviet tanks, the Polish Communist party crumbled at the elections, but it is in everyone's interests not to let it go out of business.   

700144
Harry Carpenter, who was a fairly old-fashioned high churchman was quite as clear in his mind as Archbishop Fisher and Princess Margaret had been in theirs when faced with a parallel dilemma. 
`Mindful of the Church's teachings", as they then stood, he said that there was no possibility of allowing Mrs Gresham, a divorced woman, to be given a church marriage. 
The fact that her bridegroom was a famous Christian apologist made the case all the more impossible, for the marriage would undoubtedly attract publicity, and if it should be known that it had received the bishop's <tag>sanction</>, he would have been flooded with requests by couples in similar positions, anxious to bend the rules to fit their own particular cases.   

700146
Lenin was willing to make concessions, but not on the centralized unity of the party &dash. `we must not weaken the force of our offensive by breaking into numerous independent political parties; we must not introduce estrangement and isolation and then have to heal an artificially implanted disease with the aid of these notorious `federal", plasters". 
At this stage, he was firmly opposed to federation; `Federation is harmful because it <tag>sanctions</> segregation and alienation, elevates them to a principle, to a law." 

700147
At the same time, General Noriega had been flirting with the Soviet Union and, according to US intelligence sources, continues to receive arms from Moscow. 
In spite of the sharp recession induced by US economic <tag>sanctions</>, General Noriega has played a skilful game of counter-propaganda. 

700148
HONG KONG, disappointed and demoralised at the end of Sir Geoffrey Howe's three-day emergency visit, was still resounding to the clamour of marches and demonstrations last night as his plane transported him to Britain's calmer shores. 
A farewell dinner for Sir Geoffrey at the Governor's residence was marred by a demonstration outside of more than 10,000 people. 
After the organisers had handed in a petition calling on Britain to step up <tag>sanctions</> against China, and had left, many of the demonstrators stayed to chant the word `shame" in English and denounce the British Government as `useless" in Chinese.   

700149
The pro-sanctions Commonwealth leaders were hoping to persuade the banks to allow South Africa to negotiate the debt only one year at a time and to build political demands into the rescheduling plan. 
Joseph Hanlon, the co-ordinator of the Commonwealth <tag>sanctions</> study group, said last night: `South Africa will be exceedingly pleased.   

700150
Some Conservatives despised the League and wished to rely solely on the armed might of their own country. 
Mac- Donald's old associates of the U.D.C., on the other hand, deplored the reliance on <tag>sanctions</>, and hence on armed force, which the Protocol theoretically involved. 

700151
In practice, states from time to time see fit to interfere in the affairs of others in defence of dispossessed or repressed groups. 
The British Government, although it generally opposes the principle of <tag>sanctions</>, is not averse to applying diplomatic and political pressure to bring about internal reforms in, say, the Soviet bloc.   

700152
Then a few hours after Margaret Thatcher had signed that declaration, the British issued a separate statement, which they said had been agreed by the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary, John Major, although the two had not met over the weekend. 
This statement said the Commonwealth should concentrate on encouraging change rather than further punishment &dash. though in the majority declaration the Commonwealth said the purpose of sanctions was not to punish, but to apply pressure for change. 
The British statement said <tag>sanctions</> contributed to misery and poverty in South Africa and did not have the political effects claimed. 

700153
And he hoped the time would come when he and South Africa's president F.W. de Klerk would see the Prime Minister together. 
He said: `We did not see eye to eye on the question of <tag>sanctions</> and the use of violence as a political act."   

700154
They are the same demands that the African National Congress is making. 
Kuala Lumpur was supposed to be an easy summit where Commonwealth nations would agree to differ ideologically about the merits of <tag>sanctions</> and South Africa; no new sanctions would be added and none taken away.   

700155
It is also obvious that they will have to end long before South African society has reached a satisfactory condition, whether measured by democratic values, social justice or the redistribution of economic power. 
It seems to me, as a supporter of <tag>sanctions</> for the last 15 years, that this moment should come sooner rather than later, and now is the time for those with the future of a multi-racial South Africa at heart to say so.   

700156
Staff members of Beijing-run organisations in the territory who took part in pro-democracy rallies and signed petitions in support of the protests have been told that they will not be subjected to reprisals, although they have been warned that they should stay in line in the future. 
Reuter adds: China has condemned calls by the US Congress for further sanctions as interference in its internal affairs and a deliberate attempt to damage Sino-US relations. 
A protest note delivered to the US ambassador, Mr James Lilley, yesterday attacked congressional amendments by the House of Representatives and Senate on June 29 and July 14 urging more severe <tag>sanctions</>.   

700157
Sir: 
I agree with your leading article ('Do not <tag>sanction</> mental torture', 17 October) that the Soviet Union is `far from deserving readmission to the World Psychiatric Association" and that psychiatry there was `corrupted to a disgusting extent".   

700158
But these days everything in South African politics is about perceptions. 
America has shown it is possible to be against more <tag>sanctions</> and co-operate with the ANC and its anti-apartheid allies.   

700159
John Major, the Foreign Secretary, was drafted into the committee working on the conference report on South Africa, but his presence did not lead to an agreed text. 
He and other ministers had to cancel evening engagements as they wrangled throughout the day over the wording, but in the end they could only agree to record the wish of 47 countries for tougher <tag>sanctions</> against South Africa and the determination of Britain to encourage liberalism in Pretoria, not to punish it.   

700160
Amnesty is `encouraged", however, about the long term prospects. 
`Proposals have been made for major changes to existing laws that restrict freedom of expression, freedom of religion and freedom of assembly and movement." 
ON THE EVE of the Commonwealth Conference, ministers from the majority of member countries agreed not to press for new <tag>sanctions</> against South Africa, thus avoiding a 48-1 vote against Britain. 

700161
In March 1985 the Broads Grazing Marsh Conservation Scheme was launched. 
This scheme, which may just possibly prove to be a revolutionary approach to farming the landscape, is funded jointly by the Countryside Commission and the Ministry of Agriculture, and offers all landowners a flat fee of  #50 an acre (approximately one-third of what they would have obtained under the SSSI provisions of the Wildlife and Countryside Act) to retain low-gear livestock farming on the marshes. 
These arrangements have been fine-tuned by the designation of the Broads as an Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA), <tag>sanctioned</> by the Common Market.   

700162
They agreed to seek a meeting with Mr Kennbeth Baker, the Education Secretary, to ask for an extra #225 million to finance an interim pay award in hard-hit areas. 
The employers also agreed to ask the Government to <tag>sanction</> a substantial pay rise for next year to enable teaching to compete for recruits with other graduate professions.   

700163
The Trade and Industry Department was still in consultation with the 48 Group about their plans, he said. 
Later Mr David Howell (C. Guildford), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, attacked calls for economic <tag>sanctions</> against China, saying this `would put a dagger at the heart of Hong Kong".   

700164
SHARES in Euro Disneyland, the proposed theme park development near Paris, opened at a 26 per cent premium to the 707p offer price and maintained their high price as Japanese investors, who were prevented from subscribing for the issue, clamoured for shares. 
The shares opened at 890p, 183p above the issue price and 30p higher than their Friday trading price on the semi-official grey market <tag>sanctioned</> by the London and Paris stock exchanges. 

700165
At the same meeting Mr Cohen conceded that: `Sanctions have played a role in stimulating new thinking within the white power structure" &dash. a concession also made by the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Gerhardus De Kock, and the ruling National Party. 
In its manifesto for the September election, the NP declared: `Boycotts, sanctions and disinvestment have strained the economy of the country and every business and household." 
Mrs Thatcher is alone in not acknowledging the effect of <tag>sanctions</>. 

700166
Even after parliamentary reporting was recognised in the latter half of the eighteenth century, reporters were for many years tolerated only in the Strangers' Gallery. 
Press galleries were built in 1847 for the Lords and 1835 in the Commons, but only the London newspapers were <tag>sanctioned</>: the provincial press had to wait for admission until 1881.   

700167
The civil war which followed the treaty thus proved to be the most futile struggle in Ireland's tragic history ; Michael Collins and others had died in vain. 
Moreover, <tag>sanctions</>, far from being successful, had merely increased mutual hostility and had caused mutual impoverishment &dash. a lesson, totally ignored, which had its application in the wider field of international relations.   

700168
Although the television audience for Doug Mountjoy's victory over Stephen Hendry in last year's final peaked at 13.2 million, Tennent's discontinued its sponsorship in thinly veiled dissatisfaction with the WPBSA. 
When the WPBSA's quest for a replacement sponsor proved unavailing, its alternatives were to fund the event itself or to accept Hearn's terms. 
He will pay no <tag>sanction</> fee and will take the gate money.   

700169
By the end of the day, however, Mr Boesak had changed his line, ruling out a `honeymoon" for President de Klerk. 
Both Mr Mbeki and Mr Boesak agree that <tag>sanctions</> ought not to be lifted yet, though that is not on the agenda.   

700170
A bruising battle over the next two or three months looks guaranteed. 
THE Asian Development Bank, which halted new loans to China after a crackdown on unrest last June, will soon resume lending, a senior central bank official said yesterday. 
In an interview in the China Daily, Chen Yuan, vice-governor of the People's Bank of China said all foreign banks that `imposed <tag>sanctions</>" against Beijing at the time of Tiananmen Square massacre have shown signs of easing them.   

700171
But Norling is better known for his uncompromising attitude to foul play. 
He had the temerity to dismiss Jean-Pierre Garuet, the prop, in front of 55,000 baying Frenchmen in Paris &dash. one of 49 players on whom he has imposed the ultimate <tag>sanction</> in his 22 years of refereeing.   

700172
Yet, one of the catchwords that has been widely heard in Washington and elsewhere during the run up to the war has been the need to create a democratic environment in the Middle East after the war is over. 
That must also imply that Western politicians recognise the vital contribution that popular support and <tag>sanction</> would have for legitimising the new security proposals now on the table and thereby ensuring that they would be effective.   

700173
That Mr John Carlisle and his friends will never admit the truth is a poor reason for others to show the same stubborn fallibility. 
<tag>Sanctions</> and other pressures have triumphantly done their work, which was to force Pretoria into a process that would conclude with the end of minority rule. 

700174
She cited Italy's lifting of its investment ban &dash. which Britain did unilaterally shortly after Nelson Mandela's release in February &dash. as well as the resumption of Spanish cargo flights and Denmark's decision to send back its ambassador. 
As the heads of government flew home, some EC officials expressed the hope that if Mr Mandela's scheduled meeting with President De Klerk on July 10 goes well then the EC foreign ministers meeting on July 18 might be able to move towards lifting some voluntary <tag>sanctions</> as a group.   

700175
Inadvertently, she helped." 
This recognition has in no way tempered Sir Shridath's implacable conviction that <tag>sanctions</> remain the key to negotiations and to an honourable settlement in South Africa. 

700176
His thesis that the political coalition against Iraq has been assembled according to new precepts, and heralds the emergence of a new power structure, is entirely wrong. 
The actual conduct of the war demonstrates clearly that the UN <tag>sanction</> for the war is a fig leaf of Korean proportions, and that paper wraps stone is less accurate a metaphor than velvet wraps fist.   

700177
They envisaged a system in which the local authority had a power and a duty to try to secure that premises were not in a state which constituted a statutory nuisance. 
Action was initiated by the service of an abatement notice requiring remedial work; on the person in default failing to comply with the notice the local authority was obliged to make a complaint, which, if proved, resulted in a nuisance order requiring the defendant to get the work done. 
Effectively the sequence was that the person in default was told what was wrong and required to put it right; was given an opportunity to do so, and if he did not, was subject to court <tag>sanctions</>. 

700178
And neither, seemingly, as Oxford. 
Nelson Mandela has still reiterated the demand on behalf of the oppressed of South Africa that <tag>sanctions</> remain.   

700179
`Apartheid is still to be dismantled &dash. we want to maintain the pressure until apartheid is dead." 
Mr Harries was talking to the Press at Oxford Town Hall to discuss the changing political situation in South Africa in the wake of Nelson Mandela's release. 
His comments are in conflict with Mrs Thatcher's belief that <tag>sanctions</> should be scaled down to encourage Pretoria to carry out further reforms. 

700180
First, marriage as a legal institution developed, I submit, as an essential legal first step towards amassing wealth and power by uniting partners with these attributes and endowing with legitimacy their heirs so as to guarantee inheritance according to articulated and certain principles. 
In other words, doubts as to the proper division of property at death, as well as rights between living partners, were resolved by having legal rules prescribing a formula, but only applying within the context of a sanctioned, and thereby state-controlled, relationship. 
Side by side with such unions existed, and still exist, unions not <tag>sanctioned</> by law.   

700181
On January 18, 400,000 people demonstrated in Algiers. 
On January 25 Moroccan trade unions held a 24-hour strike in support of Iraq with official <tag>sanction</>, despite the riots that had taken place on the occasion of a previous strike last December.   

700182
It could either allow Fine Gael to form a government; go into coalition with Fine Gael; reach an agreement with the Progressive Democrats; or have another general election. 
He also promised that any agreement would have to be <tag>sanctioned</> by them and the party's national executive.   

700183
THE Canadian Prime Minister's rebuke was magisterial. 
`In Canada, you don't sign a statement at 5 o'clock and repudiate it at 6" said Brian Mulroney, apropos of the Thatcher/Major statement distancing Britain from the Commonwealth conference communique on <tag>sanctions</> issued earlier in Kuala Lumpur.   

700184
Diplomats pointed out from the moment of the arrest of Mr Bazoft and Mrs Parish last year their plight was difficult. 
Shocked and angry Euro-MPs today demanded the toughest Common Market <tag>sanctions</> against Iraq.  

700185
It should be possible to take breaches of agreements before the International Court of Justice or, when they amount to a threat to peace, before the Security Council. 
Obtaining compliance will be as difficult as it always has been, but an international community which has used <tag>sanctions</> to encourage change in southern Africa should be able to tackle the much more serious issues of enforcement associated with climate change and international security.   

700186
When a deal seems close, the world may have a covert hand in pressing for compromise all round. 
Likewise, the precipitate removal of every <tag>sanction</> at once would not be appropriate.   

700187
The election of FW de Klerk as president is a sign of progress, they say, and the imminent release of Walter Sisulu and the apparent movement towards negotiations are signs of a new atmosphere. 
Britain wants to encourage movement, not to stifle it, and any talk of <tag>sanctions</> would be bound to have a bad effect. 

700188
There is a temptation for such an association to become backward-looking and introspective. 
Thus the fact that Pakistan has decided to re-enter the fold has been greeted with considerable, perhaps disproportionate, enthusiasm, while the question of South Africa, which left the Commonwealth a quarter of a century ago, continues to preoccupy many of the remaining members of the club to an unhealthy degree &dash. although far less so than it did in Vancouver or in Nassau. 
Mrs Thatcher yesterday expressed yet again her view that any intensification of <tag>sanctions</> against South Africa would be `totally irresponsible" and, given the new administration and the new mood in Pretoria, her view proved far less contentious than it would have been a year ago.  

700189
Here is the realm of secrecy in social life, of purity and pollution, danger and security. 
It is central to every member of the society at the level of personal identity, as member of a social group, and of a whole culture that formulates and prescribes certain strict conceptions of rules and <tag>sanctions</> for sexual behavior and for the reproduction of society through its `proper" conduct.   

700190
The Court of Appeal granted leave so as to give effect to the probation officer's suggestion. 
In substituting the probation order the court was not taking a course which was regarded as more lenient, since effectively the <tag>sanctions</> of the suspended sentences remained. 

700191
The union leaders were now, for the most part, skilled negotiators, not agitators. 
They regarded a strike as the ultimate weapon, much like the <tag>sanctions</> which the League of Nations flourished and hoped never to use.   

700192
Thus Britain accepted a clause saying that the actions by the De Klerk government so far did not show that South Africa was prepared to dismantle `the pillars of apartheid" such as the Group Areas Act. 
Britain also agreed that this was not the time to consider any relaxation of existing sanctions and pressures, though throughout the conference British officials had argued South Africa should be rewarded for its moves towards liberalisation. 
Britain accepted that all current <tag>sanctions</> should stay in place and joined the call for the international community to maintain theirs. 

700193
There is no new cash infusion, although this is what South Africa's financial authorities desperately hope will happen in the future if they continue to pay up as required. 
Financial <tag>sanctions</> have hurt the South African economy far more than trade sanctions and disinvestment in recent years.  

700194
Mr Endara led an opposition alliance in elections in May which were annulled by General Noriega when it became clear that the opposition had won a commanding majority. 
Recognising the new government the US put in place, Mr Bush announced the immediate removal of economic <tag>sanctions</> imposed against Panama in an effort to topple the Noriega regime, whose removal has been a key US objective since he was indicted on drug trafficking charges in May 1988. 

700195
April 5 is the climax of Qingming, the annual grave-cleaning festival, when Chinese honour their dead. 
Today's regimented pageant on Tiananmen shows the authorities" determination that any public expression of grief at the monument this Qingming is officially <tag>sanctioned</> in honour of revolutionary martyrs and not of the several hundred or more who died in the massacre last June.   

700196
Many had increased their trade with South Africa, she said. 
And while they called for comprehensive <tag>sanctions</>, the Frontline states, at least, realised that if applied, they would do enormous damage to them as well as to the South African economy. 

700197
`If a political cadre is present at these meetings, arguing the government case, I sense the others are on my side." 
But many Chinese seem to hope that the West will not maintain economic <tag>sanctions</>. 

700198
Sir: 
I write in support of the sentiment in your leading article, `Do not <tag>sanction</> mental torture" (17 October), although from a different angle. 

700199
Therefore, this could hardly be regarded as a binding precedent. 
English law will permit quite severe injuries to be inflicted in the course of sport &dash. a fractured skull in a playground incident was <tag>sanctioned</> on this basis.   

700200
If it was victory, it was a Pyrrhic one. 
Commonwealth leaders were outraged that Britain &dash. hours after signing a joint statement agreeing that sanctions should stay until South Africa showed `clear and irreversible change" &dash. issued its own statement. 
This amplified its dissent from four clauses of the original text, and amounted to a rejection of what the other members accepted: essentially, that <tag>sanctions</> were desirable.  

700201
Paddock opinion agreed that it was ludicrous to imagine that Goodyear would be banned from international racing, a move that would destroy F1 at a stroke. 
Mercifully, Balestre subsequently retracted the ban on Goodyear, but emphasized that Cosworth and Ilmor would face serious <tag>sanctions</>.   

700202
In some specifics, the NP has already shown that its will to dismantle apartheid is still rather less formidable than the propaganda which claims that it is doing so. 
Moreover, as argued here after the Guardian's recent visit to South Africa, the blacks need confidence that the world continues to respect their struggle: respect which <tag>sanctions</> symbolise.   

700203
But that, maybe, is increasingly where Tory politicians of stature are to be found. 
Margaret Thatcher yesterday mounted a robust defence of her isolated stand on South Africa at the Commonwealth summit and dismissed reports that she had not consulted John Major, who was Foreign Secretary at the time, before issuing her objections to the agreed communique. 
In a statement to the Commons, the Prime Minister emphasised that the British declaration, opposing punitive <tag>sanctions</>, was the work of both herself and Mr Major.  

700204
It's six thirty two. 
Soviet Foreign Minister, Edoard Sheverdnaze says the United Nations could <tag>sanction</> military force if Iraq refuses to pull out of Kuwait.   

700205
The League was now in better shape for action. 
The organization of economic <tag>sanctions</> had been worked out in detail after the Manchurian affair.   

700206
Finally, concern has been expressed about adverse effects of the contingent fee on the judicial process itself. 
One is that it encourages excessive, unprofessional zeal in the conduct of the client's case to `win at all costs", from improper coaching of witnesses to groundless legal arguments designed to lead the court into error. 
But this impression must be balanced against the availability of judicial control and disciplinary <tag>sanctions</> for unethical tactics and the record of great effectiveness in legitimate trial advocacy in recent decades. 

700207
Do not be deluded into believing that the small changes we are seeing there are due to a sudden flowering of humanitarian feeling. 
Concern for the effect of sanctions on the blacks is misplaced. 
<tag>Sanctions</> must not only continue but must be escalated."   

700208
`Our legal advice at the moment is that Mr Clarke's actions are ultra vires," Professor Keen said. 
`We don't believe he has the legislative <tag>sanction</> to do what he is doing.   

700209
She refused to comment on the Midland position. 
The MMC recommendation on scrapping cardholder thresholds was the only one to be instantly <tag>sanctioned</> by Mr Ridley.   

700210
THE RESCHEDULING of a portion of South Africa's foreign debt last week will remove some of the uncertainty facing the country's financial authorities but will do little to lessen its economic woes. 
There was clearly no coincidence in the timing of the announcement by Dr Chris Stals, governor of South Africa's reserve bank, that its foreign creditor banks had agreed to reschedule the dollars 8bn ( #5bn) debt for a further three-and-a-half years beyond the current debt agreement which expires at the end of June next year. 
It came as the Commonwealth heads-of-government meeting in Kuala Lumpur was due to debate new <tag>sanctions</> against South Africa.   

700211
Several members of the European Parliament, including Mr Cot, had called for the pair to be suspended for five days with financial penalties. 
However, Mr Baron also ordered a review of the rules regarding disturbances in parliament sessions to ensure that tougher <tag>sanctions</> can be applied to members causing disruptions in future.   

700212
Gradually the aim was shifted, partly to satisfy the public demand for retaliation, partly from recognition that the precise targets were not being achieved. 
On 30 October 1940 the war cabinet agreed that `the civilian population around the target areas must be made to feel the weight of the war" . 
Six weeks later it <tag>sanctioned</> a `crash concentration" against a single German city.   

700213
This general duty of the doctor, to control symptoms as much as possible and otherwise make the patient as comfortable as possible, has implicit in it two propositions worth noticing. 
First, medical treatment other than symptom control or management is uncalled-for as a matter of law and, indeed, is inappropriate; not only is it unethical conduct, but the doctor could also be subject to legal <tag>sanction</>.   

700214
`If a political cadre is present at these meetings, arguing the government case, I sense the others are on my side." 
But many Chinese seem to hope that the West will not maintain economic sanctions. 
The Chinese manager of a foreign business concern, who sided with the protesters from the beginning, said: `The West should not cut us off with <tag>sanctions</>.   

700215
Consumer goods are normally used for instrumental reasons. 
Where the perfectionism advocated here goes beyond means-related paternalism is in <tag>sanctioning</> measures which encourage the adoption of valuable ends and discourage the pursuit of base ones.   

700216
He thought the punishment would reinforce the FA's determination to hold clubs collectively responsible for the actions of their players. 
Next season the <tag>sanctions</> would include points deductions. 

700217
Such a system, which will be discussed by ministers at a future meeting, could eliminate factors specific to the UK, such as the cost of mortgages, and thereby produce figures showing a narrower gap between British and EC inflation rates. 
This could be used by the Chancellor in his struggle with his cabinet allies to persuade Mrs Thatcher later this year that the time had come to bite the bullet on exchange rate mechanism membership. 
Apart from talks on economic and monetary union, there were some disagreements over the extent to which the EC should have authority to directly control the scale of national government budget deficits and be armed with powers of <tag>sanction</> against governments which broke EC guidelines.   

700218
In what it said was a gesture towards the `weak" and the `vulnerable", the Government decided that it was not necessary that anyone should have to be harassed, distressed, or alarmed; it was enough merely that one of these eventualities should be `likely" to happen. 
The White Paper had earlier dismissed such a proposal on the ground that it would give rise to `justifiable objections to a wide extension of the criminal law which might catch conduct not deserving of criminal <tag>sanctions</>" (Home Office, 1985b: 19).   

700219
The important question, however, is unlikely to be addressed in these celebrations. 
It is the question that should now be engaging British as well as American friends of Mandela and enemies of apartheid: When should <tag>sanctions</> end? 

700220
`We played the leading role in bringing Zimbabwe to independence and have given a great deal of help to Zimbabwe since independence," she said. 
`The neighbouring countries would be the first to suffer from more general sanctions against South Africa, and for very understandable reasons have not imposed them themselves." 
Mrs Thatcher said economic <tag>sanctions</> did have the effect of depressing an economy and depriving people of jobs, but rarely if ever had the desired political effect.   

700221
She also praised Mr Major for the `skilful manner" of his work on the final communique, crediting him with its recognition of change in South Africa. 
To the evident approval of many Tories, Mrs Thatcher warned African members of the Commonwealth that Britain would not provide aid to offset damage to their own economies if they imposed further sanctions. 
`Hardly was the ink dry" on the summit communique when she received a letter from one African leader saying the <tag>sanctions</> `the rest of them" had agreed would be very tough on his country.   

700222
It was argued that because the Secretary of State replied that gave the recipient an interest which he would not have had if no reply had been sent. 
If the court were to <tag>sanction</> that argument it might cause decision makers to be less helpful in their answers to the general public.   

700223
BRITISH Aerospace is expected to be asked today to comply with yesterday's European Commission ruling against Britain and return the #44.4 million `sweeteners" illegally allowed to it for its takeover of Rover Group. 
The Cabinet will this morning discuss the ruling by Sir Leon Brittan, the European competition commissioner, that ministers acted illegally in subsidising the #150 million takeover which Lord Young, the former Trade Secretary who <tag>sanctioned</> the deal, still calls `the deal of the decade".   

700225
The World Cup will increase their earning potential considerably," a rugby insider said. 
Australian authorities are considering trust funds as a deterrent to the financial allure of rugby league, and South Africa (one of eight IB members with the five European nations, Australia and New Zealand) has allegedly played fast and loose with the spirit of amateurism in encouraging players to defy <tag>sanctions</>.   

700226
Should the soya bean dispute erupt into a full-fledged trade war, it would prove much more costly than the conflict about hormones in beef. 
In January, America imposed <tag>sanctions</> which caused losses of $100million (#66.7million) in EC exports to protest against the Community's move on hormone-fed meat. 

700227
A survey of the site for the scheme revealed a small horse-grazed meadow  which was full of the flowers associated with permanent pasture. 
Since this  meadow was under possible threat and was not yet considered important enough  to be declared a Site of Special Scientific Interest, a small proportion of turf was dug up from the meadow, with the <tag>sanction</> of both the owner and the Nature  Conservancy Council, and was planted in the new flood-bank.   

700228
Mr Hurd told the meeting that the EC carried a heavy responsibility to ensure that, through inactivity, they were not partly responsible for the possible replacement of Mr De Klerk and his reforming government by a more rightwing administration. 
Among the governments now supporting the British plan for a progressive easing of sanctions is the Netherlands. 
The Dutch parliament last week passed a resolution urging the `step-by-step" approach which would lift <tag>sanctions</> as specific reforms were delivered by the South African government.   

700229
We don't seem to have any influence on American policy, and yet without us I think American policy would not appear credible in Europe. 
But if we look at what we now know to be the case &dash. which is that Saddam Hussein has an enormous war machine, that he was a tremendous threat in the region &dash. how, without going to war, and through the mere sustaining of <tag>sanctions</>, do you reduce that threat? 

700230
SOWETO &dash. Walter Sisulu, another of the freed leaders, said yesterday the ANC must pursue violence to bring pressure for government concessions that might lead to negotiations, AP reports. 
KUALA LUMPUR &dash. On the eve of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, the majority of members agreed not to press for additional <tag>sanctions</> against South Africa, but creditor banks would be expected to keep up the pressure on Pretoria, reports John Bulloch. 

700231
Washington Post. 
FOREIGN ministers from the 12 EC countries were last night divided on whether next week's Dublin summit should begin lifting economic sanctions against South Africa. 
A majority of EC governments now appear ready to send some signal to the South African government that the EC will lift <tag>sanctions</> in step with further progress in the release of political prisoners and the completion of the ending of the emergency laws.   

700232
If it was victory, it was a Pyrrhic one. 
Commonwealth leaders were outraged that Britain &dash. hours after signing a joint statement agreeing that <tag>sanctions</> should stay until South Africa showed `clear and irreversible change" &dash. issued its own statement. 

700233
`We want to be as reasonable as possible about this. 
A six-month breathing space would be in line with what most of us in South Africa have been saying," he said. 
Later, Thabo Mbeki, the external affairs secretary for the ANC, called on the Commonwealth to apply further <tag>sanctions</> against South Africa, suggesting sanctions on trade and a mandatory oil embargo.   

700234
For Marx, however, these political and religious implications were what was central. 
Evolutionary theory gave a natural origin to human institutions instead of the supernatural origin which was the received and legally <tag>sanctioned</> view in much of nineteenth-century Europe, and if institutions and ideas had a natural historical origin they could be changed in changing conditions.  

700235
Thus Britain accepted a clause saying that the actions by the De Klerk government so far did not show that South Africa was prepared to dismantle `the pillars of apartheid" such as the Group Areas Act. 
Britain also agreed that this was not the time to consider any relaxation of existing <tag>sanctions</> and pressures, though throughout the conference British officials had argued South Africa should be rewarded for its moves towards liberalisation.

While being led to the firing squad, Elena said only: `We want to die together, we do not want mercy." 
They were buried yesterday outside Bucharest. 
In another development, a provisional committee of free trade unions was officially <tag>sanctioned</> and spelled out its demands.   

700237
Critics among the fellow summit-nations see the US trade and budget deficits as the main cause of the international currency instability. 
US treasury officials, who will join President Bush's team in Paris, are expecting some sharp criticism of their attempt to cope with the trade deficit by using the draconian 301 provisions to threaten unilateral trade <tag>sanctions</> against Japan, India, and Brazil. 

700238
The problem, Mr Lipsky said, was that the US felt it had funded high technology developments in areas such as electronics, computers and aerospace, only to see the results stolen by piracy. 
Almost unanimously, he warned, people in the US industry supported the idea of trade <tag>sanctions</> against companies that did not protect and honour US patents in their respective countries.   

700239
Britain's Ministry of Defence was instrumental in blocking GEC's first attempt to merge with Plessey &dash. and in extracting concessions in return for allowing GEC, in partnership with Siemens of West Germany, to acquire Plessey at the second bite. 
It is one thing for a government to look benignly upon &dash. say &dash. a rescue of Ferranti; or on the swallowing up of much smaller players in the defence business. 
It would be quite another to imagine it <tag>sanctioning</> full-blooded mergers between the likes of BAe and GEC, which is what Professor Smith's script implies.  

700240
Most observers believe that China is convinced that only the West can provide the technology, markets, and investment it needs to modernise. 
Japan, Australia, Hong Kong and other key trading partners are reluctant to impose <tag>sanctions</>.   

700241
He criticises those against the war for the following reasons. 
First, there is no evidence whatever that Saddam could have been forced out; <tag>sanctions</> were simply not credible faced with such a despot.   

700242
Britain had played a positive role by supporting the Namibia settlement and by talking to South Africa rather than trying to ostracise it, she added. 
`We believe we have some results to show for our efforts and if anybody in South Africa, white or black, believes that opposition to <tag>sanctions</> represents support for the status quo, they are deluding themselves."   

700243
He beat down critics with the question: what is the alternative? 
Hardly anyone now believed that the League of Nations could be effective in its existing form, though many shrank from admitting it &dash. Germany, Italy, and Japan outside the League; <tag>sanctions</> shattered by the failure over Abyssinia.  

700244
He attended on his benefactor (for he made it very clear that he felt that I had done him a great service), who was put publicly on show as a social-symbolic guarantee that all was well. 
His position was thus <tag>sanctioned</> by the honored guest's authority.   

700245
I was delighted that the people of Britain gave him such a marvellous reception. 
I have no doubt that Nelson Mandela now knows the real voice of Britain is the one which he heard ringing out of Wembley, and not the one he hears calling from Number 10 for the letting up of <tag>sanctions</>.   

700246
She first became involved with CND in 1983 and was elected to its chair last year. 
Throughout the Gulf War, Thompson has advocated a peaceful solution through <tag>sanctions</>, negotiations and the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait.   

700247
Only a small minority correspond to the image. 
They may be willing to die for the motherland; conscription or the threat of <tag>sanctions</> may be required for everyone else.   

700248
As he looks back, Sir Shridath has concluded that `even the disagreements over South Africa helped the Commonwealth to develop a cohesion and an identity, transcending the old British connection." 
It would have been a different story if the white Commonwealth countries had all joined with Britain in opposing <tag>sanctions</>.   

700249
One life-saver needed by the new Peronist government of Carlos Menem is better trade relations with the European Community, which has refused to help Argentina while it remains technically at war with Britain. 
The Argentine Foreign Secretary, Domingo Cavallo, said: `We aim to normalise our ties with the UK in reciprocity so that the lifting of <tag>sanctions</> Argentina imposed on British companies can take place simultaneously with the lifting of other restrictions that Britains has imposed on Argentina."   

700250
But Mrs Thatcher will have some tense moments before then, on Thursday, when the talk turns to southern Africa. 
Britain hopes that the sanctions issue will not be raised at all, now that Walter Sisulu and seven other prominent black political prisoners have been freed by the FW de Klerk government, but it would be unwise to count on it. 
Many Commonwealth leaders are anxious to keep the pressure on South Africa, to make sure there is no backsliding, and they want this to be in the form of financial <tag>sanctions</>.  

700251
Clearly, the Hitler image, in this fundamentally important area, was again largely detached from reality. 
Though at the very beginning of his political `career", Hitler had emphasized the need for anti-Semitism derived from `reason", not pure `emotion", there were &dash. as is well known &dash. no measures in the `Jewish Question" which were too extreme for him, except on occasions where tactical considerations prevailed. 
His consistent defence of Streicher and Stu&umlaut.rner anti-Semitism, together with his <tag>sanctioning</> of the Goebbels initiative to unleash the November pogrom of 1938 &dash. to which he never publicly admitted &dash. demonstrate the extent of the gulf between image and reality. 

700252
No one at Geneva proposed to condemn Japan as an aggressor within the meaning of the Covenant. 
No one proposed to invoke Article XVI &dash. the <tag>sanctions</> article &dash. against her.   

700253
That may be true in general, but the other side of the coin is that Britain expects change in return, and puts on tremendous pressure to get that change," one official said. 
Commonwealth countries take the view that it is the limited <tag>sanctions</> so far applied which have done much to bring about the new climate represented by the de Klerk administration, and believe a turn of the screw would effect more change.   

700254
Some important planks of the policy have yet to be clarified, however. 
The party has not decided what would constitute a legitimate trade dispute under the law and precisely what forms of secondary action would be <tag>sanctioned</>.  

700255
When they spoke in the debate just before the war, Neil Kinnock and Gerald Kaufman said that a vote for the adjournment would not be a vote for war, that we believed that sanctions should be given longer. 
I listened to the BBC headlines the next morning, and they said, `Yesterday parliament gave overwhelming support to the government handling of the Gulf crisis." 
I believe that the opposition should have insisted on having a vote on a motion in which the government could have asked for support, and we would have put down an amendment saying that we thought that <tag>sanctions</> should have been given longer.   

700256
But as black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela arrived in Ottawa yesterday for talks with the Canadian government he again warned that easing international pressure on South Africa now, after only minimal reforms, would jeopardise the long struggle for equality by his country's black majority. 
In private talks he won the continued support of Canadian Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney, who later told parliament in Ottawa that <tag>sanctions</> should be maintained.   

700257
The liberal repute of the National government was restored. 
Collective security was in action at last. 
The aggressor was being resisted by `all <tag>sanctions</> short of war" or most of them, exactly as the voters in the Peace Ballot had demanded.   

700258
Contributory negligence has ever presented a challenge to juries' tolerance of a rule of law repugnant to the popular sense of fairness. 
That a negligent plaintiff should be barred from all recovery, particularly when he was much less to blame than the defendant, seemed a draconic and disproportionate <tag>sanction</> for carelessness. 

700259
For after conceding that the only relevant Code section, Section 1714, announced the basic rule of negligence coupled with a complete defence of contributory negligence,{fo id=75} the court discerned nevertheless a pervasive legislative intent that the codification of 1872 not impede further development of these cardinal concepts. 
From the specific Code instruction to construe provisions codifying existing statutes and common law as continuations thereof,{fo id=76} the court deduced authority for an ongoing judicial evolution of these provisions beyond the confines of the statutory language itself. 
Thus, in one fell swoop, it demolished both the argument that comparative fault was pre-empted by existing statute law and the argument that, in any event, the all-or-nothing rule was too interwoven in the very fabric of the law to be set aside without express legislative <tag>sanction</>.   

700260
Mrs Thatcher was unapologetic. 
Her speech, which at times seemed to be attacking the good faith of those advocating action against South Africa, meant Britain was once again on its own in calling for a halt to further <tag>sanctions</> against South Africa.   

700261
Because of the `unconvincing nature" of the compromise, he could not make up his mind whether he should apply for membership. 
Having failed to <tag>sanction</> expulsions, reformers were trying to drive out their opponents by personal insults, directed mostly at Karoly Grosz, the General Secretary, and Janos Berecz, the former conservative ideology chief.   

700262
Thus demand number one is a curb on criticism of the South African Government and apartheid. 
Pretoria also wants Mozambique to become a buffer against stepped-up sanctions. 
It might try to get the use of Maputo port for <tag>sanctions</> busting, and new economic links with Mozambique might be viewed as an excuse not to impose new sanctions.   

700263
THE LORD Chief Justice, Lord Lane, and the Master of the Rolls, Lord Donaldson, together urged the Government yesterday to build tougher safeguards into its plans to allow solicitors to appear in higher courts. 
The two senior serving judges of England and Wales demanded an explicit and over-riding `interest of justice" test for the removal of restrictive barriers, and the <tag>sanctioning</> of codes of conduct for new legal practitioners.   

700264
The move caused some surprise in Whitehall, where the belief is that it would be damaging to Mr de Klerk if he were seen to be making reformist moves because of external pressure. 
If he hoped to persuade Mrs Thatcher that the releases were a favour to her and should be rewarded by her support for lifting <tag>sanctions</>, he will be disappointed.

Mr Ramaphosa said that the prisoners' release should not be construed as an act of goodwill by Mr de Klerk, but as a reflection of the `dismal" failure of `the apartheid regime" to emasculate the will of the black majority. 
He warned Margaret Thatcher, as she prepares for a Commonwealth heads of government conference next week where the issue of <tag>sanctions</> on South Africa is expected to be central, against insisting that `the regime" was moving in the right direction.   

700266
When Iraq procrastinated after Iran announced its readiness to end the war, it was not felt to be the right time to attack Baghdad for its use of chemical weapons. 
Once the ceasefire was secured, however, there seemed less excuse for this reticence. 
And yet efforts to impose <tag>sanctions</> on Iraq failed in the face of resistance from governments.  

700267
They have chosen to exceed it by nearly #2m &dash. and no excuses can mitigate the effects. 
YOU state (Leader, Feb 21) that `Nelson Mandela asked for sanctions to continue". 
Chief Buthulezi doesn't believe in <tag>sanctions</>. 

700268
They are criticised as inadequate to separate serious and less heinous crimes, and as a spur to `distorted" convictions for manslaughter in cases &dash. mercy killings, for example &dash. with mitigating factors. 
Instead, they recommend fixed sentences and the imposition in open court of minimum term `penal sanctions" in which murderers are jailed for life. 
`The committee expect that their proposals will lead to very long penal <tag>sanctions</> in the most grave cases," the report says.   

700269
Mr Hore said `We have never had any quarrel with Esso &dash. they were doing their job getting a new site for a new filling station." 
`Our argument on this crazy decision has been with the Departments of Transport and Environment who <tag>sanctioned</> it."   

700270
Some 200 people have replied, and with at least 10 alleging they were involved in Repsol dealings without knowing. 
If these allegations are confirmed, not only would Drexel face heavy <tag>sanctions</> &dash. fines of up to five times the amount of the the profits obtained from the transaction or 5 per cent of their own funds is stipulated in the CNMV code &dash. as well as possible expulsion from the Spanish Stock Exchange, but also the threat of criminal action. 

700271
But the cost to Pretoria of destabilisation of Mozambique is so low, and the process so successful, that it may take more to convince South Africa to drop the MNR. 
Pretoria has already indicated three further demands: curbing anti-apartheid rhetoric, help in blocking international <tag>sanctions</>, and allowing economic penetration.   

700272
When work is being done by a small group of peers, control over the free-rider can usually be exerted by informal social controls, though even in these circumstances not always very effectively &dash. as members of university academic departments can sometimes testify! 
If an enterprise is large, however, some elements of formal organisation are even more likely to be necessary to meter individual effort and to <tag>sanction</> free-riding.   

700273
The snake is most dangerous, Zulu people say, when it senses it is going to die. 
THE United Nations has reached a consensus agreement on South Africa which drops demands for more <tag>sanctions</>, suggests existing sanctions might be lifted and calls for a negotiated end to apartheid.   

700275
It was one factor which allowed her to argue that the South African government was implementing reform and needed the carrot approach and not the stick. 
Anti-apartheid activists, both here and overseas, have targeted financial <tag>sanctions</> as the Achilles heel of the South African economy and have in recent months focused their efforts in pressuring the country's foreign creditors not to ease the debt burden unless Mr de Klerk's government moves away from repression and towards the abolition of apartheid.   

700276
But the Prime Minister still suspected he has been badly briefed and wanted to put him right about the murderous nature of the IRA. 
The two leaders also faced a head-on clash over South African <tag>sanctions</> and the best way to dismantle the apartheid regime.   

700277
Tornadoes devastated the American Mid West. 
First, Iraq has threatened to attack Israel and Saudia Arabia with missiles and bombs if war breaks out in the Gulf; the Iraqi News Agency said the warning had come from the country's Air Force Commander. 
In Washington President Bush said he would try to persuade other countries to help pay the cost of enforcing the United Nations <tag>sanctions</> aimed at making Iraq withdraw from Kuwait.  

700278
Some members of Congress were incensed by Mr Bush's overtures last weekend to Peking, calling it `kowtowing" and a `mockery of US concern for human rights". 
In making his decision, Mr Bush must weigh his desire not to disrupt `normal civilian commercial relations" with the Chinese, plus the need to avoid upsetting the Australian government &dash. which is America's main ally in the South Pacific &dash. against the possibility of an angry Congress imposing further <tag>sanctions</> against China.   

700279
The debt announcement pulled the rug from under the feet of pro-sanctions Commonwealth leaders who had intended to call on banks not to reschedule the loans, or at least impose harsh repayment terms. 
The release of the ANC leaders no doubt provided ammunition for Margaret Thatcher in her opposition to <tag>sanctions</>.   

700280
There are no plans for a direct meeting between Mr Hurd and his Syrian counterpart. 
Informed sources said they expected both Syria and Libya to protest at the <tag>sanctions</> imposed on them by Community members &dash. although there was still doubt over whether Libya would attend the meeting at all. 

700281
They include meetings between a government minister and exiles at an academic conference in Canada, and a visit by a senior Cuban diplomat to Miami, the heartland of the anti-Castro movement. 
`It would be a big mistake to write off the Cuban community in the United States as a monolithic group of hardliners who are servile tools of Washington in its confrontation with Cuba," Granma said in an unusually conciliatory gesture. 
It appears that President Castro, after years of failed attempts to loosen US <tag>sanctions</> through minor concessions to Washington on issues such as human rights, is now trying to woo less hardline exiles whose voices have frequently been drowned out by organisations such as the Cuban-American Foundation, a powerful lobby group which advocates Cuba's complete isolation.   

700282
The Labour leadership has taken a typically defensive position on the politics of the war. 
Its support for <tag>sanctions</> until war became inevitable limited the risks of internal disunity, without provoking accusations of disloyalty to British troops whose lives were at risk in the Gulf. 

700283
The court must be satisfied that all persons whose consent is required understand the legal effect of the adoption. 
It must also be satisfied that the adopter has not received nor agreed to receive, and that no person has made or given or agreed to make or give to the adopter, any payment in consideration of the adoption, except such as the court may <tag>sanction</>.   

700284
The talks, under the Structural Impediments Initiative, are to produce an interim report, due tomorrow, in which both sides state their plans to attack problems identified as the cause of the US deficit. 
A Japanese official said Japan's response to US complaints sprang not from threats of US retaliation, but deadlines, set by Congress, which could end in <tag>sanctions</>.  

700285
It doesn't do the name of boxing any good whatsoever, he's made twenty two comeback fights, he's won twenty-one inside the distance, but nobody is a name. 
I'm just not happy about it at all, the match should never have been <tag>sanctioned</>, and like I said, it does boxing's reputation no good whatsoever.   

700286
That came across very strongly at a UNEP conference in Nairobi in 1989 on phasing out CFCs. 
Buying out CFCs in the Third World is within the West's means, but buying out carbon dioxide in China, India, Brazil and the lesser parts of the Third World is certain to prove beyond anyone's means. 
If persuasion does not work, `green conditionality" might be the answer in some cases, unpopular though it would be; and for the really hard cases, <tag>sanctions</>, provided there is sufficient of a consensus to back them and the industrial world has not sunk into a mood of profound fatalism about the impossibility of stemming the greenhouse gases.   

700287
By 8.30pm, the Metropolitan Police said, officers had gone out on 350 emergency calls, including road crashes, heart attacks and maternity cases. 
Ambulance staff reported for duty yesterday, intending to enforce a series of <tag>sanctions</> drawn up by the unions as a protest over this year's pay offer, which the unions say is worth 6.5 per cent but which health service managers argue is worth at least 9.3 per cent for qualified London staff.   

700288
Those who insist on Mr Gorbachev achieving full democracy before he receives our aid can hardly seek to reward Mr De Klerk for doing less. 
But the argument now begins as to whether it is feasible to maintain <tag>sanctions</> to the last moment of a constitutional settlement, as the ANC still demands.   

700289
Nevertheless Zum has continued to gain support, mainly because it gives the government's growing number of critics a chance to demonstrate their opposition to Mr Mugabe, who has ruled the country since independence in 1980. 
ALL President FW de Klerk's talk of `a new South Africa", the expectation generated by the release of Walter Sisulu and the other political prisoners, the excitement about <tag>sanctions</> and negotiations and reform just pass by most black South Africans. 

700290
ALREADY under fire for its mission to Peking this month, the White House admitted yesterday that an earlier secret trip to China was made by Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, in July, barely a month after the massacre in Tiananmen Square. 
The White House admission, which followed a leak to CNN television news, seems bound to result in greater efforts from some members of Congress to increase economic <tag>sanctions</> against Peking when they return to Washington after Christmas.   

700291
First, I can make two points about the way in which the political constellation has changed since the beginning of August. 
At that time I was strongly in favour of <tag>sanctions</>, and I supported the dispatch of American troops to Saudi Arabia, according to Bush, to deter an attack on that country; though I would not myself have acceded to an American request to put British ground troops there, and I think many people in the Ministry of Defence argued strongly against that.   

700292
`I was charming," he said, `and told her I would have to sleep on it. 
I said that should you ever turn up alive you might not approve of the money having been spent on the things she deems essential and I am prepared to <tag>sanction</>.  

700293
One of the three-person delegation, Mr Azhar Cachalia, described the half-hour discussion as `cordial but frank, with no punches pulled." 
Both sides agreed that apartheid must go, said Mr Cachalia, but disagreed about the need for comprehensive mandatory sanctions. 
Although it is illegal to call for <tag>sanctions</> in South Africa, the delegation, both in Washington and at the Downing Street meeting, stressed their importance, especially financial sanctions, in helping to bring Pretoria to the negotiating table.   

700294
The government recognises it can only hope to prevent political unrest if it can deliver the jobs, education, houses and welfare services which black people demand. 
Financial <tag>sanctions</> are therefore among the most significant pressures for change here.   

700295
FERRARI yesterday decided to drop its appeals against the #32,000 fine and ban imposed on Nigel Mansell following his failure to stop after being disqualified from the Portuguese Grand Prix, writes Maurice Hamilton. 
The Portuguese authorities had promised to hear Ferrari's appeal against the fine next Wednesday, after which the FIA, the international automobile federation, was due to reach a decision on Ferrari's appeal over Mansell's ban from the Spanish Grand Prix which was staged on 1 October. 
Ferrari, while still convinced their arguments against the <tag>sanctions</> were valid, but mindful of the tradition they represent, said they wished to `remove any disturbing elements from Formula One racing" during the final two races of the season in Japan and Australia.  

700296
They agreed five years ago to let Thame Systems Ltd in Thame Park Road expand their computer-based industry. 
But they have now refused to <tag>sanction</> the renewal of the application.   

700297
In fact, the second objective of the US-led intervention in the crisis has turned out be the real concern. 
This was to establish the new pattern of global authority in the post-cold war world &dash. under the aegis of the United States, with or without the cloak of the United Nations <tag>sanction</>.  

700298
It also gave no hint of the extent of Asian Development Bank lending once it resumed. 
Western commercial banks have not imposed <tag>sanctions</> against China but they have generally backed away from new medium- and long-term credits, waiting to see whether credits from international lending institutions would be restored.   

700299
A cynic might add another argument for doing and saying nothing. 
It is that sanctions are not being observed anyway. 
France and Germany have ignored them for years, Asia has been quick to move in, and Africa itself has traded steadily with the Republic during the <tag>sanctions</> years. 

700300
The councils became predominantly instruments of national policy. 
About two-fifths of their income came from government grants (#107,828 in 1930 against receipts from rates of #156,312), and this in itself held them under central control without the need to invoke legal <tag>sanctions</>.

The International Stock Exchange is <tag>sanctioning</> the grey market in Euro Disneyland shares by displaying `when issued" prices.

Speaking before the dissenting British statement was issued, the outgoing Commonwealth Secretary-General, Sonny Ramphal, said he believed the communique on South Africa was stronger than ever before and showed greater unanimity than at previous meetings. 
In South Africa the Commonwealth statement on sanctions was criticised by the Foreign Minister, Pik Botha. 
`<tag>Sanctions</> can only further delay the negotiation process in South Africa," he said.   

700303
Nupe, the public employees' union, predicted that by Friday ambulance crews across Britain would have stepped-up the six-week campaign against the Government's demand that they accept a pay settlement lower than the rate of inflation. 
A four-point plan, agreed by all the unions, asks workers to: tighten their overtime ban to ensure that only 39 hours is worked each week; refuse to deal with paperwork which does not concern patients; stop taking `non-urgent" patients home from hospital; and reject orders to act as relief substitutes for senior officers. 
The 14-point list of <tag>sanctions</>, which London crews enforced from Monday morning until last night, will not be seen outside the capital.   

700304
These and other reports make it plain that attitudes were divided on the `Jewish Question", now as before. 
Whether positively, or &dash. in a minority of the population &dash. negatively, it seems plain that Hitler was now, to a far greater extent than in the pre-war period, directly associated with the radical anti Jewish actions of the regime. 
And for those, especially within the Movement, for whom it ranked as a burning issue, Hitler's words were clearly taken as a signal and <tag>sanction</> for further radical action and were increasingly treated as a literal description of what was actually taking place.  

700305
Loud calls for strict regulation followed, the result of which was a new Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) backed by tough regulatory powers, and a new independent management team at the stock exchange, which Mr Yuen now heads. 
Mr Yuen's remarks were triggered by proposed new insider trading legislation that calls for tougher <tag>sanctions</>, but stops short of criminalisation. 

700306
But the US administration was quick to make the best of the new policy and used it to indicate that Uncle Sam was serious about ending apartheid. 
In contrast, Mrs Thatcher said the new measures agreed at Nassau 1985 were a `teeny-weeny" concession on her part and has never concealed her contempt for <tag>sanctions</> since. 

700307
What is still required, however, is recognition of the `changed" sex by `officialdom". 
For it cannot be emphasized too much that the transsexual, even after conversion surgery, continually seeks reassurance that she is now accepted in her new sex role. 
It follows that this quest for reassurance will cause her to seek out situations in which some sort of official <tag>sanction</> will be given to her change.   

700308
This is to the good, as is the news that South Africa has reached agreement with international banks to reschedule dollars 8bn of short-term debt. 
South Africa's new president needs time, and it did the Commonwealth no good to have the Prime Minister of Great Britain sitting, as she has been, in splendid isolation on the <tag>sanctions</> issue. 

700309
The dismissal is puzzling because Pravda's vilification of Boris Yeltsin, the turbulent radical at odds with Moscow's establishment, would seem to suit Mr Gorbachev who, days earlier, had rebuked the editors of several other papers for their radicalism. 
Predictably, Margaret Thatcher was outnumbered 47 to one over further <tag>sanctions</> on South Africa, repeating her opposition to them to Commonwealth leaders in Kuala Lumpur.   

700310
Last Saturday, when the draft communique was agreed after 17 hours of argument, Mr Major was reported to have seen it as something of a personal triumph. 
He believed he had forced other countries to accept the view that <tag>sanctions</> should not be punitive, that they should be lifted if there were evidence of irreversible progress towards dismantling apartheid and that there had to be a peaceful resolution of the situation in South Africa.   

700311
The Foreign Office insisted that an essential part of his mission had been to persuade the Chinese that the Act was designed solely `to provide assurances to keep people in Hong Kong who are of crucial importance to maintain the stability and prosperity in the long run". 
While in China, Mr Maude promised British support for an early end to the economic <tag>sanctions</> imposed after last year's Tiananmen Square massacre.   

700312
The official British view was that the Commonwealth as a whole had realised that change was taking place in South Africa and did not want to do anything to make the new administration in Pretoria dig in its heels. 
But behind the smiles and handshakes, the first deal of the conference had been done: banks around the world would be expected to apply pressure. 
President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia said he would not ask for new <tag>sanctions</> but he did want to see financial pressure applied so that the momentum of change was maintained.   

700313
COMMONWEALTH foreign ministers were last night trying to set out a consensus view of what should be done to dismantle apartheid, but it was clear that they had been outmanoeuvred by F W de Klerk's government. 
A proposal by the Australian Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, to extend and intensify financial <tag>sanctions</> against Pretoria predictably set Margaret Thatcher against the 47 other Commonwealth heads of government.   

700314
They are criticised as inadequate to separate serious and less heinous crimes, and as a spur to `distorted" convictions for manslaughter in cases &dash. mercy killings, for example &dash. with mitigating factors. 
Instead, they recommend fixed sentences and the imposition in open court of minimum term `penal <tag>sanctions</>" in which murderers are jailed for life. 

700315
But they came near to it. 
Just as they had exaggerated the effect of economic <tag>sanctions</> against Italy, so they seemed to imagine that moral disapproval and economic boycott would bring down German fascism.   

700316
If the two-month-old party manages to win the parliamentary seat, it will be a message to Zanu that it must drastically rebuild its grassroots support before the national elections in 1990. 
The byelection is to elect a replacement for the late Maurice Nyagumbo, the top Zanu cabinet minister who committed suicide in April after his disgrace in the Willowgate inquiry, which said he had unscrupulously used influence to buy and sell cars. 
HUNGARY'S supreme court is to meet tomorrow to announce the judicial rehabilitation of the late prime minister, Imre Nagy, amid reports that the former leader, Mr Janos Kadar, who <tag>sanctioned</> Nagy's execution, is gravely ill in a Budapest hospital.   

700317
President Bush and his Secretary of State, Mr Jim Baker, have made it clear that their `measured response" against China was taken because the White House believes the long-term strategic importance of the relationship with China should outweigh any immediate reaction to the massacre in Tienanmen Square. 
But American businessmen now complain that the President's limited trade <tag>sanctions</> on military exports are having a far more sweeping impact than originally envisaged. 

700319
Egypt has joined in because of its dependence on United States aid and good will and because of its distaste for Iraq's bid for Arab leadership. 
Jordan has consistently opposed the military option, despite its reluctant support for <tag>sanctions</> against Iraq.   

700320
The disclosure of the trip earlier this month by Mr Scowcroft and the deputy secretary of state, Lawrence Eagleburger, brought cries of `kowtowing" to Peking from some Congressmen. 
President Bush's desire is to see the <tag>sanctions</> against Peking eased in order not to `isolate" China from the international community. 

700321
John Hendy QC, for Dr Higgs, told the court that despite the public furore surrounding the case, the appeal had turned on a narrow point of law. 
The court had to consider `the extent to which a health authority employer had the contractual right to impose a disciplinary <tag>sanction</> in respect of clinical conduct, on a consultant having full clinical autonomy, without observing the requirements of the ministerial disciplinary procedure which has operated for nearly 30 years".  

700322
However, in some respects Heath goes further than I do. 
Heath, I think, wrongly believed that it was possible as early as last autumn to negotiate the peaceful withdrawal of Saddam Hussein from the Gulf. 
I don't think that was true then, though it could have become so as Saddam Hussein faced continued <tag>sanctions</>.   

700323
The most notable feature of the law relating to liberty is the wide discretions reposed in officials &dash. discretions which are exercised according to `guidelines" issued by the Home Office or the Attorney General. 
These `guidelines" cover such important matters as the use of informers and secret surveillance devices, the criteria for collection of information on law-abiding citizens, the handling of pickets and demonstrators, the vetting of jurors, the use of CS gas and rubber bullets, and the treatment of immigrants. 
Such `guidelines" do not have the force of law and there is no <tag>sanction</> for disobedence.   

700324
Committees will study such issues as global warming, the role of technology, international economic and social systems, and the potential for `new and constructive relationships among industry, the economy, the society, and culture". 
People and organizations change, Bill Ruckelshaus points out, because they derive some benefit or because they incur <tag>sanctions</> for not doing so. 

700325
FOR the last 10 of his 15 years as Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Sir Shridath Ramphal's greatest antagonist has been Margaret Thatcher. 
The two have clashed repeatedly over the issue of South African <tag>sanctions</>.  

700326
However, the chief concessions have been made by the African National Congress, whose representatives came to New York to obtain a consensus rather than a majority statement on South Africa. 
They were told by the Foreign Office in London last weekend that the price of British support was the removal of key elements in the OAU document which endorsed the ANC's position and on which the UN document is based. 
Among these were: Removal of references to `comprehensive mandatory <tag>sanctions</>" &dash. replaced by `concerted and effective measures". 

700327
The strategy seemed to be beginning to work on South Africa. 
The world threatened Pretoria with <tag>sanctions</> while Margaret Thatcher played the saviour: `Look at what I am saving you from, now do what I say".   

700328
He failed, however, to get the rapturous reception he may have expected from his chief apologist on the international scene. 
Rumours that Britain would ask for anti-apartheid <tag>sanctions</> to be relaxed were quashed, although the Prime Minister offered some encouragement by calling the release `a major step in the right direction". 

700329
This may involve interference with otherwise lawful conduct. 
The threat of criminal <tag>sanction</> hangs over those who refute the constable's perception of events.   

700330
Speaking before the dissenting British statement was issued, the outgoing Commonwealth Secretary-General, Sonny Ramphal, said he believed the communique on South Africa was stronger than ever before and showed greater unanimity than at previous meetings. 
In South Africa the Commonwealth statement on <tag>sanctions</> was criticised by the Foreign Minister, Pik Botha. 

700331
People had to live with the consequences of what they put their hand to, Mrs Thatcher said. 
Mr Kinnock said the Prime Minister had put her signature to a Commonwealth agreement which said all existing sanctions should be maintained. 
How could she reconcile that with her statement saying the effect of those same <tag>sanctions</> was to increase resistance to change? 

700332
Earlier, in Washington Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said conditions for full normalisation with Peking were not yet right. 
Outraged by the killing of unarmed civilians, Washington took the lead in imposing <tag>sanctions</> on China in June, banning all high-level contacts, military co-operation and government loans. 

700333
These were not much more than rationalizations. 
The government, and the British people, had said: all sanctions short of war. 
Therefore any <tag>sanctions</> which raised the shadow of war were automatically ruled out.   

700334
At the same time, it was accepted that all the talks, petitions, donations and arguments had been brought about by the imminence of the Commonwealth Conference, where the Secretary-General, Sonny Ramphal, has warned that Britain may find itself in a minority of one over South Africa. 
Mrs Thatcher has made it clear that Britain remains as adamantly opposed as ever to sanctions and has no intention of joining in new measures against South Africa. 
The latest argument deployed in Whitehall yesterday was not only that <tag>sanctions</> hurt the worst-off sections of the South African community &dash. the ones they are designed to help &dash. but that financial measures against South Africa might induce the country to default on its international commitments.   

700335
ABOUT 3,750 jobs will be created in the depressed North-east following the award of a #200m contract to redevelop the Albert Edward Dock, Tyneside. 
The redevelopment, <tag>sanctioned</> by the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation, will be carried out by a consortium which includes Cussins Property Group, Throgmorton Trust, Balfour Beatty, London &and. Edinburgh Trust and Bellway.   

700336
The UN is due to hold its annual debate on Cambodia in two weeks time, when a majority of members is expected again to support the guerrilla coalition that includes the Khmer Rouge. 
CANBERRA (Reuter) &dash. The Australian Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, renewed his criticism of Margaret Thatcher for her behaviour at last month's meeting of Commonwealth leaders in Malaysia when she issued a statement critical of a joint declaration on <tag>sanctions</> which she had signed.   

700337
`Fund-holding GPs and their patients will be able to decide which hospitals they wish to use, and to finance those hospitals direct for the services covered by the scheme." 
Key changes from the original proposals mean the budgets will be reviewed annually, rather than every three years; practices will be able to ask for increases during the year; GPs will be `expected" to stay within budget, but overspends of up to 5 per cent will not have to be clawed back from the next year's expenditure. 
Those who overspend without good cause will be expected to propose action to ensure it does not happen again &dash. with the main <tag>sanction</> for unjustified overspending being removal of the right to hold a budget. 

700338
Shareholders are not similarly taxed by companies." 
Parliament never intended that ratepayers should be made liable for an activity which it had never <tag>sanctioned</> in the first place.   

700339
People everywhere are concerned about starvation in Ethiopia and apartheid in South Africa, but the fate of the Armenian people, who have been brought to the brink of destruction, is considered by the West as the Soviet Union's internal affair. 
`All power to the Soviets" but our president has taken away from the Moscow Soviet, and indirectly from 10 million Muscovites, their right to <tag>sanction</> public meetings in central Moscow.   

700340
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe called the British action `despicable and unacceptable" while Geoffrey Palmer of New Zealand said it would have been better for the Commonwealth if Mrs Thatcher had not acted as she did. 
While the official conference communique called for increased financial <tag>sanctions</> against South Africa to make it dismantle apartheid, Britain wanted to remove sanctions as a reward for steps toward liberalisation. 

700341
Outside but shadowing the DM, we deny ourselves the support of the system at times of currency fluctuation. 
We could accept a lower parity as part of a decision to join because it would be coupled with the disciplines of the exchange rate mechanism." 
Otherwise, he argued, to devalue would be to <tag>sanction</> the inflationary wage-increases which had vitiated so much of Britain's post-war economic history. 

700342
MADRID (Reuter) &dash. The National Securities Market Commission, Spain's watchdog, has recommended that the Spanish branch of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the US brokerage house, be fined 65m pesetas ( #362,000) for alleged irregularities in the partial privatisation of Repsol, the state oil group, last May. 
The commission said in a statement that it had agreed this week to propose the <tag>sanction</> &dash. five times the gross profits obtained from Drexel's intervention in the sale &dash. to the economy ministry.   

700343
Mr Hawke and other leaders did not accept the argument. 
`We are not trying to bring South Africa to its knees, but to the negotiating table," he said, and quoted South African ministers and officials to show that <tag>sanctions</> were having an effect.   

700344
With only three weeks of the present session of Parliament remaining, their object is to try and squeeze out the Associated British Ports Bill. 
The Children Bill includes reform of the law in the wake of the Cleveland child abuse crisis and enjoys all-party support. 
JOHN MAJOR, the Foreign Secretary, faced Opposition ridicule and scorn in the Commons yesterday as he attempted to justify the behaviour of the Prime Minister over the issue of <tag>sanctions</> against South Africa at the Commonwealth summit.   

700345
Nozick does not regard the prohibition as being as absolute and exceptionless as one would expect if it is to be an interpretation of the Kantian imperative. 
He allows for imposing sacrifices on people, even if there are no counterbalancing benefits for them (even though they are separate people and their lives are the only lives they have) in cases of self-defence. 
Moreover, Nozick goes a long way beyond self-defence by <tag>sanctioning</> the use of force by an organization not created by consent, if it could have been created by consent through the Invisible Hand mechanism.   

700346
Many had increased their trade with South Africa, she said. 
And while they called for comprehensive sanctions, the Frontline states, at least, realised that if applied, they would do enormous damage to them as well as to the South African economy. 
Quoting polls which showed two out of three black South Africans did not want <tag>sanctions</> if they cost jobs there, Mrs Thatcher said she was in step with the people in South Africa, and in practice the Commonwealth was in step with her.   

700347

Michelet's prescription for curing this disease of an improperly stimulated female sexual organ was the classic advice, <tag>sanctioned</> by centuries of patriarchal control over women's bodies: marry, get pregnant, have children.

He disliked pretence and uncertainty. 
He had been the first minister to advocate the abandonment of <tag>sanctions</> against Italy, when they had obviously failed, just as he had been the most rigorous in pressing Edward VIII.   

700349
The anti-sanctions cause has been carried for so long by so many racists, profiteers and other species of moral gangster that there is a strong temptation to withhold support from anything they defend. 
For years the anti-<tag>sanctions</> brigade has been dominated by pro-apartheid battalions, who continue even to lack the grace or intellectual honesty (unlike a fair number of South African ministers and officials) to admit that the amazing events of the last six months are the result, in large part, of the pressure sanctions epitomise.   

700350
Wherever the Cup goes, the British should still control it," he said. 
Jacklin, who was launching a video of the 14-14 tie at The Belfry in September, said after he bowed out as captain, he wrote to Lord Derby, president of the PGA, imploring him not to <tag>sanction</> any alteration to the format of the Cup.   

700351
The essence of any social policy was its ability to create employment and the government had ably demonstrated its success in this area. 
Labour MPs contended Britain was now completely isolated in three major foreign policy areas: South African <tag>sanctions</>, the modernisation of nuclear weapons in Europe and European employment practice.   

700352
Nozick does not regard the prohibition as being as absolute and exceptionless as one would expect if it is to be an interpretation of the Kantian imperative. 
He allows for imposing sacrifices on people, even if there are no counterbalancing benefits for them (even though they are separate people and their lives are the only lives they have) in cases of self-defence. 
Moreover, Nozick goes a long way beyond self-defence by <tag>sanctioning</> the use of force by an organization not created by consent, if it could have been created by consent through the Invisible Hand mechanism.   

700353
Moreover, so long as Russia remains united to Byelorussia and the Ukraine, it will always militarily be the most powerful state in Europe. 
Whether reunification will quickly be <tag>sanctioned</> by the Kremlin will, however, partly depend on the Soviet domestic crisis and the effects this will have on the men who rule the USSR. 

700354
Now more would have to be done against Italy, or a way out would have to be found. 
It was generally held that stopping oil supplies to Italy &dash. the `oil <tag>sanction</>" &dash. would do the trick.   

700355
Americans admit that they have spent vast sums of money to help the Contras wage war against the government and the people who supported it. 
In addition, they also applied severe economic <tag>sanctions</> against Nicaragua. 

700356
But just saying that is a waste of time. 
There has to be a <tag>sanction</>, a punishment, to deter the strong from killing the weak, or, indeed, taking their goods, or abusing their womenfolk or their children.   

700357
There will be strong pressure from some of his committee for family doctors to be asked whether they are prepared to submit undated resignations to the NHS in a last attempt to get Mr Clarke back to the negotiating table. 
A working party on <tag>sanctions</> is due to report.   

700358
That is to say, those who tend to make up the bulk of their followers or attendants, who go to the rituals, and sit in their reception rooms are very often the unmarried (or only recently married) young men. 
My suggestion is, and it is only speculative, that the sheikhs were, and in our case still are, often most important for providing a moral and ritual framework and <tag>sanction</> for a group that for many different reasons is central to the problems and ambiguities of sexuality and honor in such societies.   

700359
Everything will be infinitely worse. 
Your scenario before the war then was: <tag>sanctions</>, leading to a position where sooner or later you could negotiate the issues involved.   

700360
That at least keeps American options open. 
At the same meeting Mr Cohen conceded that: `<tag>Sanctions</> have played a role in stimulating new thinking within the white power structure" &dash. a concession also made by the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Gerhardus De Kock, and the ruling National Party. 

700361
He described their talks at 10 Downing Street as cordial. 
They differed in their attitudes to economic <tag>sanctions</> against Pretoria and use of violence by the ANC, but found common ground in Mrs Thatcher's opposition to apartheid, he said.   

700362
But such cynicism is not equal to the point it needs to meet. 
For the truth is that none of these breaches overshadows the effect of the continuing <tag>sanction</> deriving from the US Congress and enacted by, among others, the US banks.   

700363
The action has been taken because the members allege that Lloyd's had been in breach of contract, duty and good faith and that it withheld the facts gathered by the market's authorities following an internal investigation during 1980 and 1981 into alleged accounting irregularities at Oakeley Vaughan. 
Lloyd's is contesting the action but as part of the campaign the Oakeley Vaughan members, through their lawyers Elborne Mitchell, have gained access to 1,500 documents, including a confidential report by Lloyd's which investigated the alleged irregularities at the agency. 
EUROPE and the US are heading for a row over <tag>sanctions</> on technology imports into the United States.  

700364
`The aim of matching the number of training jobs to the consultant posts available is sound, but how that is to be done needs to be reassessed." 
Kenneth Clarke, Secretary of State for Health, urged family doctors' leaders not to introduce <tag>sanctions</> over their new contract when they meet today.   

700365
No answer was found. 
The oil <tag>sanction</> was repeatedly proposed and as repeatedly put off when Mussolini objected to it.   

700366
If the police have still not got what they want, there is a final option open to them. 
Before the seventy-two hours are up, they can go back to the court and apply for an extension of the warrant of further detention by up to another thirty-six hours. 
The criteria are the same as before, so the desire to pursue still further the questioning of the suspect may be enough to justify the court's <tag>sanction</> for this additional detention.  

700367
KENNETH CLARKE, the Secretary of State for Health, yesterday announced moves to enfranchise the non-TUC ambulance union in pay negotiations, as the dispute worsened across the country. 
He is expected to <tag>sanction</> a parallel negotiating body, running alongside the Whitley Council representing TUC unions in the dispute over pay. 

700368
The really new work in the concert, a Fantasia for harp commissioned by Sioned Williams from John Marson, was not, to the non-specialist ear, very arresting. 
Harpists listening to the broadcast on Radio 3 will surely have appreciated the idiomatic writing and voluptuous harmonies, however, just as they must have been fascinated by the experiment of performing Schubert's Harper Songs with harp rather than piano &dash. an alternative <tag>sanctioned</> by the composer but suggesting in performance that his accompaniment is more successful at imitating a harp through the piano than actually being one.   

700369
In not taking this step seven years or five years ago, this country could have been saved a great deal of suffering. 
But the government front bench denied opposition claims that they'd deliberately delayed the decision to boost Tory support on the eve of the Party Conference. 
And IRN's top story at six again &dash. an Iraqi <tag>sanctions</> busting ship boarded by Royal Marines in the Gulf, has now been seized by the multi-national task force. 

700370
At the same time, it was accepted that all the talks, petitions, donations and arguments had been brought about by the imminence of the Commonwealth Conference, where the Secretary-General, Sonny Ramphal, has warned that Britain may find itself in a minority of one over South Africa. 
Mrs Thatcher has made it clear that Britain remains as adamantly opposed as ever to <tag>sanctions</> and has no intention of joining in new measures against South Africa. 

700371
BRITAIN last night sought to justify its conduct in issuing a separate statement immediately after the Commonwealth conference had put out its own communique on South Africa, and claimed that despite the 48-to-one decisions at the Kuala Lumpur meeting, it was Britain that had come out on top. 
The Commonwealth statement said Britain and the 48 other Commonwealth nations agreed <tag>sanctions</> against South Africa should stay in place until there was `clear and irreversible change".   

700372
All these do actually mediate between the political and economic foundations and the everyday world of men's experience. 
But the practice of control is known, clear, personal, direct, as are the <tag>sanctions</> that can be brought into play.   

700373
According to an observer in Silesia, the speech focused the general discussion of the population, even in Nazi circles, almost exclusively upon the coming war. 
But again, there was no mention of the passage on the Jews. 
The lengthy section in the same report on the persecution of the Jews in Germany began by stating that what was currently taking place was the `irresistible extermination of a minority", comparable to the genocide against the Armenians by the Turks during the First World War but carried out in Germany against the Jews `more slowly and in more planned fashion", adding accurately that `in reality a lawless situation has long prevailed, through which every act of force against the Jewish minority is <tag>sanctioned</>". 

700374
The second entitles lawyers who have been instrumental in the creation or preservation of a fund for a group of beneficiaries to reward themselves for their services out of that fund. 
This theory, which offended the laissez-faire underpinning of the American rule no more than do the ubiquitous fee clauses in contracts, was <tag>sanctioned</> as early as the 1880s. 

700375
She also seems, again, to be at odds with her Foreign Secretary by adding her own controversial gloss to what he had carefully worked out as the agreed Commonwealth position at the weekend. 
American <tag>sanctions</> against South Africa are not very much more effective than those `measures" applied by Britain.   

700376
Announcing the change, Tony Creber, the headmaster said that the experimental policy reflected changes in education policy. 
He said: `It is important that problems are solved by discussions between the teacher and the pupil concerned, and not by impersonal, arbitrary <tag>sanctions</>."   

700377
The following is an edited version of his remarks: Perestroika continues experiencing strong resistance from dogmatic, conservative forces, many of whom view the democratic steps as deviation from Socialist principles. 
There appears the wish to move towards solving present-day problems by means of force, to bring back the authority they are losing by applying <tag>sanctions</> to all who disagree or who are criticising.   

700378
And if other parties will not give in, then, perhaps, the electorate will. 
The other uncertainty is whether or not President Patrick Hillery will <tag>sanction</> another election.   

700379
No Government, no business, could conceive of moving at such a medieval speed. 
Yet the law evidently can, and with no <tag>sanction</> upon it.   

700380
Mr Kissinger was in China early last month, and reported on his conversations with Deng Xiaoping to President Bush and Mr Scowcroft. 
He told The Washington Post he made some recommendations about <tag>sanctions</> against Peking, but would not say what they were.   

700381
Mr McLaren pointed out that this was fewer than the 270 who arrived during the two days the UN meeting was in progress. 
Britain and Hong Kong are supported by other South-East Asian countries of first asylum such as Malaysia and Thailand. 
The United States remains adamantly opposed to forced repatriation, but other countries, previously unhappy about deportations, have been seeking a compromise which could bring relief to the colony, including setting a time limit for voluntary repatriation, after which mandatory return might be <tag>sanctioned</>.   

700382
Then a few hours after Margaret Thatcher had signed that declaration, the British issued a separate statement, which they said had been agreed by the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary, John Major, although the two had not met over the weekend. 
This statement said the Commonwealth should concentrate on encouraging change rather than further punishment &dash. though in the majority declaration the Commonwealth said the purpose of <tag>sanctions</> was not to punish, but to apply pressure for change. 

700383
Liability thereby serves both to correct the injustice to the victim and as a warning to others. 
There may be other auxiliary <tag>sanctions</> against unacceptable conduct, but experience shows that none equals tort liability in its effectiveness.   

700384
The 1990 Guardian Research Fellowship to Nuffield College has been awarded to Roger Omond, chief sub-editor in the Guardian's foreign department. 
Mr Omond is the author of the Apartheid Handbook, the <tag>Sanctions</> Handbook (with Joe Hanlon) and Steve Biko and Apartheid.   

700385
The incident erupted after a protest in the camp by some 300 inmates against the government's forced repatriation policy. 
PARIS (Reuter) &dash. Four Arab states asked the EC to lift <tag>sanctions</> imposed on Libya and Syria in 1986 and France said the EC would review the measures. 

700386
Many interpret Malawi's uncomplaining acceptance of the refugee burden as an attempt to ingratiate itself with its neighbours. 
The six Frontline states have repeatedly criticised the Banda government for refusing to back <tag>sanctions</> against South Africa.

It was made inside a secure unit and follows the daily life of the girls and staff. 
Young runaways often end up in secure accommodation `for their own protection" and live for some months under lock and key &dash. the ultimate <tag>sanction</> of our child care system.  

700388
Patients who do not go now because they worry about the cost would be told in writing beforehand what was to be done, with an estimate of the cost, he added. 
KENNETH CLARKE, the Secretary of State for Health, is formally to impose his new contract on Britain's 35,000 family doctors today, amid threats of resignation by some and calls for <tag>sanctions</> by others, writes Nicholas Timmins.   

700389
Indeed, if Great Britain had been fighting the war alone, she would have come out with her international financial position slightly stronger than when she had gone in. 
This rosy picture was changed by the lavish loans which Great Britain distributed to her allies &dash. oddly, without any parliamentary <tag>sanction</>.   

700390
Some students also challenged the legitimacy of two student leaders who were reading the approved questions. 
Last May, when independent student organisations were formed to challenge the officially <tag>sanctioned</> student unions, students had voted the two out of office.   

700391
But Mrs Thatcher will have some tense moments before then, on Thursday, when the talk turns to southern Africa. 
Britain hopes that the <tag>sanctions</> issue will not be raised at all, now that Walter Sisulu and seven other prominent black political prisoners have been freed by the FW de Klerk government, but it would be unwise to count on it. 

700392
This is quite an argument against thinking that you can dispose of Saddam Hussein by bombing his country back into the stone age, isn't it? 
But your difficulty, sure, is that even if <tag>sanctions</> had worked for a year or even two years, you would still be left with that formidable monster of a regime &ellip   

700393
Nonetheless, China is the nub. 
Japan told the Houston summit that it was breaking ranks with the post-Tiananmen <tag>sanctions</> and extending credit to China again.   

700394
Besides, fierce competition at the bar means that litigants are more likely to find a champion even beyond the point where the chance of success becomes so unreasonable that it would no longer be in the public interest to encourage litigation. 
Complaints about abusive practices have led to some measure of regulation. 
In general, voluntary action by the professional bodies has been unproductive, if only because in most states they lack any effective <tag>sanction</>, membership being voluntary.   

700395
In the zikr men experience a concentrated power. 
They call out and chant the Names of God, thrust backward and forward in violent rhythmical movements, give themselves up to forces that seem to come from outside, from the word of the Divinity that reaches down into their nerves, their breathing, their innermost physical and emotional natures. 
Each man is free to construct his own vivid moment of truth through whirling around, leaping up and down, gasping the Names of God, without any official to reprimand him or any <tag>sanctions</> on his behavior that would in Cairo be so frowned on and so immediately checked.   

700396
Bush then used the resolution to bludgeon the US Congress into approving his war. 
Moreover, many of the international deals that made US military action possible in the Gulf, were conceived of, or concluded during the UN World Summit for Children in September 1990. 
While never publicly stated, it was understood that China's abstention  during the vote on UNSCR 678 (Yemen and Cuba voted no) won it a reprieve from the enforcement of US <tag>sanctions</> linked to its slaughter of students in Tiananmen Square in 1989.  

700397
That is, a surface of molten rock, and a thick, choking atmospheric of biting clouds of sulphuric acid. 
SANCTIONS against South Africa should be maintained until apartheid is dismantled, says the Bishop of Oxford, the Rt Rev Richard Harries. 
Speaking in Oxford today, he said: `I think most people realise that now is not the time to ease up on <tag>sanctions</>."  

700398
In all such cases the rule would seem to apply that the infant's acts are `voidable"; they become binding on him only if, after attaining full age, he fails within a reasonable time to repudiate them. 
The rule has been relaxed so as to enable infants to make a binding settlement of their property upon marriage, but only with the <tag>sanction</> of the court.   

700399
What is more, all too many automobile owners fail to procure higher cover despite their exposure to liability in six and seven figures. 
What <tag>sanctions</> are there against an insurer turning down a settlement offer by the plaintiff within the insurance limits and thereby exposing his client, the insured, to personal liability on a later verdict in excess of those limits? 

700400
The growing barbarization of the war, especially following the invasion ofthe Soviet Union, led to an increasing dehumanization of the abstract image of the `Jew" and a corresponding `internalization" of the justification of the need to search for a radical solution to the `Jewish Question". 
As the forthright proponent of the `destruction of European Jewry", Hitler's image was enhanced among a minority &dash.  though a growing and powerful minority &dash. of the German population (especially, though by no means exclusively, those `organized" in the Nazi Movement and, presumably, those who already before the war had been active, whole-hearted Nazis and convinced ideological anti-Semites) by his open association with extreme anti-Jewish measures. 
For the committed exponents of Nazi rule, Hitler's public statements on the destruction of the Jews provided <tag>sanction</> and legitimation for their own `private initiatives" taken against Jews, backing and support for their own involvement in the escalating criminality of the regime.   

700401
She also praised Mr Major for the `skilful manner" of his work on the final communique, crediting him with its recognition of change in South Africa. 
To the evident approval of many Tories, Mrs Thatcher warned African members of the Commonwealth that Britain would not provide aid to offset damage to their own economies if they imposed further <tag>sanctions</>. 

700402
Yet the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which China applied to rejoin in 1986, postponed a meeting that was to have occurred in Geneva to discuss terms. 
The group's official explanation: This is not due to <tag>sanctions</>, but to the difficulty of a `practical and meaningful discussion" &ellip   

700403
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe called the British action `despicable and unacceptable" while Geoffrey Palmer of New Zealand said it would have been better for the Commonwealth if Mrs Thatcher had not acted as she did. 
While the official conference communique called for increased financial sanctions against South Africa to make it dismantle apartheid, Britain wanted to remove sanctions as a reward for steps toward liberalisation. 
Britain dissented from four sections of the communique and though it accepted that existing <tag>sanctions</> should remain, said it wanted no new ones. 

700404
Quite apart from his meetings with government ministers, he has written to the Zulu chief, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, whose organisation, Inkatha, is detested by the MDM. 
Not only does Inkatha reject international <tag>sanctions</> and the `armed struggle" (two pillars of MDM-ANC faith), not only does Chief Buthelezi, besides, maintain cordial relations with the government, but also, Inkatha has been at war in Natal province with MDM loyalists since 1985.  

700406
Although Denmark joined Ireland in opposing any immediate lifting of the sanctions on new investment and on trade in gold bullion, iron and steel, there was general support for reconsidering the resumption of sporting links with South Africa if the improvement in the political situation there continued. 
Mr Hurd told the meeting that the EC carried a heavy responsibility to ensure that, through inactivity, they were not partly responsible for the possible replacement of Mr De Klerk and his reforming government by a more rightwing administration. 
Among the governments now supporting the British plan for a progressive easing of <tag>sanctions</> is the Netherlands. 

700407
I am in step with the people of South Africa. 
Margaret Thatcher on her stance over <tag>sanctions</>.   

700408
BRITAIN made few friends and many enemies this week. 
The Commonwealth conference in Kuala Lumpur ended in acrimony, with Margaret Thatcher claiming `victory" on <tag>sanctions</> against South Africa, despite being outnumbered 48 to 1.   

700409
He said yesterday: `We have the authority to call the club before us and to make them account for the manner in which their playing affairs are being conducted. 
The ultimate <tag>sanction</> is a club ban." 

700410
Unexceptional though the proposals are, their widespread endorsement could have two unwelcome effects for Mr de Klerk: of internationalising negotiations for reform, and of marginalising other potentially important representatives of the black majority, like the Zulu leader Chief Buthelezi. 
For Mrs Thatcher, the timing of President de Klerk's announcement in the week before the Commonwealth conference is helpful, though she would have had no difficulty in resisting pressure there for further <tag>sanctions</>.   

700411
THE European Community last night agreed to a plan to provide emergency economic aid to Poland and Hungary which could see the virtual disappearance of its remaining food mountains. 
The scheme, which would involve giving away the bulk of the community's unneeded meat and grain reserves, would be mainly financed by Japan and other non-community industrialised countries. 
The first indications that the industrialised countries were ready to <tag>sanction</> large-scale food aid as part of assistance to the hard-pressed economies of Poland and Hungary came during the Paris summit.   

700412
And Mr Jackson adds that the British Government has been able to influence South Africa. 
The purpose of <tag>sanctions</> was not purely punitive.   

700413
The United States thus finds itself in a no-win situation: the more it is seen to be intervening against him, the more it is likely to reinforce his position. 
Since Washington imposed economic <tag>sanctions</> on Panama last year, its economy has gone into a steep decline.   

700414
If this were all, Yeats might seem only to be adapting Wilde's aesthetic theories which had influenced him as a young man. 
But he is not only adapting them: he is giving them a supernatural <tag>sanction</>.   

700415
Other officials were more circumspect and Mrs Thatcher herself spoke cautiously of action `within a six-month timescale" possibly the Rome summit in December or even October. 
The Irish Prime Minister, Charles Haughey, refused to be drawn into what specific steps the 12 wanted to see before dropping <tag>sanctions</> altogether.   

700416
President Fidel Castro is struggling with a deepening economic crisis, made worse by his refusal to adopt Soviet-style reforms. 
Granma said there is a `silent majority" of Cuban exiles who would prefer to see a normalisation of relations with the US, describing hardline refugees opposed to an easing of <tag>sanctions</> as a minority and `ideologues of hostility".   

700417
Parliament will continue discussing the suspension today. 
THE European Community, in a significant softening of its position, yesterday praised South Africa's President F. W. de Klerk for his reforms, and said <tag>sanctions</> could be gradually relaxed. 

700418
He became known to the universal church in October 1987 when he discussed South African problems at the Rome Synod on the laity. 
Privately he preferred `selective disinvestment" to across-the-board <tag>sanctions</>.   

700419
Ironically, he once joked: `Boxing is supposed to be this heavy Mafia number, but if that's the case why haven't I been shot?" 
Mr Warren's enthusiasm for litigation when it looked as if he might be thwarted led him into a number of conflicts, most notably in February 1988 when the Board refused to <tag>sanction</> the International Boxing Federation world middleweight title fight between Tony Sibson and the American, Frank Tate, because of the IBF's unwillingness to adopt the 12-round ruling on world championship fights.   

700420
French troops yesterday set sail for the Comoros, possibly to dislodge the mercenaries, who took control of the islands two weeks ago (Photograph omitted) 
IN AN EVENT the likes of which have not been seen since the 1950s, about 2,500 delegates representing hundreds of anti-apartheid organisations from all over South Africa are due to gather at a conference in Johannesburg today in an attempt to ratify acceptance of the principle of negotiations with the government, to reiterate the call for international <tag>sanctions</> and to agree on a new plan of political action.   

700421
It is that sanctions are not being observed anyway. 
France and Germany have ignored them for years, Asia has been quick to move in, and Africa itself has traded steadily with the Republic during the sanctions years. 
From this it could be concluded that there are not enough economic benefits to be gained from ending <tag>sanctions</> to justify the political furore many politicians would feel obliged to create.   

700422
Credit limitation, coupled with a block on South African access to the International Monetary Fund and suchlike bodies, has a major impact on the economy. 
Under-the-counter evasions of agreed <tag>sanctions</> do nothing to imbue the richest country in Africa with respectability.   

700423
`Your evasions indicate that you did know the full details of the deal but that, once again, you refused to admit it," he said. 
Gordon Brown, Labour's trade spokesman, and Alex Carlile, the Liberal Democrats" legal spokesman, also renewed the attack by pressing Mr Ridley and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Attorney General, to disclose the legal advice given to Lord Young, the former Trade Secretary who <tag>sanctioned</> the deal.   

700424
If we agree your application, we will ask you to transfer your Current Account to Midland. 
Where possible we <tag>sanction</> Midland Car Loan applications right away. we like to think of them as the high-speed, high-performance loans.

3 March: 
US orders economic <tag>sanctions</>, blocks dollars 60m in government funds in US banks, and announces it will stop paying Panama Canal fees.   

700427
The summit miscalculated in trying to put pressure on the Chinese Government which had in no way offended the West or other countries, it said. 
Relations between Washington and Beijing look certain to worsen after the US Senate joined the House of Representatives in demanding new economic <tag>sanctions</>, but some Chinese experts remain optimistic.   

700428
Many Commonwealth leaders believe the movement in South Africa is the result of pressure already applied, and that only by turning the screw can the world be sure that there will be no turning back. 
African leaders who recognise that it may be difficult to impose any further <tag>sanctions</> believe they have found the way forward.   

700429
`So many have suffered for so much," Mr Mandela said. 
The Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said afterwards that despite reform in South Africa it was not time to ease economic <tag>sanctions</>. 

700430
The ANC is split. 
The ultras see every sign of Pretoria's weakness as proof of the need for another turn of the <tag>sanctions</> screw. 

700431
Argentina's President, Carlos Menem, who has made it clear that he wants good relations with Britain, provided the impulse towards normalising relations earlier this year, spurred by the realisation that Argentina could not achieve an economic agreement with the European Community unless contacts with Britain improved. 
In a variety of statements over recent months, Argentine officials have stressed their hopes for a rapid normalisation of relations and the removal of the 150-mile protection zone around the Falkland islands. 
In return for this, Argentina has offered to lift all <tag>sanctions</> against Britain and formally to end hostilities. 

700432
But it can tender for outside work in the public sector. 
The council's chief officers are the `client" &dash. they <tag>sanction</> the IT spending.   

700433
Both West Germany and America, for instance, largely share the British view of the situation, officials claim, but they say so in a far quieter tone of voice. 
Mr Hurd may seek to avoid stridency, but he will surely be opposed to any new <tag>sanctions</>; liberal he may be, but Conservative he certainly is.   

700434
But the US administration was quick to make the best of the new policy and used it to indicate that Uncle Sam was serious about ending apartheid. 
In contrast, Mrs Thatcher said the new measures agreed at Nassau 1985 were a `teeny-weeny" concession on her part and has never concealed her contempt for sanctions since. 
The <tag>sanctions</> Mrs Thatcher inherited or has agreed to are implemented with minimum policing. 

700436
Apparently caught off guard by the proposals, Peking threw up a host of pre-conditions and challenged the Dalai Lama's `sincerity". 
The oubreak of violence in March and China's subsequent military crackdown in Tibet seem to have extinguished even the faintest hopes of a negotiated settlement in the near future. 
As China's reaction to Western <tag>sanctions</> over the events in Tiananmen has shown, further international pressure on the Dalai Lama's behalf may only reinforce Peking's siege mentality and strengthen its conviction that the West is conspiring to undermine socialism in China.   

700437
Journalists at the Daily and Sunday Telegraph voted on whether to take further strike action in their dispute over pay and working practices. 
Sources at the newspapers indicated that the result, which will be known today, was likely to <tag>sanction</> more stoppages.   

700438
A limited partner is forbidden, on pain of rendering his liability unlimited, to take any part in the management of the business, and has no power to bind the firm. 
But limited partnerships are rare, private companies, which were <tag>sanctioned</> the next year by the Companies Act 198, having proved more popular.   

700439
The first is `the incredible importance that unfettered words assume in totalitarian conditions". 
He lives in a country, he writes, `where the authority and radioactive effect of words are demonstrated every day by the <tag>sanctions</> that free speech attracts.   

700440
The move caused some surprise in Whitehall, where the belief is that it would be damaging to Mr de Klerk if he were seen to be making reformist moves because of external pressure. 
If he hoped to persuade Mrs Thatcher that the releases were a favour to her and should be rewarded by her support for lifting sanctions, he will be disappointed.
