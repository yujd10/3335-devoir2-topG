`But it would also, as is equally clearly intended, prevent the refusal of a job or dismissal of an individual solely on the grounds that he or she is not a trade unionist." 
In practice, he added, most trade unionists already realised that the key to their collective agreements was `not some obligation enforceable in law but the consent of the enployees and their belief that membership of the union is in their best interest." 
Enactment of the charter would also protect employees from dismissal when lawfully on strike, and would put an end to the `offensive notion" &dash. expected in the Employment Bill &dash. of the selective <tag>sacking</> of union officials when on unofficial strike.

Top of this list is probably Mr Kenneth Clarke, who has chosen to conduct a war of attrition with the British Medical Association and will have to see it through, win or lose. 
Mr Paul Channon may also have hoped for another job instead of transport, even if the outcome is more likely to be a warm handshake and the proverbial peerage.

Cabbagetown is also packed with folklore. 
When Myrla and Ken visit the Royal Ontario Museum, the insects in the glass cases remind them that for children, dragonflies are darning needles; if they alight on your face they may sew up your lips; grasshoppers spit tobacco; to kill a spider is to bring rain; to step on a crack in the sidewalk is to break your mother's back. 
There are many depictions of children's street games and rhymes as well as references to sugar <tag>sacks</> that serve as dish towels.

But the technique felt laboured, and may have confused anyone not familiar with the book to which Lodge, in his own screenplay, sticks fairly closely. 
A few scenes stood out awkwardly: Robyn soothing her tearful female student who can't do her essay because has to do a bit of modelling to make up her grant (`It's not fair," she sobs, in one of the script's less ingenious lines); Robyn's unlikely outburst at a Pringle meeting when an Asian worker is nominated for <tag>sacking</>.

After Monday night's meeting, race director Chris Brasher, who founded the event ten years ago, announced that his deputy David Griffiths will have less say in the running of the event but will instead work to produce a plan to develop it into the next century. 
The formula was seen as a reprieve for Griffiths, who was sacked by Brasher immediately after this year's marathon in April. 
His appeal against the <tag>sacking</> was widely expected to fail after he was believed to have upset fellow directors by criticising the event's organisation.   

700121
He talks of his determination to stay with the `upright" technique until he realised that if he did not fall in with the horizontal Soviet style he was going to miss out on the Olympics for the second time &dash. he was in the squad pulled out of the Moscow games. 
With a week to the first game in Los Angeles Taylor reached a compromise with his manager, not being prepared to lie down like a <tag>sack</> of potatoes, and the `flying bedspread" method was developed with success and led to an Olympic bronze medal.

The construction of this block comprised a ground-storey brickwork plinth, perforated with a handful of windows where these were necessary to light the interior, surmounted by a timber-framed and boarded upper-storey structure, a third `attic" storey being accommodated largely in the void formed by the steep-sided pitched roof. 
From the gable of the south-west elevation projects a boarded `lucarne", or sack hoist enclosure, a feature which is characteristic of many older flour mills. because this main block is quite wide at more than 8m (26ft), and the considerable weight of stored grain and flour <tag>sacks</> had to be supported safely, the span of the floors between the flank walls was halved by introducing a central row of cylindrical cast-iron columns sited at approximately 2m (6-1/2ft) from front to rear.

He and his team were trying to get to the bottom of the inquiry into Guinness announced by the Department of Trade and Industry on December 1, 1986. 
He said several areas of interest had been identified: the role, if any, of the convicted Wall Street insider dealer, Ivan Boesky, in the #2.7 billion Distillers bid; the part, if any, played by the US group Schenley Industries; allegations of shares being `parked" with the merchant bankers, Henry Ansbacher; and the role of Bank Leu of Switzerland. 
Sir David said that Guinness director, Sir Norman Macfarlane, who was to take over as chairman after Mr Saunders's <tag>sacking</> in January 1987, `had been keen at a much earlier stage &dash. I can't pin down the time" for Mr Saunders to leave.

They start in September with the little matter of sending out some 29,000 order forms to those who have bought cards before. 
Then it is simply a question of dealing with the daily intake of 300-plus letters, packing the cards and filling a Post Office van with some 40 mail <tag>sacks</> each day.

It may be true that the great majority of her supporters at Westminster want nothing of the Social Charter and true also, as she declared at Question Time yesterday, that the Commons would not be willing to accept stages two and three of the Delors Report on economic and monetary union. 
At the same time, she must be aware that her European policy has thoroughly unsettled her party and divided her Cabinet, from the fiasco of her campaign for the European elections in June through to her clumsy <tag>sacking</> of Sir Geoffrey Howe from the Foreign Office in July and the damaging resignation of Nigel Lawson.   

700137
A nationwide boycott was launched as part of a campaign for reinstatement by the workers, who lost their jobs at Pergamon last May after staging a one-day strike in a dispute over union recognition.

Whistling to himself, Henry laid the table, while, in the corner of the kitchen, Maisie finished her last chocolate bar and got to work on a packet of crisps, a tube of Rollos, half a pound of jellybabies and a jumbo bar of Turkish delight. 
As she ate she cast worried glances up towards the cupboard by the stove, where lay a small <tag>sack</> of potato crisps, some Liquorice Allsorts and two packets of biscuits.

This arcane and boring controversy already has taken heavy toll of the Government. 
Although the man in the street has little interest in the EMS, and probably only one in a thousand could say what it was, ructions with her most senior colleagues have contributed to the spectacular dissatisfaction ratings reported by the pollsters this weekend, including ours. 
Last July's furore over the <tag>sacking</> of Sir Geoffrey from the Foreign Office and the present crisis following the resignation of Mr Lawson are, essentially, one and the same crisis &dash. a crisis over the Government's basic policy towards Europe.

Frankie stared at the floor and tried not to think of all the things he might have done, or failed to do, to cause this latest upset. 
It occurred to him that he had not worn his best clothes for many weeks; not since that confusing afternoon when some of Buddie's friends had rushed through the house carrying boxes, cases and <tag>sacks</> that must not be discovered when the police came to search the place.

His manager had been given the impression that it was all right to sell after the deadline as long as the furniture was suitably labelled. 
It was reported at the meeting of Cassington Parish Council that ARC had promised to give materials for the surfacing of the Green and Mr Rowe had agreed to organise the spreading of the hardcore and top soil in the late spring or early summer. 
In reply to the clerk's letter about the possible provision of plastic bags, West Oxfordshire District Council's environmental health department said the idea had been considered but had been discarded for several reasons such as cost, storage and delivery problems and a probable increase in litter with rubbish being spilt from the <tag>sacks</> due to animals interference or sacks being dumped on the roadside before the scheduled collection time.

He is now a bald-headed Buddhist and wears orange robes and orange flip-flops (in all weathers).

Yesterday's decision was hardly a surprise. 
This season the 43-year-old Kendall has fallen from favour with the Basque club's supporters, as the team slumped to mid-table after a promising start, losing their last three games &dash. including a 1-0 home loss to Barcelona in the Spanish Cup &dash. in the space of seven days. 
Indeed, Kendall's <tag>sacking</> seemed inevitable when, after their 4-0 away defeat to John Toshack's Real Madrid on Saturday, Aurtenetxe pointedly refused to respond to an invitation to give his manager a vote of confidence, and announced that `steps will be taken to arrest the club's decline".   

700221
The next half-hour went smoothly, as though to a timetable. 
When Fiona had finished with the bathroom she got most of the stuff from the kitchen into a couple of the My Mum's black <tag>sacks</> she had brought with her and carried them out and up to the corner of the square, where they would presumably either be collected or, on a longer view, become part of the scenery.

Informed sources within CITES yesterday indicated that a number of allegations of corruption within the secretariat had been fully investigated by its standing committee without any evidence of wrongdoing being found. 
It is, however, increasingly felt by members of CITES delegations and the many observer groups from the world of conservation that Lapointe's position is becoming untenable and he will be forced to resign &dash. probably before the next CITES meeting, expected to be held in 1992. 
The <tag>sacking</> demand by conservationists was contained in a letter to Dr Mustapha Tolba, the executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, which is the supervising body for CITES.

Paris &dash. The commander of the Iranian Navy was removed yesterday from his post and replaced by a senior commander from the Revolutionary Guards, writes Safa Haeri.

Both windmills and watermills were built taller or larger to accommodate additional machinery and grain storage space, and an extra floor was often provided above the rest of the accommodation so that grain could be emptied into bulk storage bins and led through spouts to millstones as required. 
In modern mills, grain is stored in silos which are often separate from the mill and near to a bulk intake point. 
The business of manhandling <tag>sacks</> has been replaced by automation, the grain being conveyed mechanically or pneumatically direct to the mill.   

700261
But if Mrs Thatcher took the headlines by trying to spoil Mr Mitterrand's Bicentenary, let there be no mistake about the fact that the French had spoilt it first.

However in order to avoid creating unsightly surroundings, obstructing the highway, and to reduce scavenging by animals please DO NOT put your refuse at the kerbside earlier than the evening before collection day. 
The Council will collect refuse from your side way, or from your `back door" (if that's at ground level) but the distance must be no more than 25 paces from the kerb and access must be adequate and safe for a refuse collector carrying a bin or <tag>sack</>.

Dustbins (either metal or plastic) must be to British Standards &dash. look for the `kitemark".

We don't laugh at toy guns any more, but cucumbers are still funny. 
If Scotland Yard formed a Serious Vegetable Squad &ellip. if Conan Doyle had written The Sprout of the Baskervilles or The Giant Radish of Sumatra &ellip. if people hit each other on the head with bags of brown sugar instead of <tag>sacks</> of wet sand &dash. well, it would only lower the tone of violence and make it seem frivolous.
