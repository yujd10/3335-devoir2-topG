FATHERS should be made to pay some maintenance for their children, irrespective of their financial circumstances or whether they were ever married to the mothers of their children, Michael Meacher, Labour's social security spokesman, is urging. 
Mr Meacher hopes there will be a <tag>promise</> in Labour's next general election manifesto to make it much easier for single parents to claim maintenance for themselves and their children from the absent partner.   

700002
But this was true of everybody who got a TV licence. 
I suppose if we had known more we might have been skeptical about their <tag>promises</>; but we should probably have had to be skeptical about all the applicants.

HEALTH JOBS: 
The Government yesterday delivered on the first part of its <tag>promise</> to cut NHS hospital waiting lists, with the announcement of 35 new consultant posts.   

700012
Vick Aiken compiled this report on Thursday. 
Shimon Peres' best chance of forming a government probably came and went when two members of an orthodox religious party caused an uproar in parliament while renegeing on a <tag>promise</> to join the Labour Party coalition. 

700014
Too Soon for Love was, like Cry Baby Killer, straightforward sensationalism of the still current topic of youth rebellion and teenage violence, yet another sequel to Rebel Without a Cause with Nicholson playing a secondary role in a gang of second-rate, cut-price actors who had clearly been chosen to look like the originals in the Dean film. 
Two other roles secured in that year, 1960, held better <tag>promise</> but in the end brought him no further progression in his career.  

700017
Electronic tolls could replace fuel and vehicle taxes as the main form of highway revenue. 
Notwithstanding this <tag>promise</>, the use of road pricing to change travel habits still seems some way off.  

700025
The law was passed three weeks after the assembly voted to allow `associations of a political nature" independent of the FLN for the first time since Algerian independence in 1962. 
This followed <tag>promises</> of political reform by President Chadli Benjedid in the wake of street unrest last autumn, during which hundreds of rioting youths were killed by the army.   

700028
The Americans had the industrial resources to develop this and, arnied with the British secret, had atomic bombs ready by 1945. 
The British received no acknowledgement or reward, other than a personal <tag>promise</> from Roosevelt to Churchill that Great Britain should share fully in all nuclear advances. 

700031

700035
That is why this morning's Beirut newspapers carry an appeal from his sister Peggy to her brother's captors. 
`I have no new words with which to beg for Terry's freedom, no <tag>promises</> to make, no options to pursue," she writes.   

700038
It was more a symbol than a cause. 
The treaty of Locarno rested on the assumption that the <tag>promises</> given in it would never have to be made good &dash. otherwise the British government would not have given them. 

700039
First, because identification with one's community is morally worthwhile, and acceptance of the authority of the state an appropriate way (though not the only way) to express it, one may jump to the conclusion that one has an obligation to accept the authority of the state, or even that it has authority independently of such acceptance. 
Reflection on the analogous case of <tag>promises</> dispels this impression. 

700050
Besides, sometimes a person's consent to a right or benefit is required for him to acquire that right or a benefit. 
Consent, in other words, differs from <tag>promises</> by being capable of investing the consentor with rights.   

700054
George Bush had scored a major success, not only in his propaganda battle with Mr Gorbachev, but also in terms of his leadership role in Nato. 
With Europe so full of change and <tag>promise</>, the temptation to have something new in Malta could prove overwhelming &dash. for both the participants.   

700057
`We have come to liberate their country; they have been waiting for us." 
The Israelis came like the Syrians, with expressions of innocence and with <tag>promises</> that they had arrived only to restore the sovereignty of Lebanon. 

700058
An Equal Opportunities Commission, set up by the 1975 Act, oversees the working of the Acts: it may conduct formal investigations, and seek to enforce the law by civil proceedings. 
Historically there seems to be no doubt that the English Common Law required nothing for the celebration of a marriage beyond the declared agreement of the parties, which might take the form either of a declaration of present intention, or of a <tag>promise</> to marry followed by actual union.   

700062
She managed to write with critical detachment, while at the same time conveying her personal feelings of sadness and revulsion. 
Her choice of material was a bold one, yet she was clearly not writing to create scandal, and her ability to treat such a potentially shocking subject in a down-to-earth and unprejudiced manner shows great journalistic <tag>promise</>."   

700065
Under a bill approved on first reading at a full session of the new Soviet parliament, many of the obstacles &dash. both in law and through the arbitrary ruling of some official &dash. which aroused so much controversy in the past will be removed, in compliance with agreements signed by 35 European nations in Vienna. 
Some of its provisions merely give legislative shape to <tag>promises</> already made: for instance a shortening to a maximum of five years of the ban on leaving the country imposed on those deemed to possess state secrets, as well as moves to speed the processing of exit visa applications.   

700074
NORMAN FOWLER, Secretary of State for Employment, yesterday launched initiatives to boost youth training including the widening of the 18-month-old inner city compacts scheme. 
Speaking at the Confederation of British Industry's annual conference, Mr Fowler said the number of compacts &dash. where educational authorities agree with companies over standards in return for <tag>promises</> to employ pupils &dash. would be increased by 50 per cent to 60 and, as part of the transfer of responsibilities to the new Training and Enterprise Councils, would now come under TEC control.   

700093
No doubt Lady B, the adjudication panel's `special guest", lamented the lack of an oboist in the final. 
Whether the gold and silver clarinettists have quite the charismatic muscianship of Fiona Shaw, who richly earned the laurels of the LPO-Pioneer Competition earlier this year, remains to be seen. 
Marina Finamore showed the most orchestral <tag>promise</>, rising to her Freischutz solo with a sure instinct for dramatic narrative and equally well-adjusted to her colleagues in the Debussy excerpt.   

700096
Farringdon was probably the brains behind the rebellion. 
He avoided being identified as a leader and, while Jack Straw and John Ball were hanged and Wat Tyler was dragged out of Bart's Hospital to be executed, Farringdon escaped with a year in prison and ended his days as a prosperous country squire. 
Richard reneged on nearly all his <tag>promises</> but he did approve Parliament's amnesty for all but a few of the rebels and never looked at a poll tax again.   

700102
Volatile interest and exchange rates have undermined investors' confidence both at home and abroad and forced funds out of the bond market into alternative investments such as cash or non-sterling bonds. 
Worse still, there are growing fears that the new Chancellor could stifle activity in one of the crucial areas of the sterling bond market where business has shown a little <tag>promise</>.   

700103
Education chiefs at County Hall will also be asked to open up school sixth forms to the consultation. 
A cash deposit on bottles and drinks cans should be introduced by the Government to reduce litter and waste, said members of Oxford County Council's environmental committee.

Mr Gorbachev and I are not in some kind of competition &ellip. this meeting represents a point of departure, the beginning of a process, as full of <tag>promise</> as any that we know." 

700111
The Chancellor has accepted there is no chance of inflation hitting his Budget target of 5.5 per cent by the end of 1989, but yesterday he would not confirm reports that he hoped for a decline to 6 per cent by the year's end. 
Mr Michael Meacher, Labour's employment spokesman, said he would have more confidence in the Chancellor's claims if he had not made the same <tag>promise</> before every rise in the past six months. 

700114
The return of Sputnik &dash. announced by Rudolph Schulze, the minister for postal affairs &dash. eradicates the extraordinary anomaly whereby the authorities in East Berlin appeared to regard the Soviet Union itself as a revisionist threat. 
There were <tag>promises</> yesterday of freer travel, too. 

700119
AMONG Jews the same is happening: liberal rabbis appeal to the Bible with as much fervour as fundamentalists. 
Instead of God's territorial <tag>promises</> to the Jews, they find the fierce warnings of the prophets that no society can stand if it is not just.   

700121
I've doubts about what is God, though I believe there is something. 
The point is that, despite my lack of religious beliefs, I do not want vows and <tag>promises</> to be kept totally, and yet I don't believe that people are totally monogamous and so marriage seems out of the question.   

700122
An enriching experience, personal fulfillment, intellectual challenge and plenty of hard work. 
These are the <tag>promises</> held out by a pioneering new master of arts course at Oxford Polytechnic, which starts this autumn.   

700128
The election, whose result is not expected until at least Friday, will be decided by the 6 per cent of voters who remained undecided before going into the polling booths. 
Until early this year Mr Collor was the little-known governor of a backward north-eastern state. 
By combining criticism of President Jose Sarney's unpopular government with <tag>promises</> to eradicate abuses by civil servants, Mr Collor shot to prominence.   

700131
Tom Crosby, the chief ambulance officer, said the cases demonstrated that a safe and reliable service could not be run in London under current restrictions. 
The accusations were repeated by Kenneth Clarke, Secretary of State for Health, who said that the crews were breaking a <tag>promise</> to cover 999 calls.   

700134
Mr Gandhi may have been humiliated, but no more so than N T Rama Rao, the Andhra Pradesh film star and opposition chief minister, who not only lost control of his state assembly, but was defeated in his own assembly seat. 
Only in West Bengal, where the Communist Party of India has made at least some effort to fulfil past election <tag>promises</>, did voters increase their support for an incumbent regime.   

700135
It cannot be used to establish that they already have such a right. 
Some of the points made in the previous sections can be illustrated and clarified by using them to explain the rights involved in <tag>promises</> and agreements.   

700136
No blueprint devised in Washington could improve on the political scenario at presented being enacted in Eastern Europe. 
That is why George Bush has been right to adopt a low profile as people-power on the streets of East Germany and Czechoslovakia has wrung <tag>promises</> of reform from reluctant communist leaders.   

700137
But a world ranking of 222 shows there is still a lot of room for improvement. 
Yesterday, she showed <tag>promise</> again, however, when she outlasted experienced Italian, Sandra Cecchini, who is ranked 25th in the world, 6-4, 4-6, 10-8, in a match of rollercoaster emotions that lasted three hours.   

700143
It begins `Lady &ellip 
" Here, where he assigns the role of `Lady of silences", the frail memory of love &dash. `Rose of memory" &dash. supports the end of a tormented life with a <tag>promise</> of renewal. 

700152
Rare Topaze is a half-brother to Fast Topaze, a Group One winner on the Flat in France. 
He's never run in any sort of race, but has shown tremendous <tag>promise</> at home and should be ready to do himself justice on his debut at Kempton this afternoon." 

700161
Neither did Gerrard. 
Gerrard said evenly: `I want your <tag>promise</>, John, that you will not leave this place until we agree it is wise for you to do so. 

700163
His theory is that, as they were fourth on the water, the Spanish are at least fourth favourites to win. 
He rates only the Nippon Challenge and the New Zealanders ahead in his own group and feels that, although the French show <tag>promise</>, they are dogged by lack of funds (it was subsequently announced that French funding by the City of Paris was likely).   

700166
He said that The Soldier's Tale, too, was quite unlike anything else being done in South Africa then. 
John was full of invention, always making up steps and sequences which he called by odd names: for instance a stamping step he called `Sherman tanks", which he devised for the zephyrs in Primavera and used again for the unicorns in Harlequin in April. 
Although people in the Cape Town ballet world thought highly of his <tag>promise</>, John's talent as a choreographer was not regarded as proved by the time he left South Africa (at only eighteen, why should it have been?), and other young choreographers were at least as highly thought of. 

700169
An undertaker was one who contracted to `undertake" a drainage scheme;  an `adventurer" was one who `adventured" his capital on such an undertaking. 
The security of both was the <tag>promise</> of a large proportion of the land after the  drainage operation had been successfully completed. 

700170
The ministry, he said, had been on alert since Sunday, and even the minister, Ferenc Karpati, had stayed in the building every night. 
He revealed that Mr Karpati had been in close touch with Vasile Milea, his Romanian counterpart and received a pledge that the Romanian army would not fire on the people. 
Mr Karpati had been informed by the Deputy Chief of Staff of Romania yesterday that Mr Milea had been killed because he had kept his <tag>promise</>.   

700174
In the meantime, many pre-revolution legacies have been abolished by decree laws, as the interim government sets about dismantling the apparatus of the Ceausescu regime. 
The State Planning Committee has been scrapped, in line with the new rulers' <tag>promise</> to favour free enterprise.   

700180
You'll enjoy standards of service and food which are amongst the best in Europe. 
In fact, we have clients who book from our brochure year after year: the result of a <tag>promise</> of a holiday with no nasty surprises &dash. just personal service and high standards.   

700182
The Scots restored some pride by hitting back with three goals &dash. from Mixu Paatelainen (42), Michael O'Neill (61) and John Clark (89). 
RUGBY UNION received one <tag>promise</> of more than #30m yesterday and made another less cast-iron pledge that the sport would remain amateur.   

700183
America wept unashamedly. 
They knew Kent Black had ridden home and the <tag>promise</> that there would be one last use for their money grabbed their imaginations and their hearts.   

700186
Pearl Harbour changed the face of the war. 
The strength of the United States was now engaged and held out the <tag>promise</> of final victory over the Axis Powers.   

700188
While this measure may be vulnerable on logical grounds,{fo id=136} the manoeuvre was obviously intended to benefit the tort claimant who was, of course, not a party to the contract. 
Indeed, henceforth, it became the practice for the insured to assign his claim against the insurance company to the tort plaintiff, typically in return for a <tag>promise</> to co-operate with the latter in future litigation over liability.   

700189
The Americans had the industrial resources to develop this and, arnied with the British secret, had atomic bombs ready by 1945. 
The British received no acknowledgement or reward, other than a personal promise from Roosevelt to Churchill that Great Britain should share fully in all nuclear advances. 
This <tag>promise</> lapsed on Roosevelt's death, and the British had to start out again on their own.   

700191
Now I have to spend hours reading the papers to know what is going on." 
This explosion of freedom in East Germany's media is one of the few tangible changes so far amid the many nebulous <tag>promises</> of the leadership.  

700195
But it is not like the change of reasons which is occasioned by loss of strength through age, or the absence of money due to past extravagances. 
Rather it is like the change occasioned by promising: a creation, in that case, of a duty one did not have before. 
For, whatever reasons one had to make the <tag>promise</>, its making transforms one's reasons, creating a new reason not previously there.   

700197
`Now we're saying that there has to be a complete ban on overtime and that they should resist moral blackmail." 
RELATIONS between the British Medical Association and Kenneth Clarke, the Secretary of State for Health, reached a fresh low last night, as doctors' leaders accused him of appearing to renege on <tag>promises</> that patients' drugs would not be cash-limited under the Government's National Health Service plans.   

700202
To these oppressions, the First World War added unforeseen horrors, particularly where, in the western borderlands, actual fighting took place. 
The <tag>promise</> of peace and order which was the supposed vindication of the Tsarist empire was completely betrayed.   

700203
For very large and relatively inactive databases, magnetic tape offers a practical and cost-effective alternative to disk. 
(Optical storage, if it meets its <tag>promise</>, may offer magnetic disk performance at magnetic tape costs.)   

700204
We all have great hopes for the future but these hopes are not yet certainties. 
`These changing circumstances, full of <tag>promise</> but also of uncertainty, will have implications for the deployment and structure of our forces.  

700207
AT CAPE TOWN University Hilliard Festenstein, a distinguished immunologist, was a fairly average student and even today many of his contemporaries are surprised at the heights he reached. 
Shortly after qualifying in Medicine, he came to England to study a Diploma in Bacteriology and returned to the South African Institute of Medical Research where early on he showed his <tag>promise</>. 

700210
His charity-begins-at-home appeal will hopefully have its effect in practical cash terms. 
But the truth of the matter is that brilliant surgeons such as the JR can boast should not have to be in the business of going round suggesting where the begging bowl should be held out next. 
Any Government that cared a jot about its good name and its <tag>promise</> to protect the NHS would be making sure that the necessary funds were available.   

700215
It is probably the only time that Quebec nationalists have had a good word to say of me. 
In its early years the BBG had its shortcomings; beyond question we made mistakes, and some of them were big ones. 
For example, we accepted far too readily the grandiose <tag>promises</> of applicants for TV licences.   

700220
`A long story," she said, `I'll tell you sometime." 
She heard the invitation, the <tag>promise</> of a future, in her voice and was surprised. 

700221
Westminster, for all its failings, never faced that threat. 
GERMANS in East and West reacted with disappointment and scepticism yesterday to a <tag>promise</> by the East German leaders to talk about change.   

700229
An industry so used to repeats should not be surprised that the Bill is little more than `The White Paper on Broadcasting: Part II". 
Though the Government has enshrined &dash. in bold lettering, no less &dash. that franchises will be sold to the highest bidder, the pure Thatcherite philosophy is watered down by some interesting riders. 
All bidders have to put up a performance bond to make sure they live up to their <tag>promises</>.  

700234
He agreed that without a friendly settlement of the candidate question and a unified opposition campaign, the Janata Dal could not hope to win. 
Whoever ends up fighting the election, Mr Kishen suggested, royal parentage will not matter as much to Bharatpur voters as the government's abysmal record on rural development, inflation and corruption and its failure to fulfil <tag>promises</> made during the 1984 campaign.   

700238
It was unclear how many men had gone back to work in the Kuzbass, but the strike appeared virtually over. 
The men seem to have heeded Mr Gorbachev's warning that the strikes were threatening his whole reform programme, and to have accepted government's <tag>promises</> of a huge influx of food and consumer goods to the region. 

700240
One suspects that this has become an even more dominant consideration as the project's costs have escalated. 
Far from being impressed by Mr Morton's <tag>promise</> of a 3 1/2 &dash. year public relations programme `to demonstrate the safety of our shuttle system", I just wish that Eurotunnel had started with an open-minded assessment of alternatives, including the segregation of passengers and vehicles.   

700243
But in lengthy talks with the strikers, neither the minister for the coal industry, Mr M Shchadov, nor the first secretary of the Kemerevo regional party committee, Mr A Melnikov, managed to persuade them to go back, even though, as the government newspaper Izvestiya put it, the miners `are knocking at an open door". 
Only the trade union newspaper Trud explained why the strikers were holding out &dash. the miners do not trust the authorities. 
`Remembering countless previous unfulfilled <tag>promises</> of a better life," the paper said, `people treat the latest promises with mistrust."   

700245
He will be ideally suited by the six furlongs and has won his last two races in fluent style. 
I liked Guy Harwood Groombridge the first time I saw him at Sandown and he confirmed his <tag>promise</> next time out at Goodwood with a comfortable victory.   

700255
It was accepted that by promising to pay the extra #10,300 the defendants secured benefits. 
There was no suggestion that the promise was given as a result of fraud or duress. 
The proposition did not contravene the principle in Stilk v Myrick, but refined and limited the application of the principle which was left unscathed where B secured no benefit by his <tag>promise</>.   

700256
Soviet Russia had much aid to offer, Great Britain comparatively little, and Roosevelt, opportunistic as ever, subordinated every other aim to that of securing Russian aid. 
He succeeded: Stalin gave a <tag>promise</> of further Russian offensives against Hitler and, even more important, a solid promise that Russia would enter the war against Japan three months after the end of the European war.   

700259
An extract from a recent edition of The World Today summed up the standard economic and democratic reforms in the USSR in the form of economic and industrial assistance. 
It is the &dash. still distant &dash. <tag>promise</> of such a change held by the present developments that should make the West view Gorbachev's attempts sympathetically.   

700261
At Wembley, though, it was something of a business doing pleasure with him. 
O'Neal made a vague <tag>promise</> that a new album would be out next March, and offered us a couple of ordinary-sounding numbers by way of a trailer.   

700262
They acquired a significance that grew ever more painful as weeks and then months away from home turned into years. 
Younger Palestinians &dash. Palestinians who were born in Lebanon, for example &dash. can remember how their parents angrily threw the keys away in the early 1950s, how the documents that were guarded with such care in the initial days of exile were mislaid or destroyed as their true meaning became clear; because they proved ownership of a world that had disappeared. 
For the keys &dash. often made of thick grey iron, sometimes with decorated handles &dash. were in a sense a <tag>promise</> of return, a promise that history inevitably broke.   

700264
With his budget already allocated when he got there, Miller is trying to find money and air time for baseball's World Series. 
Last week the company signed a new three-year agreeement to televise American football, so the <tag>promise</> for the autumn is greater.

`He is the Arab hero," enthused one passer-by in Baghdad this week, unprompted by your correspondent. 
`Nasser made <tag>promises</>, but could not deliver.

EXHIBITORS from 59 countries at the first World Handicraft Trade Fair in London have criticised the organisers for alleged failures of organisation and publicity after the event failed to attract enough buyers. 
Mr Bertoldo Machusius, a trader from Guatemala who spent more than #15,000 on his stand at Olympia, Earls Court, said: `The organisers failed to live up to their <tag>promise</> to attract trade buyers from all over Europe.   

700272
The contrary is the case. 
Making <tag>promises</> about conduct in the more remote future is one way in which children develop a sense of responsibility, a capacity to think ahead and plan, etc.   

700273
Recruitment is increasingly difficult, particularly to the police force where morale has sunk to a new low. 
The sense of community has not been improved by Britain's <tag>promise</> of an ungenerous package which will limit refuge to those deemed to have served the Crown well, or to hold `sensitive" positions.  

700276
Liberal Democrat leader Mrs Sheila Terry labelled it `garbage". 
Mr Plaskitt said: `It confirms that the fast-buck merchants are now in control of the Tory group." 
`The document is full of glib commercial language, strong on <tag>promises</> of saving and efficiency.   

700280
Taking into account the talent available to both teams, the first 25 minutes of the game had to be classed as dismal. 
The fact that huge areas of Rangers' normally packed stand remained empty suggested that fans were not deluded by pre-match <tag>promises</> of total commitment. 

700282
Not because they are too pornographic, but because the services they publicise are not pornographic enough. 
Mr Norton said that a recent amendment to British Telecom contracts meant that the sex line companies had to comply with the British Code of Advertising's requirement that promotion was legal, decent, honest and truthful. 
`It's hard to see how the XXX-rated advertisements in the Sunday Sport, with their <tag>promises</> of `live sex action" and graphic illustrations do this," he said.   

700284
SCORPIO (Oct 24-Nov 22): How can you expect others to believe what you say, if you don't show you have faith in your own principles and precepts? 
Colleagues, comrades and companions may need a practical example to follow rather than a haze of theoretical <tag>promises</> and assurances. 

700286
Thus, I may consent to my daughter's marriage, to be governed by the decisions of the majority, or to my friend's handling my financial affairs. 
Promises, on the other hand, cannot, except in very special circumstances, ever be made concerning the actions of another person. 
Further, while both <tag>promises</> and consent generate special rights and obligations, the emphases in the two cases are different. 

700287
Worcestershire finished apprehensively on 49 for four, but Rhodes was still there. 
LIKE General MacArthur, who fulfilled his <tag>promise</> to return after leaving the Philippines to the Japanese in 1942, John McEnroe is determined to keep the pledge he made after his defeat at the hands of Kevin Curren at the quarter-final stage of Wimbledon in 1985.   

700288
He may also have to fight off a takeover bid &dash. Fininvest, the Milan-based media company controlled by Silvio Berlusconi revealed a 1 per cent holding last week. 
Elsewhere in the media world, LWT has come up with a new plan to restructure itself ahead of the new franchise auction in 1992. 
The scheme, which is not popular with some of the group's investors, includes tying in 40 of its top managers with the <tag>promise</> of an equity stake in the business.   

700290
The fact that workers `are taking matters thoroughly into their own hands greatly inspires me, despite all the drama of events," he declared. 
Siberian miners have transformed their strike committee into a `watchdog committee" to check on the fulfilment of government <tag>promises</> &dash. which Mr Gorbachev repeated would apply to all coal regions.   

700297
But artistically, as a phenomenon which can hypnotise us, Tennant is the creation of Beaton's camera. 
Throughout his life, Tennant contemplated these extraordinary images of the pansy boy as quintessence, and applied gums and coloured sticks to his face in an attempt to recapture himself. 
His life was a process of displacement, compensation and hiding, made desperate through lack of physical relationships and the knowledge of failed <tag>promise</>.   

700299
Even in the stage-managed splendour of Red Square, dissent flickered, this time from the conservative end of the spectrum. 
`No to rising prices", complained one placard. 
`Fewer words and more deeds", demanded another, in silent rebuke of the <tag>promises</> which have brought so far little but empty shelves.   

700302
First, the Conservative manifesto at the 1987 general election pledged that child benefit `will continue to be paid as now" &dash. previous practice having been to uprate it annually. 
That pledge has been fulfilled only in its most literal sense: benefit has remained at #7.25 a week. 
Either the <tag>promise</> was made in the knowledge that child benefit would be, or was likely to be, reduced in real terms, or the spirit of the undertaking has been cynically flouted.   

700309
His controversial deputy prime minister, Devi Lal, takes on the agricultural brief, while the new Minister of Finance is Professor Madhu Dandavate, a minister of railways in the last Janata government and a respected academic. 
It will be Professor Dandavate's task to find a way of keeping Mr Singh's most alluring election <tag>promise</> &dash. to bring down prices.   

700315
You begin to appreciate why Newley has become a rich and famous celebrity playing poor failed nobodies. 
And, in the end, if much of the <tag>promise</> is still unfulfilled, in his own words, `I ain't done too bad.   

700318
If the Foreign Secretary and Witney MP, Douglas Hurd, thought he was going to get any change from the Israeli government, he now knows he was wrong. 
After three hours of talks in Jerusalem with Prime Minister Yitsak Shamir and Foreign Minister David Levy, he came away with little more that a <tag>promise</> of more talks about the plight of the Palestinians.   

700319
A flawless sergeant-major, the very model of a non-commissioned officer, entered the room. 
He had the instinctive grace and training to project awe at being admitted to the presence of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, yet he was also able to provide a sense of equality-through-utility as if rank were co-equal with function, that Chay might be the Army, but he and other non-coms made the Army possible. 
Kullers was of average height, a long-waisted man who would appear as a giant when seated, and who, in the sense of dense muscularity and the <tag>promise</> of protection to all who came into his care, suggested a large and indestructible tree.   

700327
This is actually three ounces of sweets.

If this were so the difference between ought and duty would present no difficulty to the rights-theorists, for they may claim that they merely use `duty" as equivalent to `ought", and can use `weighty duty" as equivalent to the normal `duty". 
The two examples above refute the suggestion that the difference between one's duties and what one simply ought to do is in the weight of the supporting reason since there is probably more reason to let my locked-out neighbour use my phone than to saw off the branch this week rather than next week. 
This is so even if one takes account of the harm my breaking my <tag>promise</> does to the reliability and credibility of promises between neighbours and in general.

As a result of these cost escalations, and the poor response to Ken Russell's Gothic (1986), Virgin withdrew from production, and confined itself to putting up <tag>promises</> of cash in return for distribution rights.

BRITISH Steel yesterday provoked fresh speculation that it is planning the complete closure of the Ravenscraig steelworks in Scotland, by pledging to consider private sector bids for the entire works if closure was forced for commercial reasons. 
The <tag>promise</> was made in an eight-page letter to the Scottish Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, in which Sir Robert Scholey, BS's chairman, defended his decision to close Ravenscraig's strip mill with the loss of 800 jobs.

Mr Mazowiecki's bold but painful macroeconomic reforms have caused a 40% drop in living standards, but railway workers were as angry about the government's failure to reform the bloated railway bureaucracy as they were about their low pay.

Easiest was the case of the seller's assurance that the car's windscreen was `shatter-proof".

Or, as the characters would probably say, this being a series infatuated with villainous jargon, `You've bin telling porkies, PC &dash. and in my manor we're strictly kosher".

The judge found that before the plaintiff ceased work, eight further flats were substantially completed and the plaintiff was entitled to receive #4,600 (8 times #575) and a reasonable proportion of the sum outstanding under the original contract. 
He decided the plaintiff was entitled to further payments of #5,000 against which he had only received #1,500, and therefore the defendants were in breach of contract, entitling the plaintiff to cease work. 
The defendants appealed on the grounds that (1) the additional payment was payable on completion not on substantial completion and (2) the <tag>promise</> to pay an additional #10,300 was unenforceable since there was no consideration for it.

The first European university to be founded &dash. that is to say, to be set up by a competent authority, endowed with a charter of privileges, and with the expectation of permanent corporate existence &dash. was the University of Naples in 1224. 
Its founder was the Emperor Frederick II and, in his grandiose way, he made many promises of advantages to both masters and students who came to his new university. 
He made these lavish <tag>promises</> not because he was doing something new, but to make up for lost time; he had to promise benefits on a generous scale in order to succeed.
