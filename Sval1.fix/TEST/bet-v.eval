On the other hand, if you went to the other end of the scale and in that same season you looked at all horses that were offered at precisely two to one on, then you'll find that there were twenty two horses which were offered at those odds and fifteen of them won. 
Now twenty two is not a large number, certainly not large enough for any statistical reliability to be placed on the result, but the fact remains that if you had <tag>bet</> on every single horse in that season at two to one on, and had bet the same amount, then you'd have finished ahead.

`Were we surprised by the speed of it? 
You <tag>bet</> your life," the Secretary of State, James Baker, said yesterday.

The trouble is we no longer have even Willie Anderson's two years, since the World Cup kicks off, England against New Zealand, on 3 October 1991. 
Even 22 months ahead of the event, is anybody out there prepared to <tag>bet</> against the Blacks?

As I have said, if you invest a pound, then on sheer rational expectations you should expect on average to get back thirty pence. 
If you invested a pound on a horse, then the amount of money you'd expect to get back would depend on the odds that that horse was offered at, but if you confined yourself to horses that had a reasonable chance of winning, say, the sort of horses that tend to be offered at odds of, say, six or seven to one or better, then your average rate of return might be nearer ninety per cent than thirty per cent, so putting it one way <tag>betting</> a pound a week on the horses is a slower way of losing your money than betting a pound a week on football pools, but football pools gives you a much greater chance of winning an absolutely astonishing sum of money.

It may be that Storehouse is heading for a sharp recovery in profits, though few would <tag>bet</> on that in current conditions.

As an intellectual exercise it is as challenging as you can get: the eyes glaze over as you explain the importance of the Takeover Panel and the Office of Fair Trading, incredulity sets in when you talk about management appeals to shareholder loyalty and by the time you get to the details of the defence document, your audience is stifling a polite yawn. 
The only language that makes a Wall Street arb sit up and take notice is price, preferably a rising one, as a corporate auction with its inherent degree of uncertainty is what this breed thrives on. 
They are takeover speculators who make money by <tag>betting</> on the outcome of a bid, trading shares in the expectation that the battle will eventually move the share price in their favour.

That's about the level of discourse. 
As I write, the only story about Germany on NBC's evening news was of an East Berliner who had returned to a West Berlin library, books borrowed the day the Wall went up.

Despite penalties providing for maximum sentences equivalent to those for grievous bodily harm, this particular ground-elder continues to flourish. 
In addition, there remains a hard core of respectable opinion that asserts that insider-trading is no more harmful than a jockey <tag>betting</> on himself to win, the argument being that the jockey's bet will move the odds and thus assist the bookies and the punters.

The conversation, as if drawn by a momentum of its own, now moved to the nature of Ms Jekyll, followed by a heated appraisal of the nature of Mrs Hyde. 
It was strange, Robina reflected, that the characteristics of these two women, barely known to anyone present, should have brought a civilized talk almost to boiling point; but that it did was incontrovertible; it was as if, she said, these two not particularly newsworthy characters stood for all the divisions we are in the midst of suffering in this county.

And that was when the captions were in sync with what we were hearing: by the end we were about three captions ahead, which was seriously distracting. 
At the end of all that Anna began a new paragraph of what would appear to have been Peter Sissons' script, stopped abruptly, and then signed off with a very cross look to allow him to repeat it again from the beginning.

So, when a fluke makes a snail secrete an extra-thick shell, the fluke is not doing the snail a good turn unless the fluke is bearing the economic cost of thickening the shell. 
And we can safely <tag>bet</> that it isn't being so generous.

And at the Department of Energy ears must still be burning. 
If so, you can <tag>bet</> that the combustion process will only take place at enormous public expense (of as yet unknown proportions) and to no very clear purpose, judging by the department's record.

World Cup fans have made the surprise hit of the year so far with Nessun Dorma from Luciano Pavarotti.

Hedge is currently on the 11 mark and Tyred N'Snookered contributed to that tally last time out when beating previous double winner James My Boy by one and a half lengths. 
Given good ground again and a favoured right-handed circuit down in Somerset, Tyred N'Snookerd is a confident nap. 
Tyred N'Snookered can initiate a double for Mark Richards who should also be on the mark on Oliver Sherwood's Mandraki Shuffle in the <tag>Bet</> With The Tote Novices' Chase Qualifier.

Of course you'll be getting an allowance from me. 
I haven't worked out how much because I can't and won't try to work out things like that, and it'll be complicated, though not beyond the wit of some man or other.

There are fifty five different numbers at the moment on the football pools, and if people made an investigation of the frequency with which certain matches were selected, then they'd find that certain numbers were selected far more frequently and others selected far less frequently than other numbers. 
Now if you knew which numbers were selected less frequently than others, and you kept that information to yourself and you <tag>bet</> on those numbers that were selected less frequently, then unless there's any special reason why those numbers should produce fewer score draws than other numbers, you're giving yourself an advantage because on the weeks in which those numbers produce score draws there are fewer people who'll have them down as their numbers, and so there's more money around for those few people who have them down, including you, and so if you win, then you'd expect to win more money.
