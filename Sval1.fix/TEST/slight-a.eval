An SD report from Berchtesgaden noted: `The broad mass couldn't care less what the future Europe looks like. 
It can be gathered from every conversation that the people's comrades from all walks of life want a return to the living standard of the pre-war era as soon as possible, and don't lay the <tag>slightest</> value on going down in history."

For hasn't this war been of immense gain to Bush and Major? 
Bush, the man who could not handle domestic politics, could not cope with his Republican Party in the budget, had displayed not the <tag>slightest</> interest in the worsening problems of poverty in the United States, could be freed to play war.

For the natural type of pool the setting should be informal.

With over 60 per cent of the French market tied up between them, the Peugeot-Citroen group and Renault could be forgiven for thinking they had little to worry about. 
That's the way it looked out in the halls as they each displayed a show car as bright as any we've seen since Tokyo last year. 
Renault in particular looked in good health despite its <tag>slight</> slip in the market this year.

He said: `Common mistakes in 1989 included travelling too fast for the road, weather or vehicle condition; making a bad judgement of the speed and distance of vehicles ; ignoring or not knowing the meaning of traffic signs and signals and the use of alcohol by all types of road user." 
In Oxford, where accident figures have been declining for five years, there was a 45 per cent jump in <tag>slight</> injury accidents, particularly among drivers and adult cyclists.

When a bloke has been sexually excited, his `love juices" tend to create a <tag>slight</> blockage in the urinary pipe for a little while.

A boy two years and a half old was cut for a stone. 
He was put to sleep in a minute; the stone was so large and the bladder so contracted, the operator could not get hold of it, and the operation lasted above twenty minutes, with repeated probings by different instruments; the chloroform was applied from time to time, and the child never exhibited the <tag>slightest</> sign of consciousness, and it was exactly the same as operating upon a dead body.

The problems arose after Reeves opened a second practice in Gloucester in addition to his Cowley Road operation, which he set up in 1968. 
He took the names of some of his Oxford patients who were exempt from charges, made <tag>slight</> alterations to their personal details and filled in forms on their behalf, forging their signatures to say they had received treatment at the Gloucester practice.

DESMOND DOUGLAS has the chance of another of his many remarkable achievements when he tries to win back the National Top 12 title at Clacton-on-Sea today. 
Even at the venerable age of 34 England's finest player since the 1950s is still performing well enough to be regarded as a <tag>slight</> favourite.

Perhaps in comparison with the polished performance which preceded it, the orchestra's playing of Brahm's Symphony No. 3, was rather less satisfactory. 
The tempo sometimes seemed to slow, and there were patches of <tag>slight</> lack-lustre playing, but the orchestra rose to the splendour of the music in the Andante and Finale.

Great Britain &ellip.10 Belgium &ellip.0 IF Britain's 2-0 win over Belgium on Thursday was welcome revenge for the 6-5 defeat in the world championships in March, the 10-0 rout of the visitors in the second game last night at Durham was as sweet as it was unexpected, writes Steve Pinder. 
Britain always had the lion's share of the game, although three Belgium players were out with <tag>slight</> injuries picked up in the game at Nottingham.

Against the dollar, sterling finished 0.60 cents firmer at dollars 1.5510, chiefly because of expectations of lower US interest rates.

This letter is particularly directed to the selfish person who, at exactly 7.55am on the morning of Sunday, March 11 stopped a car at the Witney Road entrance to Bampton-in-the-Bush and, quite openly, picked a bunch of daffodils from around the town sign. 
There is, of course, a <tag>slight</> possibility that this person was unaware of the fact that last autumn Margaret Howse and her band of helpers braved the cold weather to plant hundreds of bulbs in and around the town.

The Old Vicarage might well have served as Archdeacon Grantly's home had Trollope written of the North.

A consomme of chicken was served in a silver dish with a dusting of tiny vegetable dice, a chicken breast and ravioli containing wild mushrooms, a dainty dish. 
A grey-legged partidge had great succulence and the slightest tinge of decay. 
Its breasts were supported by a little nest of cabbage, the legs cooked crisply and the whole caboodle dipping its toes in a silky sauce of <tag>slight</> sweetness.

Now, I'm not going to go into a discussion about Dickens' view of women, which was fairly peculiar, but I do think that the popular feeling of the times was very much inclined towards the `Little Dorrits". 
I've got some quotes here that I've taken from the book which shows not only how Dickens thought women ought to behave, but how the readers, since he was writing for a public market, the readers too thought the ideal woman ought to behave. 
We have heard her described as: `a diminutive figure with small features and a <tag>slight</> spare dress; she was little and light, noiseless and shy".

We need the horse to listen to us, but we must listen to it, be receptive to it, so that we can anticipate and offset the real possibility of a horse's emotions becoming too extreme and consequently it being most uncooperative.

The walk through the grounds of Blenheim Park was held on Sunday, March 11. 
This year Mr Holley had managed 12 miles when a large blister on his heel gave warning that it was time to give up.

But all that came to him then, on the other side of yesterday's desk, was the image of an old elm withered by disease, dead branches flailing the air like Lazarus under his funeral bandages. 
And now, too, from the inside of the car, a day and a night away from Hadley and the swinging legs, he realized that the trees out there did not distinguish themselves by their sounds. 
In the frosty dusk he could just about see the quivering without hearing the hiss, just catch the rise and fall of the boughs without receiving the <tag>slightest</> hint of their rustles.

Mimi didn't know. 
`Well, they'll have to," said Nicholson pulling the necktie from his shirt and flinging it across the back of a chair. 
It was perhaps one <tag>slight</> rejection of the conformity that was expected of him that night.

Far better to remove the skirtings and replace only on the exposed length of wall once the unit is in place. 
Unless you are lucky, your units will not fit exactly the space available, leaving a gap that you can make the most of by using as a tray space or somewhere to hang towels &dash. a base and plinth can always be fitted to match in with the units but always decide before installing the units where you want the space so that it appears planned. 
Also remember when allowing for space for free-standing objects like washing machines and fridges that there must be a <tag>slight</> gap either side of an inch or so.

The two sets of figures indicate that the Treasury's policy of high interest rates is succeeding in its attack on at least two main causes of inflation &dash. consumer demand and swollen industrial profits. 
Official statistics yesterday disclosed a 0.7 per cent fall in the volume of sales in October to 121.4 (1985=100) after adjustment for seasonal influences.

They again offered strong economic backing for reforms.

Poor little England. 
Jerry Lee's nemesis is a quaint place of chirpy cockneys and sleazy hacks in Gannexes; in Bert Rigby You're a Fool (15), another rags-to-riches musical biography, Britain is a rainswept industrial hellhole of back-to-backs, bingo halls, bomb shelters and strikes: with <tag>slight</> surprise, you realise it's meant to be set in the present day.

By the clever device of employing the puppeteers as a group of Edwardians, picnicking on the river bank, and observing the carryings-on of Toad, Mole, Badger, etc., the obvious problems of how to depict animals in an adult-size world, and how to move the puppets convincingly, were overcome at a stroke. 
The puppets themselves were based on Shepard's famous illustrations, and were utterly lifelike and beautifully constructed.

It was the Doncaster Rovers manager who switched the 23-year-old from midfield to right back earlier this season, and that was the moment his career took off. 
United beat several rivals, including Bury, Wolves and Bradford City, to Robinson's signature yesterday at a cost of #150,000 with a further #50,000 after he has played 25 first team games.

But there is a suspicion in the markets that the Government would prefer a devaluation of sterling, than a further rise in interest rates. 
In reality, the <tag>slight</> shifts in policy which are likely to distinguish Mr Major's chancellorship from that of Mr Lawson ought to be pretty neutral for sterling.

It may be it is not the hair itself but possible the style of fishing associated that could be the problem. 
The hair rig has been a great leveller of angling ability and because on most waters it is self-hooking this can often lead to complacency on the angler's part.

Warrington and Hull, both without games at the weekend, were among several league clubs represented in south Wales, where Aled Williams, the Bridgend stand-off, was the reported object of interest. 
Warrington lost #69,000 last season, a <tag>slight</> improvement on the previous year, but a deficit which leaves the club with overall debts of #553,000.

For many, the oppositional nature of nonconformist art was its only true virtue.

The pattern revealed by kinship terms cannot therefore be used as evidence of marriage systems in the way that Morgan believed.

Their biased and blinkered vision is obviously such that it cannot comprehend the fact that the light-hearted deployment and disposal of a ridiculous effigy took all potential aggression out of a legitimate protest in a town with a most troublesome record of violence. 
Such deployment was carefully considered by this committee and discussed with senior police during the planning of the rally.

But entrepreneurs should not imagine they have uncovered a potentially lucrative food source.

The unusually short half-hour format and the absence of the standard personality presenter, climbing all over ruins or standing beaming in front of large edifices, gave the series a chance to be excitingly different from the rest; but some vital overall control seems to have been lacking that should have pulled the whole thing together and matched the different aspects properly to one another.

Store managers will have limited scope for selecting products to suit their own local customers, rather than simply having the same as every other store. 
And there may also be a <tag>slight</> shift to larger stores, although this applies more to Curry's, where the edge-of-town superstores are increasingly taking over from smaller High Street shops.

The next evening, after another humiliating and hopeless day at school, I came home and the scene was repeated. 
This time there were two or three attacks, again without the <tag>slightest</> provocation.

A 5 per cent annual increase in the number of adult males sentenced to custody, judges imposing longer sentences and the growing remand population accounted for the rise. 
More recently, however, there has been a <tag>slight</> drop in the total prison population &dash. there were 1,600 fewer people in prison at the end of 1989 than in 1988.

He was widely and deeply read, notably in comparative religion and the poetry and art of William Blake.

Richard was lounging in a shabby red wing chair in a far corner, reading The Field. 
Every head in the half-empty room turned as the Captain passed, partly because at 6ft 4in, white-blond and deeply tanned, he was an arresting figure, and partly because however stoutly his brother officers maintained that Second Lieutenant HRH the Prince Richard was just an ordinary bloke, gut fascination with all his actions was endemic among them. 
Alerted by this <tag>slight</> stir, Richard looked up from the account of brown trout fishing in New Zealand which had been adequate to capture his attention for ten minutes while he awaited his guest.

The programme was un-hackneyed and the performers highly accomplished, playing smoothly together with assured dynamics and timing.

I am getting married later this year and naturally my own mother wants to come to my wedding, but I know she will drink too much and make a scene if she comes. 
IF you do not invite your mother to your wedding it is quite possible that she will turn up anyway and in a troubled and perhaps aggressive state, if she feels <tag>slighted</>.

The first is that there is no particular problem on the spending side, either on the performance during the current financial year, or the plans for the next one. 
The <tag>slight</> downward adjustment in this year's public sector debt repayment is not material, and is as much the result of changes in the revenue side as on the spending side.

I was surprised to receive a letter from Eliza Jekyll on the day after her dinner party, May the eighth. 
We'd had a pleasant evening; it had been good to see an old friend in a less, I suppose one would have to say, exalted state than she had manifested on the infrequent and unsuccessful occasions of our meeting over the last year; and I must admit to a feeling of <tag>slight</> complacency on opening the envelope.

But the effort's aim was difficult to locate, and the resulting miscellany might have come from the archives of any specialists in post-war repertoire -who could also have delivered a less embarrassingly misprinted programme. 
It was a <tag>slight</> jolt, at least, to start with some Takemitsu from the 1970s: could those wispy, aphoristic opening phrases of Webernian austerity belong to the same composer who has an ever more Debussy-like premiere almost everywhere you look?

`This is well-designed and stylish, has a handy pocket at the front, and the adjustable, padded nylon straps give added support so aren't a strain on the back.

Both are long on tradition but short on achievement of late and looking for a considerable improvement after fighting relegation campaigns of contrasting success last season. 
Those of us who witnessed the gripping quarter-final between the two teams in January, won in the last minute by West Ham, will need more convincing proof that significant progress has been made in the interim. 
The impression that it was some sort of goalkeepers' benefit night was reinforced when Kevin Gage belted a ground shot straight at Phil Parkes from improbable range and Slater loosed off three drives in quick succession, none of which posed the <tag>slightest</> threat.

The effective harnessing of airflow beneath the car is one of the most crucial elements in the F1 design equation. 
The CG891's chassis, designed by the highly respected Adrian Newey, was conceived to run with its underside very close to the ground, but its aerodynamics proved to be `nervous". 
It was easily disrupted by even the <tag>slightest</> bumps and undulations on the track surface.

Given this, we must recognize that knowledge of appearances is not, in itself, such a worthless thing; what we know on the basis of sense-experience is perfectly good for many purposes. 
Even if we cannot get at `the truth itself" and `be admitted into the very inner shrines of nature", we can at least `glimpse &ellip. some <tag>slight</> image of it", and `live among certain of the outer altars".

The marine specialities have the proper northern European feel: plump Danish herring fillets come with a choice of sour cream and dilled cucumber, sherry marinade, remoulade sauce or curry mayonnaise; smoked trout is spiked with horseradish, smoked cod roe garnished with smoked oysters. 
Fresh lobster, dressed with lemon mayonnaise, also turns up from time to time and though dill-pickled salmon with a mustard dressing may, thanks to Marks and Spencer, no longer count as exotica, the Howgate's version is sweet, fresh and delicate. 
But for us, the star turn in the seafood selection consisted of translucent ribbons of smoked eel, its <tag>slight</> saltiness mellowed by a layer of sour cream.

He did not make the Test team but for the next Test six months later, the opening game of the 1987 World Cup against Italy, he ousted his full-back predecessor, Kieron Crowley.

Several glanced at us. 
There was a girl in a long shirt who stared at me tiredly and held out her right hand with a <tag>slight</> movement of her wrist, palm upwards, which in Lebanon is not an appeal for alms but a gesture of despair, a way of saying `What can we do?"

Artists such as Falk (on whom Ehrenburg had modelled the character of the disinterested Saburov) were not instantly rehabilitated, but it now became possible openly to admit that they existed.

The second and more fundamental, is the ostensible cause of the damage: the poll tax itself, already established in Scotland and from yesterday also the law of the land in England and Wales. 
The full facts of the riot may take time to disentangle, but they may not in the end differ all that substantially from the testimony of one of thousands of peaceful protesters who found themselves trapped in it.

Plainly, it is this latter category that is of most interest to readers of this book. 
Because the resources of the Redundant Churches Fund are fairly <tag>slight</> related to the large number of churches which are falling into disuse, it should be equally clear that conversion is often the only way in which a creditable building can be saved from complete destruction through neglect and vandalism.

Next, in easy stages, you will need to reshape some of your  food preferences. 
We all learn to like certain tastes, certain  textures in the foods we eat. 
If you carefully plan a new  health regime that slowly introduces <tag>slight</> modifications to  your usual meals, perhaps to try different ways of cooking  food, to have slightly larger portions of vegetables and fruit,  you will eventually find that your food preferences change  slightly, enough to tip the balance from an unhealthy diet  (too high in fat and sugar, too low in fibre), to a healthy one  that will help you attain and then maintain a slim figure.

In-plane distortions are less serious than out-of-plane movement and they are commonly evidenced by sliding of panels of masonry and opening of cracks. 
Frequently, vertical loads retain a fairly clear line of support or `load path" down to the ground and the existence of even quite large cracks, although detrimental to appearance and weather resistance, need not be structurally significant. 
In structural engineer's parlance, crack widths of less than 1mm (1/16in) are termed very <tag>slight</> and those less than 5mm (3/16in) are termed `slight".

However, she still had not been fed and so she started to paw at the fence again. 
Her owner rushed to bring her a bucket of oats before she should become entangled in the fence once again.

The figures suggest, however, that the Church may have arrested its long decline in attendance. 
Church Statistics, published by the Central Board of Finance of the Church of England, reinforces the accepted figure of a church which has probably been overtaken by the Roman Catholics in terms of active membership, but which retains a large penumbra of non-believing occasional customers for weddings and baptisms. 
The 1987 figure for Easter communicants, probably the best measure of the number of serious adult believers, shows a <tag>slight</> rise to 1,606,600, from 1,550,000 the previous year.

It is not true these days. 
The sound was workmanlike and unassuming, with a vivid rhythmic functional alertness that went right down to the tiniest accompaniment figures, and an airy grace released like a sigh into the melodic lines.

BASEBALL, concerned lest it be seen to be ignoring the scale of the tragedy that has befallen hundreds of families in Northern California, has decided to postpone the resumption of the 1989 World Series by a week, with game three provisionally scheduled for Candlestick Park on Tuesday. 
Earlier, it had been suggested that all the remaining games would take place at the Oakland Coliseum, but after extensive structural analysis at Candlestick, Fay Vincent, the commissioner, announced that the Giants would not have to forego home-field advantage for the next three games.

It is a problem which seems curiously common to left-arm spinners, and manifests itself with the bowler either failing to release the ball, or propelling it vertically into the air.

I watched a man slide close behind a woman at an hors d'oeuvres table: as he came in line with her ass he smirkingly humped against it, jogging her piece of broccoli in the dip (raw broccoli had just come in that year); I was disgusted and wanted to take her in my arms and comfort her, but she looked up with only <tag>slight</> annoyance, or perhaps even with flirtatious pleasure, and laughed and said, `Pardon me, Henry!"

In her they became themselves." 
At about the time when Lewis was sitting in the candlelight at the feet of Yeats, William Kirkpatrick died, aged seventy-one. 
Lewis was stricken by the news and imagined the Great Knock confronting the Almighty with the Voltairean alexandrine, `je soupc/5onne entre nous que vous n'existez pas," or telling Aristotle (this was a real Kirkian remark which he once made) that his logic had `the distinction of never having been the <tag>slightest</> use to any human being".   

700207
`Do as he tells you." 
There was a <tag>slight</> pause.  

700208
I used to call him `the conscience of the Conservative Party"; and when, at the memorial service for him the organ played Bunyan's hymn <ignore type=deadGuys>`To Be a Pilgrim" (`Who would true valour see, / Let him come hither &ellip.")</ignore>, the tears came to my eyes. 
With Robert Stanfield, whom I admire greatly, I have only a <tag>slight</> acquaintance.

SPONSORSHIP has become the most hotly debated subject in television. 
Hardly a week passes without a major conference &dash. in the past seven days, one in London, another in Lisbon &dash. where television companies, advertisers and sponsorship consultants, a new breed, come together to divine any <tag>slight</> shift in the regulatory tea leaves. 

700210
MAC has slipped into the first division of show jumping so unobtrusively that many people in this country are unaware of her arrival. 
The tall, <tag>slight</> 26-year-old may help to spread the message when she rides Everest Oyster and Gringo in the Olympia Show Jumping Championships, which begin their five-day run today. 

700211
Partly responsible for this impression was Puttnam's `First Love" series, which revived from Melody the idea of asking young (and not-so-young) writers to chronicle their early romances. 
The <tag>slight</>, often whimsical, films that resulted were publicized as Goldcrest's research and development area but, although the `First Loves" might differentiate competent directors from the other sort, they didn't generate new ideas for movies, nor did they do much to stimulate the imaginations of those who made them.   

700212
The foal receives not only affection and security from its mother, but also acceptance. 
Mares, on the whole, are surprisingly tolerant of the roughness and rudeness of their own offspring, and rarely seem to reprimand them, and if so, then perhaps with only a <tag>slight</> nip.   

700213
But he pointed out that the Soviet Union was still spending substantially on weapons, with one new nuclear submarine launched every six weeks, and two aircraft, six tanks, and one missile produced every day. 
The Government trusted that any intention of using such weapons was <tag>slight</> under the present leadership, `but we must never forget in looking at our own defensive arrangements, the reality of the situation could change".   

700214
Whereas Mao turned to Hua Guofeng, an obscure party official, Mr Deng, too, has turned to a relatively unknown, but, he hopes, faithful protege &dash. Jiang Zemin, a former Shanghai party chief. 
But if precedent is anything to go by, Mr Jiang's chances of survival are <tag>slight</>. 

700215
There is accordingly little likelihood of a review to tighten German monetary policy early next year, for fear that a tax cut due in January and worth DM22bn to DM25bn ( #7.9bn to #9bn) will overheat the West German economy. 
Furthermore, the immediate impact on German consumption following the flood of East Germans across the border has been <tag>slight</> compared to the size of the West German economy.   

700216
`Failure to warn" has become, if anything, an even more volatile source of liability because it does not necessitate an attack on the quality of the product itself but merely on the manner of its distribution. 
Moreover, the burden of preventive measures is relatively <tag>slight</> and therefore favours liability for failure to use them.   

700217
At her clinic, Mrs Huart inserted a number of needles into the skin of his arm. 
Mr Hambleton was aware of a <tag>slight</> prick when the needles were inserted, and there was a hint of an almost indefinable sensation as Mrs Huart `stimulated" the needles by hand.   

700218
I never actually reached puberty, in terms of periods, although I can remember feeling lumps developing in my breasts, and being momentarily shocked before realising that I was growing up. 
My baby book says: `<tag>Slight</> breast development" at ten and a half years old.

All county courts have official court welfare officers, but the Birmingham scheme is independent and is perceived as such, which means that clients trust it. 
`That <tag>slight</> distance between us and the registrar is necessary," says Mr Rhodes.   

700221
In addition there are circulation routes at both ends of the space &dash. at the north end provided by a fireproof staircase and walled corridor wings. 
The stairwell repeats the grid-like windows of the central concourse and is topped by one <tag>slight</> piece of whimsy: a tiny `Juliet" balcony cut into the top-floor end-wall, which offers an excellent vantage point over the studios.

He showed some indication of a return to form last time out when fourth to Well Furnished at Kempton, with Steve Cauthen weaving his way through on the rails to make up ground but all too late to seriously trouble the leaders. 
With Ray Cochrane on board tonight the three-year-old certainly looks a good bet to get off the mark, although one must have a <tag>slight</> regard for John Gosden's previous winner Amana River, who was a beaten favourite last time out.   

700224
HRH Prince Michael of Kent resigned his non-executive directorship. 
Given the timing of the announcement, the City paid not the <tag>slightest</> bit of attention and the shares remained firmly unchanged at 277p.   

700225
In communications, too, the Soviet Union has realised it must modernise or die, whatever the risk. 
Beyond the <tag>slightest</> doubt the new technology is helping reshape politics here far more dramatically than pious talk of the `socialist market economy".   

700227
The upshot of the visit was the withdrawal of the Berlin ultimatum in favour of a conference. 
Perhaps it was to exploit this <tag>slight</> sign of thaw that Eisenhower immediately afterwards invited Khrushchev to the United States.   

700228
Mrs Mark, still twittering, had emerged again onto the terrace. 
The car came up the <tag>slight</> slope towards them and stopped about thirty yards away.   

700229
But thankfully Town secured the points that mattered to maintain their promotion challenge. 
Two drivers escaped with <tag>slight</> inujuries when their cars collided on the A.4074 near Crowmarsh.

At this point it is worth taking a step back from the scene and recalling that the Soviet Union and all the East European states are signatories to the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution. 
With the exception of Poland and Romania, they are pledged under the 1985 Protocol on Sulphur Emissions to reduce their sulphur emissions by 30 per cent by 1993. 
It is unlikely that when they signed they could ever have had the <tag>slightest</> hope of achieving such a reduction.   

700231
It was no longer a drizzle but swathes of sleet and hail blanketing the peaceful fields. 
I found my ticket after a <tag>slight</> panic, rummaging through all my pockets and spilling out a mass of debris &dash. credit cards, library ticket, video shop membership card, driving licence, etc.   

700235
M. Fourcade, in his portrait, seems to step forward dramatically into the viewer's space. 
In Monsieur Samary de la Come&acute.die Franc&cedilla.aise Lautrec showed the actor alone on stage and seen from above, as if from a box at the theatre. 
Lautrec exploited the expressive potential of the silhouette in both paintings, imparting a caricatural quality that makes his subjects appear to combine wordly, gentlemanly elegance with a <tag>slight</> ridiculousness.  

700236
He said he was hoping they would have a chance to meet before he went off to Spain as planned to start filming with Michael Caine and Joan Collins. 
There had been a <tag>slight</> hitch over one or two details in the contracts, but that was all cleared up now and any moment he might be up to his ears. 

700237
`You can't prove I didn't save it." 
Cullam gave a <tag>slight</> shiver as the overhead light flickered off, then on again. 

700238
But he indicated that New Courtaulds would have around four times the pre-tax profits and earnings of Courtaulds Textiles. 
This implies a <tag>slight</> improvement in New Courtaulds over current levels.

He's a he, for one thing, and his hopping into desolate widow Emma's bed is anything but the bloodless coup of the fairy-tale &dash. she is in it at the time. 
That's a subplot; in the main, splendidly constructed event the FBI's Agent Blue, not to be confused with agent orange, is closing in on Louise Baker, nee Leone, A Massachusetts mafiosa half-heartedly trying to retire and wholeheartedly bumping off anyone with the <tag>slightest</> degree of incriminating knowledge of her past.

Giving a racing driver's eye-view of the new circuit, Walkinshaw said: `Instead of sweeping left through Maggotts Curve and braking hard for Becketts, there is a new series of curves &dash. right, left and right &dash.  rejoining at the start of Hangar Straight. 
The key here is to minimise your loss of speed between the two straights." 
`The famous, long Hangar straight is unchanged, but Stowe is radically different: the radius of this right-hander is much tighter and you swoop down into the Vale, a significant dip followed by a <tag>slight</> rise to a left-hander &dash.  this is likely to be a good sport for overtaking &dash. before you rejoin the existing circuit at Club Corner."
