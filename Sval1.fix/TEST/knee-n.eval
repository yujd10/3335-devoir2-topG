I worried that the audience wouldn't have time to get all this if the jar opened too readily, and therefore I hoped that the percussionist would by chance encounter one of those infrequent Peter Pans or Skippy Creamies that was the product of an improperly calibrated piece of screwing machinery, so that as he struggled covertly to turn the lid, increasingly embarrassed and frustrated, his jaw clenched; his fiercely whispered `You little piece of shit!" sizzling from the loudspeaker horns, his membership in the musicians' union suddenly open to doubt, and as he fussily excused himself to go backstage and run the jar under hot water for a minute, we all might use that lucky delay to think of the meteorological greatness stored and quality-sealed in La Mer or, more likely, of times when we had undergone similar failures with jars of peanut butter (or jelly or spaghetti sauce) &dash. when we, or I at least, determined to succeed on a third attempt, pretwisted my hands and allowed the drumstick of thumb flesh on my right hand to settle over the slight tractive fluting on the edge of the lid, while the fingers of this same hand curled and clamped to its curvature, all of them leaning to one side 
, as a row of knees in a concert hall will all lean to accommodate a late-arriving ticket holder. 
Staring straight ahead, I began the twist itself: I exerted force; then greater force; then folded myself around the jar, and, shaking with extreme effort, blood booming in my eardrums, hooting spittle, gave it my personal best; hunching with it past my crotch to my <tag>knees</>.

It was that sort of night.

He had long given up hope of finding a way out of any of it. 
Now and for years, usually when she thought no one else was looking but not always, she had reminded him of it with a semi-amorous glance, a mouthed kiss, a squeeze of arm or <tag>knee</>, a caress near the edge of a sensitive area, a not very cryptic spoken hint, or, most alarmingly and awfully, in direct reference, as now.

Ludens, arriving, would have to intuit what was required. 
If Marcus, usually to be found in his bedroom, was sitting upon an upright chair, his back straight, his hands on his knees, staring into space, in a posture presumably connected with some technique of meditation, Ludens would wait outside in the hall, or converse quietly with Irina in the kitchen.

His dark pin-striped woollen suit was his uniform, the mute witness to countless terms dutifully served within the sombre walls of St Andrew's Junior School, Listerhills.

Of that hero, my great-great-grandfather, I soon determined to write what had not been written before, a biography.

I asked if, in re-reading King's works for his project, she had been surprised at what she had found.

Ezra becomes obsessed with the story and spends the rest of his life trying to verify and come to terms with it. 
In the course of his investigation, he hears other impossible tales: of a shaman whose left eye has been teased out of its socket to rest behind his ear; of a male cabaret performer whose hernia has swollen his scrotum so it hangs down to his <tag>knees</>; of Amos McKenzie, who is staked out in the jungle by Indians and watches his body return to the soil.

What I drew resembled a balled-up piece of paper. 
Finally, defeated, knowing I was cheating, I sketched a primitive pair of lungs, resembling the ones in the ad for Primatene Mist, and an arrow pointing to them that said `From a pillow"; for, as I explained to my mother, the only way to know the real nature of the inside of a pillow was to breathe in its air. 
THE BUG HERSELF never used pillows, except that time on the plane, when we put one of the miniature ones handed out by the flight attendant on my lap, under her <tag>knees</>.

I had counted for something in that town! 
But it was just as likely that the hoses had not even registered my weight: after all, the similar red rubber hoses that lay near the pumps in gas stations in those years, back when every station had an air machine, didn't; car tires made them ding every time, but only if you had just pumped up your bike's tires, and you dipped hard with your <tag>knees</> at precisely the right moment as you crossed the hose with the rear tire, lifting the front in a near wheelie, could you sometimes set the dinger off with a bicycle tire &dash. and even then the repairmen in the garage were never deceived: sometimes they didn't even look up from their idle adjustments, or they looked up with dull hostility, because they knew that dings from cars came in pairs. 

700064
What makes Cerebral Fix &dash. ex-Sounds EP stars &dash. stand out is the way they're busy twisting things around in the Death / Doom category. 
And that, in a strand of metal that's rapidly dying on its feet due to excessive plagiarism and a glut of shite bands, means they're way above almost anything the Yank corpse grinders can manage. 
This is not a <tag>knee-jerk</> Brit Death reaction, either.

Parents of children waiting in line would slip up to me, point out their child, and pay me 50 cents.

Attempts to discover whether this faith is based on a shared ideology usually end with the conclusion that he is a pragmatist rather than an ardent Thatcherite. 
His statement on his selection as the parliamentary candidate for Huntingdon, that he was `totally opposed to any policy that treats people as second-class citizens" has been widely quoted as evidence that he is not a <tag>knee-jerk</> right-winger.

He said last night: `I've had a spot of bother for the past four or five years with my knee so I had these X-rays done and they found a bone growth about the size of a pea.

What was the latest style to arrive in London, I asked three young Muslim women from Mirpur who live in a North London suburb. 
`Just now," they told me `it is the Garara (trousers which flare from just above the <tag>knee</>) and quite a short Kamiz to go with it and of course a Dupatta (a long light scarf) in georgette in an exactly matching colour".

Manchester City v Millwall Goddard, Millwall's #800,000 midweek signing, was not registered in time, and Sheringham misses his sixth game with a <tag>knee</> injury.   

700078
The undramatic origins of my particular badges, as it were, have been forgotten by everyone except myself. 
The plain truth is that I once twisted my <tag>knee</> after falling down a ridiculously narrow flight of stairs at a crowded party in a terraced house in Highgate, and I found it so comforting and indeed so peculiarly elegant to lean on a good stout walking stick during the weeks that followed this mishap that I continued to do so long after my leg had returned to normal. 

700079
The umpire simply cannnot see what is happening. 
A mouthful of mud, clapped in smartly, steadies even the most tenacious opponent, as do fingers in his eyes or up his nose. 
A <tag>knee</> behind his ear, levered by one's thigh, with hip against the wall as fulcrum, puts an intolerable strain on his neck.

Arsenal v Norwich Davis, the England midfield player limited to 11 matches last season by injuries and suspension, has `a 50-50 chance" of starting for the first time since April, according to manager George Graham. 
Norwich will be missing top scorer Fleck, who had his third <tag>knee</> operation in nine months this week, and midfielder Crook (calf injury) for the first time this season.

Mr Baughan alleged that when PC Rodger grabbed hold of Lloyd, he pulled him through a barbed wire fence and then put his right <tag>knee</> across the policeman's throat.

I understand they informed the club on Saturday morning that they would not be available." 
Carlsberg League leaders, Kingston, and second-placed Manchester Giants, had a free weekend to concentrate on preparations for tonight's NatWest Trophy final at the Royal Albert Hall, where Kingston make their fifth appearance after winning four successive National Cup finals from 1985. 
Giants are without their 6ft 8in forward, Martin Ford, who needs <tag>knee</> surgery, but Kingston's Joel Moore plays after resting the Achilles injury which cost him his England place in the European championship matches against Spain, Yugoslavia and West Germany last week.   

700084
The Eighties mania for black, for tailoring, for the short, sharp suit and lavish evening dress was nothing if not cohesive. 
When Anna Wintour swept into her office at British Vogue and decreed all skirts had to be above the <tag>knee</>, she was following an established tradition of benign dictatorship that readers seemed eager to respond to.   

700085
That evening, we sat in the square and watched as the local people bustled about while the sun went down. 
A dog chased five goats into one of the bars and little girls sat chatting on the <tag>knees</> of old men.   

700086
It came as a surprise to hear the chairs move as Maggie and Rose got to their feet. 
Moran dropped his beads slowly back into the black purse, still kneeling, and then lifted himself off his <tag>knees</>.

The last wicket to fall, that of Rumesh Ratnayake caught by Border off the bowling of Hughes, gave the Australian captain a Test match record of 123 catches from 111 games. 
In the final 35 minutes David Boon, with a runner and a <tag>knee</> injury which will put him out of action for eight weeks, square cut his first ball and was well caught in the gully. 

700089
I am going to damage you". 
He then put his right <tag>knee</> across my throat.

It eats away the wife's confidence and belief in her husband. 
It leads to wild pain-driven and shaming swipes at the outer world: `You should stick to the slums and the people who live in them," she rages to the social worker, as her liberal exterior cracks, `God, listen to that!" 
Beside better insights like that, it looks too easy to make jabs at brusque professional carers for <tag>knee-jerk</> diagnosis, or the crass insensitivity of serving a place of safety order in a crowded waiting room.

Greg Hutchings of Tomkins could conceivably be one of the aspirants for the throne, though not if the stock market continues to look with such scepticism at his story so far. 
Mr Hutchings learned his trade at Lord Hanson's <tag>knee</> &dash. or rather in his acquisitions team.

John Rowlands's search ended with the discovery of his surviving grandfather, a `severe and sour old man" who lived with two of Rowlands's aunts in an old Welsh farmhouse. 
He found him, stout and pink, in a brown suit, <tag>knee-breeches</>, and blue-grey stockings, sitting in the farm kitchen on the wooden settle by the fire, smoking a long clay pipe. 

700095
But Coventry's pride is equally piqued after they stumbled into a televised dead end against Nottingham Forest in the Littlewoods Cup last week. 
Villa manager Graham Taylor is keeping faith with the side beaten by Wimbledon, but Coventry add reserve goalkeeper Keith Waugh and central defender Peter Billing to their squad in case Steve Ogrizovic (calf muscle injury) and Brian Kilcline (twisted <tag>knee</>) fail late fitness checks.  

700096
Using their local knowledge, Team Costa Rica and Team Cafe Britt raced ahead of the other 33 teams over Chirripo. 
Using ski poles to take some weight off his <tag>knees</>, operated on only eight weeks before, 53-year-old Nathaniel Grew led Team Costa Rica into the tiny village of St Gerrardo. 

700097
Toshack introduced the swift, if erratic, Paco Llorente for Martin Vazquez, but initially Milan's control was undisturbed and they should have extended their aggregate lead when Van Basten picked out Angelo Colombo; as the defence melted away, giving him time to pull the ball down and shoot, he headed high over. 
Real were a team in need of a turning point and their frenzied fans thought one had come when, after Mauro Tassotti had been cautioned for elbowing Butragueno, the ball rattled around the goalmouth, came back off a post, and was headed over the line by the Spanish striker while he was on his hands and <tag>knees</>; suspicions of offside did not extend to the referee.

We can meet these demands, but we need a work norm which enables men to spend more time with their children and their elderly relatives; which enables women to combine work and family responsibilities without feeling torn in two. 
The Government is incapable of responding because it has a <tag>knee-jerk</> rejection of demands from the shopfloor and is simply out of touch with people's aspirations of the quality of their lives.

This was an uplifting experience &dash. as Haydn intended it should be. 
10 October, 1903 RAYMOND ASQUITH writes to Lady Manners from Aberdeenshire: `We had a storm yesterday and went out to watch the waves: I ventured too far out onto a rock and was knocked flat on my face against a granite floor by one of the biggest rollers ever seen on this coast: I never felt such a blow; luckily I fell in a crevice and wasn't washed away; but I was stunned for a few seconds, and when I got up my face and <tag>knee</> were streaming with blood.

It was very evenly balanced with the Dutch, and we'll just have to reverse the result." 
He claimed England would be stronger having introduced `one or two very good young players" (Des Walker will certainly stiffen the defence thrice breached by Marco Van Basten) and conceded that a failure by Ruud Gullit to recover from <tag>knee</> surgery `would obviously be better for us", if not the World Cup as a whole.

The people on the streets of Leipzig demand in one voice liberty and the reunification of their nation.

The women's championship will be decided between the South African exile Wendy Botha, who lives in Sydney, and two of her neighbours, Pauline Menczer and Pam Burridge, the statuesque 24-year-old model. 
Botha dislocated her <tag>knee</> in Australia a few weeks ago but such is her tenacity, that if she can walk, she should win her second world title.

For the grandchildren of the Cornish Earl of St Germans, house and family memory combined to give an unforgettable magic to their long seaside summer and autumn visits to Port Eliot. 
`We had our own large suite of nurseries in which to play", wrote one of the earl's granddaughters, from which, when there were big evening dinners, the children would `creep down the back staircase" to be fed with sausages, turkey, ice-cream, and nuts in the `comfortable sanctum" of the housekeeper. 
The earl himself `we children all loved", remembering that their peculiar delight `as a small child was to sit on his <tag>knee</> and inspect his watch, which could open and shut, and chief novelty of all in my eyes, could chime!"

I NOTE from a front-page lead story in the Southern Star (incorporating the Skibbereen Eagle) that a Bandon member of the Southern Committee is upset at not having been invited to the official opening of the Midleton Sewerage Scheme, in spite of its having been `deemed worthy of attendance by a Minister of State".

The US trade figures, which showed a wider than expected deficit of $10.24billion against expectations of some $9billion, threw a spanner into the works, and consequently the leaders on the FTSE index, in a <tag>knee-jerk</> reaction, lost points.

Only in the sense (as I would have to explain at defensive length in the program notes) that the daintily vortical second movement of La Mer was program music: and indeed the sound of the air entering the peanut butter jar was meant lovingly to sum up Debussy's lifelong fascination with air &dash. his interest in a technique of piano pedaling that would approximate breathing; his wish for a music whose harmonic progressions, although they might sound stifled in the concert hall, would once out of doors enter into a collaboration with the open air and float joyfully over the tops of the trees; his piano preludes, whose titles (`Voiles," `Le Vent dans la plaine," `Les sons et les parfums tournent dans l'air du soir," `Ce qu'a vu le vent d'ouest," `Brouillards," and so on) repeatedly made aerial references; the recollections by Gabriel Pierne&acute. and Camille Bellaigue that his piano technique was accompanied by his `puffing noisily during the difficult passages" and by `a kind of hiccup or harsh puff" to mark the beginning of every bar. 
I worried that the audience wouldn't have time to get all this if the jar opened too readily, and therefore I hoped that the percussionist would by chance encounter one of those infrequent Peter Pans or Skippy Creamies that was the product of an improperly calibrated piece of screwing machinery, so that as he struggled covertly to turn the lid, increasingly embarrassed and frustrated, his jaw clenched; his fiercely whispered `You little piece of shit!" sizzling from the loudspeaker horns, his membership in the musicians' union suddenly open to doubt, and as he fussily excused himself to go backstage and run the jar under hot water for a minute, we all might use that lucky delay to think of the meteorological greatness stored and quality-sealed in La Mer or, more likely, of times when we had undergone similar failures with jars of peanut butter (or jelly or spaghetti sauce) &dash. when we, or I at least, determined to succeed on a third attempt, pretwisted my hands and allowed the drumstick of thumb flesh on my right hand to settle over the slight tractive fluting on the edge of the lid, while the fingers of this same hand curled and clamped to its curvature, all of them leaning to one side

The rivalry was exemplified by Gala's hooker, Ian Corcoran, whose accurate throwing and aggression in the loose will make him a threat to Kenny Milne when Scotland's trial teams are chosen this weekend.

It was a bore that Dora could neither swim nor drive the tractor, since this meant that the bell could not be given an extra helping hand from below while it was being pulled from above.

Roman Prose is trained by Gerald Cottrell, who also has the current 8-1 favourite Gallant Hope. 
Unraced as a two-year-old because of an accident in which he damaged his <tag>knees</>, Roman Prose landed one of last season's most spectacular gambles on his racecourse debut, when he was backed from 33-1 to tens at Folkestone, before going on to land the Portland Handicap at Doncaster under the big weight for a three-year-old of 9st 3lb.

Only a complete media illiterate could leap to such a conclusion. 
Just because we appear to be gorging ourselves on war coverage doesn't mean to say that we swallow it whole.

He frowned and took huge breaths just as Art Glasheen and Jim Heydemann and I had, but the outcome &dash. a droned blast of a tune that sounded like `The Ants Go Marching Two by Two" was far more impressive than our two-minute breath-holding; and sometimes he took his mouth from the instrument and shouted `Yee-haw!" and yet because of the reserves of air in the third lung of the bagpipe itself that he squeezed under his elbow, the piping continued in full force. 
The next day I told my father I had to learn the bagpipes; he said that I might want to `build my wind" by starting out on the French horn, and he told me about Dennis Brain, the virtuoso of the Mozart concerti who was killed in a car accident at the height of his powers. 
The name Brain appealed to me, so I rented a public-school horn to prepare myself for the bagpipes, and as a result nine years later, a freshman at Eastman, I was still playing it, still performing feats of oxygen deprivation, in order to prepare a Chiarnovsky e&acute.tude that Mal Green capriciously thought ought to be done in a single breath; yet this time it was harder, of course, because all evidence of strain was forbidden: and at the next lesson, as I took a long covert breath and began playing from memory, staring at the dangling pencil, and made it past the place where Mal had erased the breath comma, I thought of those public-TV ballet specials at the end of which you saw the dancers happily bowing and smiling and gesturing archly to each other in tribute, but then you noticed when you looked more carefully that their little starved stomachs were madly inhaling under their swan feathers, rabbit-panting, and you realized in a burst of pity for squandered lives of physical practice that all they really wanted to do was to take big replenishing gasps and stand bent over with their hands on their <tag>knees</>, shaking their heads and saying, `Whoo! &dash. man oh man am I

It was not even close. 
Directing most of his offense to wherever the Giants' feared linebacker Lawrence Taylor was not, the Rams quarterback Jim Everett completed 23 passes in a 31-6 walkover.

Another Pakistani, Zarak Jahan Khan, who was carried off with torn <tag>knee</> ligaments against Bryan Beeson on Monday, is likely to be out of the game for six to 12 months.

`In order to demonstrate to you the incredible kinetic potential which is locked up here in this ordinary brassiere elastic, I will now let go of my end and Miss Devine will take the full force of the recoil in her face." 
Jo clutched her heart in shock, rolled her eyes furiously, squeaked in terror and made her <tag>knees</> knock.   

700201
Her entry was so rapid that she had time to witness a little of the previous scene before its participants realised it had come to an end. 
Michael was sitting in a chair, leaning well forward, his elbows on his knees, his two hands extended. 
Toby was sitting on the floor just in front of him, one leg curled under, the other crooked up at the <tag>knee</>.   

700202
A large hand smacked into his mouth and although he bit at it the thumb was forced like a gag between his teeth. 
`Good boy," the big man kept saying as he forced him down on to his <tag>knees</>.   

700203
For one thing the town tart, who wears midnight blue camiknickers in bed and bubbles in the bath, has taken to attending the pastor's sermons wearing a lace collar and a large smile. 
She also sits on his <tag>knee</>, though not during the sermon, of course.   

700205
Midfielder Briley is still absent, injured. 
Williams, after a <tag>knee</> injury, and Kennedy, after a three match suspension, return for Luton, but Harford is missing again and may need a third operation on his troublesome ankle.  

700206
Which should ensure that, however hard this afternoon's Twickenham tour farewell, at least the preliminaries will maintain their decorum. 
No one should, or for that matter does, expect David Sole's Baa-Baas (who yesterday lost Craig Chalmers with a twisted <tag>knee</>; his replacement is the Welsh stand-off Anthony Clement) to pretend it is Christmas at Leicester or Easter at Cardiff.   

700207
Shout it out loud, you can be proud!" 
I marked time in my plimsolls, <tag>knees</> rising as my father's brogues tramped on the coconut matting.  

700208
Getting out, he tossed the cap on the seat, wrestled off the uniform, exposing the lightweight dark suit he wore under it. 
While Buckmaster sat impatiently in the rear and drummed his fingers on his <tag>knee</>, Morgan put on an expensive black overcoat, the collar trimmed with astrakhan, buttoned it up, got back behind the wheel and resumed driving.   

700209
Mick McCarthy has pulled out of the Republic of Ireland squad to play Malta on 15 November. 
The Olympique Lyon defender requires an operation on an injured <tag>knee</>. 

700210
I don't understand why the market is so volatile. 
Every piece of news seems to produce a <tag>knee-jerk</> reaction.   

700211
We can go a bit further with the analysis, and look  at what sort of young girl she is depicting. 
Well, the girl in  the drawing is, to say the least, not very conventionally sexual,  what with the tiny breasts, demure dress, big feet, those <tag>knees</>  and rather daffy expression.  

700212
The official justification is that in Bali the company could work with local performers and learn to `shift our centres of gravity away from the head, down into the centres of our bodies". 
On stage this is translated into the uncomfortable standing squat familiar from karate movies: <tag>knees</> splayed and bottom out. 

700213
Trickle along and then push me out." 
Crocker rolled himself into a ball, his arms around his <tag>knees</>.   

700214
Trowark style is large, enveloping and extremely cosy with an almost indestructible quality &dash. one five-year-old jumper seen by The Independent is only just beginning to look `broken in" after years of frequent machine washing and hard wear. 
Only medium and large sizes are made in these real men's jumpers, but the large linen shirt makes a wonderful tunic for a woman of average size and will probably keep her <tag>knees</> nice and warm.   

700215
I wish I'd hidden the bits &dash. I feel silly ripping it up for nothing. 
She squats down in front of me and puts her elbows on my <tag>knees</>.   

700216
Novelist, diarist, playwright and essayist, the French-born American writer published his 16th novel, Les Etoiles du Sud, last May and is presently preparing the 14th volume of his celebrated Journal. 
Sitting in his shaded, elegant salon, spruce in a dark suit, scarf, white shirt and tie, a tartan rug over his <tag>knees</>, Green speaks quietly and modestly.   

700217
Everton hope to have Watson back in defence after hamstring trouble. 
Nevin is doubtful because of a <tag>knee</> injury and Beagrie stands by.   

700219
Anyway, Rene&acute. said you were bound to come this way." 
She lit a cigarette and crossed one silken <tag>knee</> over the other, elegant as always in a black suit, a diamond brooch at the neck of the white silk blouse. 

700220
That will do, sir!" 
As a pedestrian, however Shaw was still supremely noticeable as he sailed by in his <tag>knee</> breeches and Norfolk jacket for walks of up to six miles.   

700221
Becker and Graf won Wimbledon and the US Open and did not get their pictures on the front cover of any non-tennis magazines here." 
Becker's photograph was in the German newspapers yesterday, accompanied by lamentations about his physical condition after a <tag>knee</> injury had caused him to abandon the Classic on Thursday.   

700222
`Hurry!" came the weak cry. 
The Russian struggled back the way he had come, scrambling on hands and <tag>knees</> in case he should reach the edge without realising it.   

700223
MacColl's more traditional repertoire was also very far from jolly. 
The Border Ballads, some of which he seems to have learned, quite literally, at his mother's <tag>knee</> (a memorable record contrasts the compelling simplicity of her keening with his own more dramatic delivery), were among his favourites. 

700224
In common with just about everyone, I knew all about it, but I had never actually seen it from below until BBC2's Late Show asked me to be one of the five designers to come up with ideas for Spaghetti Junction for a programme to be screened tonight. 
Like most people when first confronted by the vast structure from beneath, I was both impressed and horrified by its monstrous size and the huge urban desert it occupied. 
I experienced the designers" <tag>knee-jerk</> reaction and immediately thought of schemes to hide it, bury it or build on top of it &dash. anything to make it go away.   

700225
The children told me they had the day off because it was a Baker Day. 
The photographer, who snaps youngsters sitting on my <tag>knee</>, tells me that Baker Days are named after Kenneth Baker, who, as Education Secretary, introduced termly training sessions for teachers.   

700227
The horse has got to win to pay my phone bill," added Jarvis. 
The race against time to get Contract Law, who broke a bone in a <tag>knee</> last season, fit to run in the 2,000 Guineas failed and the colt is still not ready to run although he is now working very well. 

700228
This speeding sadist beside me was actually sliding this suicide cylinder of mine smoothly down the pit-lane and, Jesus, Mary and Joseph, merciful trio, we were actually stopping. 
Kindly, good-egg Nigel clapped a hand to my <tag>knee</> and said: `All right, you can open your eyes now."   

700229
The 29-year-old will link up with another new defensive signing, the Dane Kent Nielsen, for whom Taylor paid the Danish champions Brondby #500,000. 
McGrath, plagued by <tag>knee</> injuries which required six operations during his time at Old Trafford, said: `I needed a fresh start and Aston Villa have provided it." 

700230
Up there with him was Mr J. H. Thomas (Engine Driver) and Mr Philip Snowden, who has I believe a statue in Bradford. 
All of them members of the Labour party, they had donned court dress (black velvet breeches gartered above nice black stockings, and a hat) and had kissed hands to become the Government. 
As De Kuyper pointed out to me in fairness while telling the story, the black stockings worn by the Labour cabinet came only to the gartered <tag>knee</>. 

700231
Again and again he saw Brian Everthorpe's heaving buttocks, Shirley's splayed 
white <tag>knees</>, her red lips rounded in that O of pleasure, her long painted nails digging into Everthorpe's shoulders so hard Vic could see the indentations &dash. though it was difficult in retrospect to distinguish what he had witnessed from what his overheated imagination had reconstructed.   

700233
It will be another year before he will know if he will be able to play again. 
His fate now lies in the hands of Jean and Joy, who are taking him through the painstaking and often painful series of exercises needed to coax his <tag>knee</> into flexing again.   

700234
When she found the door she knocked and bounded in without further ceremony. 
Her entry was so rapid that she had time to witness a little of the previous scene before its participants realised it had come to an end. 
Michael was sitting in a chair, leaning well forward, his elbows on his <tag>knees</>, his two hands extended. 

700235
before putting on their shoes. 
The editors, on their <tag>knees</>, began pinning, tweaking, and taping the dresses to hang correctly for the next shot.   

700237
He was standing in a pool of blood and water and behind him a line of bloody footprints marked his painful progress from the showers. 
Below his <tag>knees</>, his blue pyjama trousers were blotched with crimson.   

700238
His confident, curving serve whistled over the net into the far corner of the court, leaving Murray to lunge futilely in its direction. 
`Get off your <tag>knees</>, Toady!   

700239
She's tried alternative therapies such as acupuncture and osteopathy, but to no avail, and has just started another, Alexander Technique, but it's too soon to says whether it will help, she says. 
Jane does not know where her back pain stems from, but says it could have been triggered by a car accident 16 years ago, when she was 18. 
`None of us were hurt, and I thought the only damage was a bruise on the <tag>knee</>," she remembers.   

700240
The dogs began to growl as Frankie turned the knob of amber glass with both hands and pushed the door open. 
Sweetheart was sitting in her favourite chair with her legs crossed at the <tag>knee</> and a magazine spread out on the table before her.   

700241
Ann finished a very creditable fourth in the 56 kilo class but the real achievement was her behind-the-scenes battle to compete. 
Last September the Bicester lifter suffered an injured knee and eventually went to Oxford United physiotherapist John Clinkard for treatment. 
The <tag>knee</> responded well to treatment but just three weeks before the championships Ann went down with pleurisy and it looked as if her hopes of competing in Manchester had disappeared.   

700242
`I swear that woman has been `appearing" to me today," Jean said. 
`I mean, it's hardly possible that a human being can vanish from sight in front of your eyes &dash. in swirling traffic &dash. just dematerialize, like that!" There was no possibility that Jean Hastie had been drinking before taking some of the punch, Robina said. 
She was stone-cold sober &dash. so cold, in fact, that a hot-water bottle had been placed on her feet and a warm plaid on her <tag>knees</>.   

700243
But where was all the switchgear? 
The column stalks are fine: indicators, lights and horn on the left, wipers on the right. 
But the hazard warnings, rear fog lights and rear screen demister are an arm's length away, obscured by the steering wheel, while the switch for the front fogs is hidden above my right <tag>knee</>.   

700244
Last night Lendl had little difficulty in defeating John McEnroe 6-4, 6-4 at the conclusion of the round robin phase. 
A degree of surprise was expressed when McEnroe showed up here after a <tag>knee</> injury had forced his withdrawal from last month's grand prix event in San Francisco.   

700245
Local stewards can now give them a 10-14 day suspension the same day.

700246
PC Boyd Rodger collapsed after a car and foot chase along roads and an unfinished motorway, through a construction site and woodland and across a field, Oxford Crown Court was told yesterday. 
At one point, PC Rodger thought he was going to be strangled when Lloyd put his <tag>knee</> on the policeman's throat.   

700247
This is now widely accepted, but Mr. X, strangely, never pursued it further with reference to the anatomy of the individual golfer. 
I have a very observant Afrikaans friend, a medical doctor, also a great admirer of Mr. X, who maintains that all top-class golfers walk on the insides of their feet, thus enabling them to maintain the right shin post without effort, as against the bandy-legged player, who finds it very difficult to keep his right <tag>knee</> firm on the backswing.   

700248
Since they beat the World Cup holders in the opening game, it would be unwise now to regard Cameroon as soft touches, but with their opponents due to be drawn from one of the third-placed teams, Scotland possibly, this part of the tournament is beginning to look like a back double towards the semi-finals. 
If England come second in Group F their opponents will be Romania, the Group B runners-up, in Genoa on Monday. 
Cameroon have five days to regain the confidence and audacity which stunned Argentina in Milan and had Romania on their <tag>knees</> in Bari.   

700249
Magnet's bankers were unable to persuade other banks to syndicate their debt, and now they are left holding a rather unwanted baby. 
Other deals, such as Isosceles' purchase of Gateway Corporation and the buyout of Alders from Hanson, have left the buyers with a mountain of debt and an exposure to a weakening retail market. 
But although it is widely recognised that retailers are having a tough time, the downturn in consumer demand is not in itself enough to bring a retailer to its <tag>knees</>. 

700250
Then, on jelly-like legs, we begin the once longed-for descent. 
As always, it rapidly becomes more of a <tag>knee-jerking</> ordeal for aching limbs than we could possibly have imagined as we inched our way up.   

700252
IGNORE the disputing ambulancemen at your peril, especially if &dash. like North Hertfordshire's left-back, Andrew Meldrum &dash. you are lying in agony on a football field, waiting vainly for expert medical help, writes Philip James. 
The ESFA Inter-Association Trophy tie against West Suffolk was 10 minutes old when 15-year-old Meldrum turned awkwardly and badly dislocated a <tag>knee-cap</>.   

700254
The wounds, in some instances, may take time to heal, which means that Ireland will be anxiously awaiting fitness reports before Saturday's Dublin international. 
In the first half, it was Michael Kiernan who was led from the battlefield nursing a damaged shoulder, and towards the finish, Donal Lenihan had received attention for a <tag>knee</> injury.   

700255
She and Guise were married two months later, a testament to the aphrodisiac qualities of too much fresh air. 
So far there has been only one accident: Paul Borthwick, a 35-year-old London-based civil servant who runs to work, tripped and fell while on the coast-to-coast special ('We chose that programme because it didn't have the day off') and had to have stitches in his <tag>knee</>.   

700256
NEW Zealand's captain Wayne Shelford was a shock omission from the All Black team to play Australia in the first rugby union Test on Saturday week. 
New Zealand chairman Eddie Tonks said Shelford was not considered because of a `niggling <tag>knee</> injury" but Shelford played for his North Harbour union on Wednesday.  

700257
Frankie was shivering. 
He was wearing only a sleeveless vest and a pair of short pants that reached almost to his bony <tag>knees</>.   

700258
Millar, no lover of crowds in towns or country, sat alone, concentrating, preparing. 
The cruelly fierce Col du Tourmalet, the first climb of the afternoon, was on his mind and, sure enough, it was the 30-year-old Glaswegian who attacked it first, accompanied by Switzerland's Pascal Richard and Charlie Mottet of France. 
The peloton let them go, a peloton minus Ireland's Stephen Roche who pulled out overnight, having aggravated his bad left <tag>knee</> the previous day, losing 14 minutes.   

700259
As counting continued in several crucial constituencies, the only thing Mr Gandhi could be sure of was his own parliamentary seat. 
He was cruising to a comfortable victory in Amethi over Mahatma Gandhi's grandson, Rajmohan, but elsewhere in northern India his party was brought to its <tag>knees</>.   

700260
All is possible in football." 
Coventry are likely to be without three regular players: Brian Kilcline, the captain and centre-half who is still suffering from a leg injury, midfielder Dean Emerson (<tag>knee</>), and Micky Gynn (bruised shoulder). 

700261
Later he founded boys' clubs, where his greatest pleasure was to sit, clad in shorts, singing `Under the Spreading Chestnut Tree". 
This stirring song with lines such as `There I held you on my <tag>knee</> &ellip 

700262
Andrew, who was about to play top league amateur football with Bicester, was stretchered off with a knee injury playing for Old Woodstock just under a year ago. 
The 20-year-old midfielder hasn't played since, as a cartilage operation did not prevent his tearing a ligament in the same knee just before Christmas. 
Now he can walk only on crutches, recovering from a major operation to reconstruct his right <tag>knee</>.   

700263
But he did it without knowing why he wanted to and without knowing why he was glad his mother was out on the well-stones, unable to see him now. 
Curled up in bed that night with his <tag>knees</> almost touching his chin he heard the wireless song again, drifting up the stairs, bass notes exaggerated into a monotonous thump, thump. 

700264
Getting no joy from the opposition, the morons turned on their own captain, Peter Nicholas. 
They booed the Welshman's every contact with the ball, cheered when he sustained the serious <tag>knee</> injury which forced him off, and will presumably react with the same callousness if today's visit to a specialist confirms that he needs a cartilage operation. 

700265
`This is just the kind of project we hope girls will be interested in," she says. 
Middlesbrough winger Alan Comfort ruled out for rest of season by <tag>knee</> injury.   

700266
Hare tried to raise his arms, but suddenly found it almost impossible to breathe. 
He keeled over and Edge raised a knee in his face. 
Genevieve grabbed him by the jacket from the rear and Edge cursed and struck out at her as Hare fell to his <tag>knees</>.   

700268
From a standing position on four stiff legs he shot straight up into the sky, carrying his manacles with him. 
Up and down he sprang as if batted from the ground by some giant tennis racket and, as he turned, I saw that, though his front was as fearsome as the legendary Cerberus, his rear end wore the breeches of a 16th-century gent that puffed to the <tag>knee</> and revealed, below, a ridiculously fine pair of ankles. 

700269
The net result (about which the two makers would agree) is that the Look will release in circumstances where the Salomon will not. 
What they disagree about is whether this is a good or a bad thing: Salomon talk about the risk of head injuries from directly backward falls where the binding releases; Look talk about prevention of the <tag>knee</> injuries that can result if it does not.  

700270
The tone drew a sharp glance from Moran but he did not intercept the prayers. 
He waited until he had risen from his <tag>knees</> to say, `That was a peculiar way you had of giving out your Decade."   

700271
`And these are my breasts," she said, in a tone of gentle assurance, wisdom, resignation &dash. as if to imply that, yes, she was aware that she was uncoyly allowing our eyes a long, scorchingly frank look at them, allowing us even to see the spotlit lymphatic structures beneath, because once they were presented to us in this saintly, unfurtive way, in our formative years, all misplaced lusts and irresponsible pregnancies and destructive infidelity would disappear from the world. 
The Camp Fire Girls filed out; I hovered, but I was too aware of a museum staff person waiting outside to try to touch TAM's <tag>knee</>. 

700272
Terry Eagleton, however, still backs it wholeheartedly. 
Commenting that `the old implicit consensus is buckling at the <tag>knees</>", he also feels that the ground was never adequately prepared at Oxford for recent advances in critical theory (`Never mind Lacan," he says, `Oxford had not yet adjusted to Leavis") and fears that if critical theory is only offered as an option, it is in danger `of being shunted into a siding alongside Medieval Welsh".   

700273
The door is locked yet she tries turning the black iron knob in every direction. 
She walks around to find that the side door is also locked, and then, attempting to climb the pebble wall in order to look in the window, she loses her grip halfway and grazes her <tag>knee</>.  

700274
This is where the more ominous side of the new power emerges. 
A poster containing an unflattering depiction of Mrs Thatcher, with the caption, `On your <tag>knees</> to Madam M" has led to a prosecution under section 5.   

700275
Anthrobus, taken off against Luton, may be rested with Stephenson called up for the first time this season.

`Wait there!" said Rush. 
The detective sank to his <tag>knees</>.   

700279
Condon speculated that he had a kangaroo pouch inside his mouth to contain the gum while he played. 
The sight of him on the bandstand, cornet propped on his <tag>knee</> and chewing away lustily, was as unforgettable as his sideways embouchure, created as a result of a bad setback in Milwaukee during the Thirties.   

700280
`You will stay where you are, Fra&umlaut.ulein." 
His two men covered them with the machine pistols and Sturm walked the length of the room and dropped to one <tag>knee</> beside Julie.
