They have a music biz ring through their noses: the last rock <tag>band</>.

On September 27, 1986, there appeared an interview with Morrissey conducted by fellow Mancunian, Frank Owen. 
Now Owen shared a similar cultural background to Morrissey &dash. he used to hang around the same clubs, he was singer with the post punk <tag>band</> Manicured Noise, a band often linked with Morrissey's beloved Ludus, and the feature was a fascinating if bewildering jumble of nostalgic bonhomie. 

700003
It was shortly after this that he told me all about the rehearsals he was involved in in London and his involvement with Dominic Muldowney and Louis Marks making the production of the Bertholt Brecht play Baal and I remember he wanted to record it as a souvenir and said that it was not going to be any big deal and probably wouldn't sell, but felt it should be recorded for posterity. 
We had long meetings with Dominic which was the first time that I had ever worked with a serious composer and I remember going to see Dominic at the South Bank Complex and going round many winding rooms and hearing the operatic rehearsals and was very impressed. 
On the television programme, the music was very simply scored for a few instruments and banjo, but we wanted to record it actually in Berlin in the style of Bertholt Brecht using a typical German pit <tag>band</> or, in other words, a small orchestra comprising of one of each instrument &dash. one violin, one viola, one trumpet, one accordion &dash. and that was the way we approached it.   

700004
By the evening of July 20 nearly a quarter of the distance had been covered, crowds had gathered every day to watch progress, and on the previous Sunday the number of visitors was estimated to be between 1,000 and 1,500, so it was not surprising that <ignore type=deadGuys>every drop of liquor in Mr Simmonds' house was consumed.</ignore> Throughout the following week the crowds continued; Miss Richards was suffering severely from the hot weather, but her pace was still good although 
However, she recovered from the excessive heat, and on August 12 it was reported that the grass plot, round which she walked twenty-two times to complete a mile, was now a beaten track like a permanent path. 
And so the marathon walk continued until it was successfully concluded on the evening of Monday, August 21, but before that ultimate triumph Miss Richards toured the city in an open brake drawn by three horses, attired in her walking costume and accompanied by a brass <tag>band</>, acknowledging gracefully the plaudits of those who thronged the streets.

Mr Sunderland himself had driven her home in his car, and she had begged him to leave her at the gate so as not to alarm her family.

This did not confuse the fans, who were immediately familiar with the material, providing word-perfect singalongs to new lyrics like `It's OK, baby, it's OK". 
At the end of this intrusion, Rossi told us that was enough new stuff (big cheer) because he had to think about it `And thinking doesn't go with this <tag>band</>, does it?"

When he came out he worked briefly with Art Hodes and then led his own band in St Louis before moving into Condon's Club in New York in December 1945. 
After that he had star status and played mainly as a guest with other bands. 
When he first visited London with Condon's <tag>band</> in 1957 Bill was `drinking two bottles of Scotch a day and whatever anyone else forced on me". 

700013
This was backed up by the famous John Peel Festive Fifty which was embarrassingly dominated by the band. 
Melody Maker hid a definite nod of acceptance behind a peppering of harmless insults. 
The glossies followed suit, dutifully documenting the <tag>band's</> progress and blindly including this strange bunch of yokels among the smiling blonds beautiful masses.

Sir Anthony Meyer's self-destructive challenge to the leadership of Margaret Thatcher cost him the support of his constituency party early in 1990, but, like Sir Ian Gilmour, he was merely symptomatic of a cast of mind common to many of the baronetcy.

`No comment." 
Mancunian freelance music writer Ro Newton: `The fans of The Smiths seem to be in the foreground before the <tag>band</> themselves.

Andrew Newton describes the years of hassle with Mr Casson as being like a trip down Amnesia Lane. 
`The whole point of forming the British Council was that he was running FESH as a one-man <tag>band</> with him making decisions without consulting the members," Mr Newton said.  

700017
All this is the sadder because, as Howard Davies's finely-acted, in-the-round production demonstrates, the play endorses, for the most part, the view that responsibility for their own advancement is something even the most oppressed minority has no right to shelve. 
In the desultory conversations among the <tag>band</>, for example, there is a refreshing lack of piety.   

700018
The train came puffing in. 
The fucking <tag>band</> struck up `God Save the King".

To add to the confusion, a month later, Rourke rejoined and the new, hard, heavy, five-piece Smiths were born. 
Then there was yet another dispute between the <tag>band</> and Rough Trade supremo, Geoff Travis.

When she'd drunk that, Nevil proposed they danced again, and she agreed. 
Now she knew beyond any doubt that they were going to spend the rest of the evening together. 
`Whheeccchhhh!" shouted a female voice as the <tag>band</> robustly played the Gay Gordons, announced as the last dance.

Towards the end of the concert the trumpet and trombone sections left the stage &dash. only to dramatically reappear moments later in the stalls and circle to play back to the rest of the orchestra on stage. 
The <tag>band</> earned a standing ovation from the packed audience and returned for an encore of the Glenn Miller Orchestra theme tune &dash. Moonlight Serenade &dash. perfectly bringing the past to life and making it a nostalgic night to remember. 

700023
The independent ethic they had courted so successfully since their conception was beginning to fall hopelessly apart. 
As The Smiths grew in commercial stature, so they encountered more and more professional people, especially in America, and these people constantly told the <tag>band</> to think big, to think mega, to evolve into a major international unit.   

700024
By the age of 14 he was earning money playing for the Dick Denny Band at the Edinburgh Palais de Danse. 
Fellow trumpet-player Ken Rattenbury, then in the army in Edinburgh, remembers, `Even then (Freddie) was a virtuoso, with a fleet, puissant way of playing that marked him out from the rest." 
When the George Elrick <tag>band</> visited Edinburgh in 1942 it collected Freddie and he travelled with the band when it returned to London.

But perhaps the best is still to come. 
Captain Gooch joined a select <tag>band</> of England batsmen yesterday by reaching 5,000 Test runs during his magnificent unbeaten 95 which lit up the deciding Cornhill clash against New Zealand at Edgbaston. 

700026
Indeed, the tradition of choirs dressed in stiff white surplices and sitting in the chancel only came in with the Oxford Movement last century. 
Before that, churches had relied on gallery <tag>bands</> for their music &dash. anarchic and ad hoc groups of musicians, bowing or blowing any instrument to hand from their position in the gallery at the back of the church.

So perhaps the opening night was a good guide to Cheltenham 1990. 
The Consort of London, a spirited <tag>band</>, offered not a note of contemporary music to a well-filled house at the Town Hall.   

700028
The scramble for perfect vinyl ambience has forced record companies into sending their spotty new acts into the most highly sophisticated `digital" recording studios in the country. 
A producer is chosen to mould the natural sound of the band into a new format, and the mesmerised band wander out of the studio clutching a product bearing little or no resemblance to the demo they went in with. 
As the battle for successs is so brutal, the <tag>band</> rarely complain. 

700029
And he didn't. 
Hall was born in Peckham in 1898 and was doubly blessed professionally to begin his career in the Twenties, at the start of the golden age of radio, when big dance <tag>bands</> were at the height of their popularity.

Scores more from the old mining communities which straggle down the valley from Hirwaun, the site of the only colliery still in production, to Abercynon where the Lady Windsor pit closed recently, were involved. 
Stories were unearthed, local characters lined up for interview, <tag>bands</> and choirs booked.

Peter Roebuck happens to be here in his capacity as a reporter for The Sunday Times, but does not qualify.

If David gives them a cue, they don't take a cue from David, {typo bad="thsy",good="they"} take the cue from me. 
If David cues me and I don't cue the band, then the band doesn't hit and then David will look at me and say, `Carlos, what are you doing?" 
But the <tag>band</> usually doesn't have to take any fall and it's been this way for a long time. 

700036
Pushing to one side the politics of the issue &dash. far too much, in today's musical climate, to expect a song about that &dash. humanitarian gesture son? 
Make a comment on stage even, for Christ's sake, about how sad it is that we're staring down the barrel of a gun at a fuck of a lot of young corpses, widowed wives and fatherless children? 
If it's something to do with music reflecting society's tends rather than being the voice of treason, then can we rightly assume that most <tag>bands</> of the last ten years have been pro-Thatcher?   

700037
Instead she nominated some the sexiest men in the  entertainment world. 
`The guys I would like to work with  would be Mel Gibson or Michael Hutchence from the Australian  <tag>band</> INXS.

It wasn't designed to attract new listeners, however, for Morrissey's lyric remained both maudlin and frivolous. 
The single sleeve followed in the <tag>band's</> finer traditions by featuring the great Truman Capote, as captured by the lens of Cecil Beaton.   

700039
The album doesn't really live up to the promise of the single, Every Beat of the Heart, an excellent pop number which is the highlight of this collection. 
But it's a pleasant enough bunch of tunes &dash. and maybe if multitalented songwriter and lead singer Gary Newby, who produced the aforementioned single and designed the album's record sleeve, is allowed to produce more of his songs in the studio, the band could live up to their undoubted promise. 
Another <tag>band</> who are almost very good are the Katydids, who played the Old Fire Station in Oxford this week.

They had to lie about my age to get me in, because I was small then. 
I was always interested in the melodic side of music and I started playing bugle rather than drums, and I stayed in that <tag>band</> until I was about 16."

Formed by the enigmatic Arthur Kadmon, Ludus became a vehicle for Linder's obscure and often unintelligible feminist lyrical and visual montages. 
A strange <tag>band</>, they rode a jazzy musical offshoot which often bordered on directionless experimentalism.

Even the most modest promotional push entails an expense of resources amounting virtually to the defence budget of a developing nation. 
Which leaves the Green pop musician with a dilemma: how to draw on the oxygen of publicity without polluting the air? 
A <tag>band</> from Essex called The Brotherhood of Lizards are taking their principles with them into the field by touring to promote their first album (Lizardland, Deltic Records), not in the obligatory transit van, but on bicycles.

All it needs is one ill-timed abbreviation and a deal could go out of the window. 
THE MERRY <tag>band</> which makes up the Australian financial markets seems as attached to a lunchtime tipple as ever.   

700048
Of the two, I'd go for the Polydor collection, partly because it serves as a decent sampler of a wider range of Brazilian talent, like Caetano Veloso and Luiz Caldas, although dance parties are probably better served by the CBS LP's flow of smooth Miami Sound-alikes. 
WITH THE recent commercial success of <tag>bands</> like The Stone Roses and Happy Mondays, you could be forgiven for thinking that British pop had entered its first new phase since the `pure pop" explosion of 1982 (which saw the emergence of acts like the Human League, Altered Images and Haircut 100).

`I'm very proud of the fact that our music flies in the face of the accepted notions of youth culture and attracts all ages.

The most important song in the world was released in May 1983. 
Backed with `Handsome Devil", it proved the perfect artifact to display the succinct yet overall perception of just what this strange new <tag>band</> was all about. 

700051
Scott Fitzgerald dubbed the Twenties `the jazz age" but in truth the Fifties did more to earn that title. 
The line of jazz development was splitting into its separate streams. 
Progressive or `cool" modern jazz was still a minor tributary, exploring the experimental language of Bop discovered by Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie for a small, dedicated <tag>band</> of disciples. 

700052
He sought no status for himself. 
Yet his science ensures that the stature of Charles Pedersen will grow relentlessly with the passage of time. 
Henry Hall was born and brought up in South East London, writes Albert Jakeway, and from his earliest days he was linked up with the Salvation Army at Nunhead, where he eventually took his place in the <tag>band</>.  

700054
Overall, the performance is excellent: the first movement is remarkably close to Mackerras in both feeling and timing, namely hard &dash. but not over-driven. 
The Hanover <tag>Band's</> second movement is more leisurely than Mackerras, while the Scherzo is less so.   

700055
This show will run and run. 
RUTHLESSLY AND efficiently putting down insurrections but retaining the support of the idolising masses, Mark E Smith's Fall dynasty has always led a charmed existence as the <tag>band</> that can do no wrong. 

700056
A vehicle for the obvious talents of singer Vince Hill, the show was a big success last year at The Mill, at Sonning, which would have suited its cosy and informal presentation. 
But in the vastly bigger space at the Apollo it comes across as entertainment on a shoestring There is but a single setting &dash. a stone staircase flanked by two Greek columns and surrounded by white drapes &dash. and the main variation comes in the garish assortment of light in which it is bathed. 
The meagre four-piece <tag>band</> cannot hope to do justice to the music (though they try hard accompanying some of Novello's best-known songs), and its cast of only nine leads to continuous confusion for the audience in trying to work out who is who.   

700057
Bicester town councillors want a clean sweep of the posters that deface several properties in the town centre including two in Market Square and two in Sheep Street. 
After Mr Brian Abbs complained about the phenomenon of flyposting, town councillors at their plans committee this week agreed to ask the planning authority Cherwell District Council to take action. 
Mr Abbs told councillors that he was not worried about small posters advertising local events, but posters for rock <tag>bands</> and others carrying religious slogans.

St Cross College celebrated its 25th birthday in style with music, dancing and an exhibition. 
University Chancellor Lord Jenkins was guest of honour at a dinner to mark the silver jubilee and on Saturday there was an open day, attended by about 300 students, former students and fellows. 
An exhibition was followed by dancing to a jazz <tag>band</> in a marquee set up at St Cross' St Giles site.

His evidence of the natural violence in Chinese society somehow makes his explanation of the corruption and chaos in the student movement seem ordinary and normal.

Lush's large audience, most of whom chatter blithely through the sensitive acoustic numbers, seem to agree. 
LONDON TOWN's biggest maverick, Cari, the man after whom the <tag>band</> is modestly named, seems to have finally found his pointy toed feet. 

700061
Where have all the peace songs gone? 
The silence is deafening as usual &dash. especially from the wanker <tag>bands</> who freely exploit CND logos and all manner of love and flowers imagery to cream in the profits on the back of people who put their {typo bad="f**king",good="fucking"} arses on the line for the self same cause.

The winner gets to organise the event next year. 
Performers will be required to skate round the rink to the strains of a jazz <tag>band</>.

Alec Kennedy is the area librare, brare, {vocal sound="laugh"} I knew I was going to have trouble with that, the area librarian who's behind all this. 
Alec, it's a huge project, and {vocal sound="um"} the <tag>band</>, where have you, where have you got them from? 

700064
Another rule of thumb is that if the act is obliged to rest their microphone stand and amplifiers on beer crates instead of the stage, it will be a good evening. 
There are two types of pub rock occasions: those, like the one described above, where the <tag>band</> is likely to suffer from agrophobia; and those where the pub is so crowded, death through asphixiation seems to be the only way to get out.   

700065
But just to prove what a bunch of contrary bastards they can still be, `Arms Control Poseur", combining a relentless bass drum with Smith's diffident sneering, soars about the me&circ.le&acute.e, shattering any doubts as to the band's continued well-being. 
As irritable as ever (Mark Smith's only comment was to compare the trendy utilitarian decor of The Waterfront to that of an open prison), The Fall's lip cuts more ice when it's backed up by more than just Smith's mouthings. 
The stonking irony is that a disappointing Fall gig remains worthy of two of most other <tag>bands</>.   

700066
The debuting vocalist therefore spent the entire set stooping to sing through a microphone a foot shorter than his requirement, hardly a sure-fire confidence booster. 
They stumbled through, relying in practice room unity and the simplicity of their classical rock <tag>band</> format to ease the atrocious sound problems.

Cloak-and-dagger tactics may be needed at work or when handling subjects concerning your neighbourhood and community, but you must be more open with those nearest your heart to discuss important issues with them. 
CAPRICORN (Dec 22-Jan 20): The shining <tag>band</> of hope encompassing your plans and projects yesterday is dulled and tarnished by a heavy pall of gloomy glumness today. 

700069
The album features their powerful, poppy single You Could Be Forgiven released some time ago, which was rarely heard, if at all, on the airwaves. 
The track which best illustrates the <tag>band's</> softer side is a spare love song featuring some heart-rending strings, called  Careful.   

700071
The truth is that Mark had always known him as Steven and naturally found it ridiculous to change to Morrissey. 
Considering this, the explosion of the most minor points, it isn't difficult to understand why a seemingly pointless paranoia affects the band's every discourse. 
But, if they can't break the star system, if it is impossible for a <tag>band</> of this stature to remain an `ordinary existence" (although it must be stated that New Order deliberately unglamourise their existence, wisely slowing down their schedules and viciously guarding their faceless media presence.

William's Uncle Brian, who is the Band's principle cornet player, was at the ceremony as were two of William's uncles who used to play in the Band; John, a trombone player and Mark, a cornet player. 
Karen said: `William has put a lot of time into the Band in the past and its nice that they came to play for him." 
Deborah's father Mr Ken Raffell said: `We thought it would be good to have the <tag>Band</> along to the wedding."

Mr da Silva, known as Lula, is to speak. 
`Down with imperialism", screams a huge red banner. 
If Mr Collor's crowd came just for the <tag>band</>, Lula was preaching to the converted. 

700077
But you know, they could still get up there and do it, so why not?" 
There were other acts who seemed to be riding the same wave: in London in the autumn of 1989, you could have seen Jethro Tull (a <tag>band</> 22 years old), The Who (fast approaching 30), Aerosmith (nearly 20), and The Beach Boys (28-ish).

Even the Saudi-controlled mosque in Regent's Park, which is mostly used by Arab tourists, joined in this demonstration of Muslim unity. 
Hesham El-Essawy is a one-man <tag>band</> whose sole purpose appears to be to sabotage the Muslim campaign against The Satanic Verses.   

700080
Eventually"}, we decided to do it there and everyone hated {typo bad="ne",good="me"} by the end of the album because it's right in the middle of nowhere and there's nothing to do, but because we did the album pretty quickly it didn't worry me because I was always busy, but if you're a musician and you've done your bit, you've obviously got time to hang out and there's nothing to do except watch videos and walk in the forest, and things. 
It is great in the winter because you can ski, being a ski resort, and the reason we were there with The Police was because they enjoy skiing, but this was May, just after the snow had gone. 
We had Omar Hakim on drums, Carlos Alomar on guitar, who also works as musical director for the <tag>band</>, Carmine Rojas who was on bass, and keyboards were really done by David and derek, who was producing. 

700081
With their unique dance / chic approach they quickly became very popular and have maintained their following. 
One of their cleverest moves was to adopt a distinctive `Soviet" image military outfits, party haircuts and a logo saying `Proletarian Jazz <tag>Band</>".

`We are hoping to get into more places in Abingdon and Oxford," said singer Paula Blackwell. 
In Oxford at the Jericho Tavern the same night are Witney rock <tag>band</> Direct Detour.

`We don't like it at all," she protests. 
`It's like saying an all-woman band are just vaginas on stage. 
It's really sexist, lumping us together with <tag>bands</> who really have nothing to do with each other, and nothing to do with us.   

700084
Needless to say, these commands were ignored. 
The beach people who occupied the linear city of the Mediterranean coast, some 3,000 miles long and 300 metres wide, were now a very different breed. 
The police and gendarmerie who arrived at the coastal resorts found militant <tag>bands</> of body-worshippers who had no intention of resuming their previous lives. 

700086
As a group develops, it slowly attains a responsibility towards the people who work for it. 
Suddenly there is a regular road crew who become attached to the <tag>band</>.

Scots music is all about the voice and the person &dash. that's why Country, folk-rock and older, more emotional forms are so dominant. 
And, for better or worse, Hue And Cry are a Glasgow <tag>band</>."   

700088
Strangely enough, it was Factory Records who were reported to be the front runners, but these rumours were strongly denied by Factory. 
All this resulted in an angry Geoff Travis (founding supremo of Rough Trade) saying: `If anyone wants The Smiths they'll have to give Rough Trade three million and me personally another three million." 
This deliberately throwaway remark hints at the paranoia within the ranks of Rough Trade where The Smiths are the only <tag>band</> of stature that they had managed to retain. 

700089
Who's that old tosser at the bar? 
Is he there to check out the <tag>band</> or does he just want to feel your bottom while they're on?

`We had such a great time on stage that we wanted to  do something else," said Kylie. 
`I knew the words to Little  Eva's `The Locomotion", the backing was simple and the <tag>band</>  knew the song, so we raced out and did an impromptu  performance," she added.

Yarnton Band's annual general meeting in the Band Room, Little Blenheim, on February 14 was not well attended, despite a special plea to parents. 
But at least it concluded with some hope for the Band's survival. 
The chairman, Mr David Thornton, noted the <tag>Band's</> one success in the year, the Bayswater contest, with Alex Carr and Claire Roberts outstanding.

Instead, he became an icon. 
His grave in Paris is a shrine, his records still sell well, and echoes of his music can be heard in <tag>bands</> like the Stone Roses, The Charlatans and James.

However, the chairman has no intention of neglecting DAKS-Simpson's traditional customers.

There was more satisfaction in Holst's familiar arrangement of `In The Bleak Midwinter", where the addition of a florid lute accompaniment to his part-writing neatly brought together his post-Victorian sentiment and his love of Elizabethan music. 
It was good, too, to hear the jaunty 1686 version of `Greensleeves," which includes as good a solstice toast as any: `And here for good liquor we shall not lack, Twill whet my brains and strengthen my back, This jolly good cheer it must go to wrack, God send us a merry New Year." 
THE REMARKABLY sure-footed David Byrne, having assembled a touring <tag>band</> of the cream of New York's salseros, was not about to skimp on the presentation.

Oh, so it's, so it's, it's not even, it's not people who are around in nineteen forty then? 
Oh no, the {vocal sound="um"}, to, to maintain authenticity, the people in the <tag>band</> have to look as if they would looked in nineteen forty, which is why {vocal sound="um"} Sally Edwards who's the Vera Lynn look-alike {vocal sound="um"} would be more authentic than Vera Lynn herself.   

700102
The other tracks are two covers of classic clues songs: Willie Dixon's `Wang Dang Doodle" on the 7-inch and, on the 12-inch and CD, Muddy Waters' `Mannish Boy". 
There will be an album from the <tag>band</>, full of unlikely cover versions.   

700103
After serious trouble at Sham gigs, for example the one at the London School of Economics, they also deserted their followers. 
The discarded skins were drawn to other bands, such as Screwdriver, Cockney Rejects, Angelic Upstarts, Cocksparr and Bad Manners. 
These <tag>bands</> would either play their sets regardless of fights, or, in the case of Fat Man Doug Trendle &dash. the front man of Bad Manners &dash. would wade in and sort out the rucks himself. 

700104
In retrospect, it seems no big deal to have made and persisted with such predictions, yet the pressures to conform were considerable; but all the arguments made me even more convinced that I was correct. 
In 1974 the electorate, in two elections, threw out Edward Heath and elected Harold Wilson and his curious <tag>band</> of expropriating socialists.   

700105
It was those sessions which won the band initial recognition and a recording contract. 
It seemed a perfect opportunity to satisfy the twin hungers of record company and fans alike. 
For the <tag>band</> it was an effortless release, effectively supplying a breathing space &ellip. and lastly, making more money.

One of Britain's finest music journalists, the sadly redundant Nick Kent, decided to re-enter the world of journalism via a retrospective on the one group he found worthy, The Smiths. 
Indeed a tremendous compliment to the <tag>band</>, and manager Scott Piering welcomed the exercise.   

700109
Last year, Michael Grade, the BBC Director General, heard that the injunction on Frank's film had expired. 
He planned to schedule it as the <tag>band</> began the tour which was to net them #100m each.

And Harry Towb brings all the dignity he can muster to the role of rich Yale banker endowed with lines like `I think of you and time stands still &dash. your face would stop a clock." 
Everything is done with total conviction rather than nudging camp; and this applies equally to Tony Walton's swivelling shipboard designs (with the <tag>band</> on the upper deck) and to Michael Smuin's choreography with its mixture of frenzied tap and soft-shoe shuffles.

The Yerba Buena jazz band (Yerba Buena &dash. `Good Earth" &dash. was the original name of San Francisco) used a tuba and a banjo in the rhythm section, as opposed to string bass and guitar in conventional <tag>bands</> of the time. 

700113
Daughter June had inherited some of her father's wanderlust and had a yearning for show business. 
A one-time Italian <tag>band</> singer, Donald Forcillo-Rose, came out of the woodwork in October 1980 to claim that he and June were lovers when she was just sixteen and he was twenty-six, and that she became pregnant.   

700114

A year ago, when your trousers didn't condemn you as a person, Bobby Gillespie started going to house clubs; he wore ripped jeans and a sad top, but was truly touched by what was happening around him. 
So when his <tag>band</> Primal Scream released `Loaded", one of the best winter dance records, everything seemed sweet. 

700116
Their first gig was set at the Manchester Ritz, supporting the hyped Blue Rondo A La Turk on October 4th 1982. 
The <tag>band</> approached the event with some trepidation.   

700117
Jo loathed her blobby nose, her receding chin, her long body, her short legs, her droopy ass, her fat thighs, her white skin that absolutely refused to tan and her brown hair which frizzed and which her mother wouldn't even let her frost; she accepted that she would never look like Faye Dunaway, never be a Prom Queen and that most of her body was a total disaster area, but she knew with absolute certainty that she had great tits. 
The upper slopes rose softly almost from her collar bone, the lower curves were rich and full and the nipples pointed invitingly upwards. 
Most days Jo left the house with her breasts strapped into a brassiere that had been tailored for her by her mother's corsetie&grave.re, two thick white cotton cones attached to a four-inch <tag>band</>, meagrely edged with broderie anglaise.

Smiths are, unfortunately, helping to bolster up all those cruds still clinging to the starting line and holding the starting gun. 
They are the last rock'n'roll <tag>band</> before a new and better rock'n'roll race / creed begins.

`We don't. 
You've got to hear the <tag>band</> sounding crap sometimes.   

700122
His new recording of  Beethoven's Seventh and Eighth Symphonies (Oiseau-Lyre 425 695-2), however, is very good indeed. 
The recording quality is much superior to that given to the Hanover <tag>Band</> or even Norrington.   

700123
Through their writings and their daily contacts with the members they help to focus the attention on one figure &dash. the saint after whom the group is named. 
It is he alone who is thought to have been able to act as a channel for God's particular grace through different acts and occurrences; it is he alone who can be accredited with helping to bring about the amazing moment when one comes into contact with the determining purpose that rules the world. 
The disciples (as we may call the inner core of officers, for many of them are old enough to have known the saint and to have been part of his original <tag>band</> of followers) are therefore crucial in the control of miracles. just as they restrict the manifestation of ecstasy (that other dangerous and disruptive force that has its place within Sufism), so they act to guard the gates of blessing. 

700124
You can't get enough of a good thing! 
What you can get more than enough of is Safe Sex (When It Comes 2 Loving U) on the Virgin label from Pandora's Box, the New York <tag>band</> fronted by four female vocalists and masterminded by Jim Steinman of Meat Loaf fame.   

700125
He probably could have argued that I don't belong in these clubs either, because I haven't got a soul / funk background. 
Yes, I agree, `if you mentioned clubs to most indie <tag>bands</> 18 months ago they would have spat in your face", but only because the elitists controlled it.   

700126
The group was devoted to the authentic recreation of the music of Jelly Roll Morton and particularly Joe King Oliver. 
Watters and Bob Scobey provided a two-cornet lead for the band in the way that Louis Armstrong and Joe had done in the King Oliver band a couple of decades before. 
Banjoist Clancy Hayes became famous as the <tag>band's</> vocalist.   

700127
Prizes were presented by Mrs Valerie Wayerhouse, who won the premier Women in Business award in 1989. 
Cholsey Silver Band will be playing away on Sunday July 22 &dash. on the bandstand in Hyde park. 
The <tag>band's</> chairman, Bill Bradshaw, said they had previously played in Kensington Gardens for the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the Great Western Railway in 1985.   

700129
This is not a metaphor. 
It is an economic necessity: `Sure, if I had my choice I'd travel with a <tag>band</>, limos, drivers and hot-and-cold-running groupies, but they cost.

For the outsider, however, it's often difficult to tell whether Dublin is undergoing a prolonged rock renaissance or simply wallowing in a lazy, hand-me-down hippiedom that outlived its sell by date everywhere else. 
The Hothouse Flowers are the <tag>band</> most easily tagged with the title `nouveau hippies".  

700133
He said the Church of England report `Faith in the City" was admirable in its aim to improve the position of the under-privileged in the inner cities but added that it had been widely criticised for its economic assumptions. 
Finally, news of an event which reached us too late for inclusion in our Dates for Your Diary column on page 4: The Letcombe Singers, accompanied by Wantage Silver <tag>Band</> , will present a programme of music including Vivaldi's Gloria and Easter hymns at 7.30 p.m. in Wantage Parish Church on Saturday.  

700134
Most such tales are unworthy of inclusion here and, in general, people tended not to believe them. 
But the `no smoke without fire" theory remained in people's minds, all of which was a direct product of the <tag>band</>'s status and a residue of success which leaves initial followers with a sense of loss as `their" band goes public.

Uncle John's <tag>Band</> &dash. Grateful Dead (Workingman's Dead, Reprise 1970) The penny was beginning to drop among the rock community that light-shows, extended jamming and mescaline weren't necessarily the answer.   

700136
At the opposite extreme, an award for a rehabilitation scheme on a problem estate, in Wirral, offered a reminder of what most urban local authorities are struggling against &dash. the mistakes of an earlier generation, some of them previous Housing Design Award winners. 
A single example of inner city housing for the homeless served as a reminder of our astounding national and professional complacency which considers housing design to be a matter of <tag>banded</> brickwork and joinery detail and not about the best means of providing that ultimate symbol of dignity, a roof over your head.   

700137
It took a lot of worry away from him. 
The <tag>band</> were very supportive and they knew they didn't have to do anything untoward.

Roger Wooton: 
David Bowie was the resident singer/ song writer &dash. a sort of folk-pop singer/ song writer and we were a sort of rock/acoustic <tag>band</> &dash. flute, violin, acoustic guitars and female vocalist, doing sets each week at the club which was the start of our career. 

700139
Some 50,000 people celebrated the arrival of the US ambassador when he came to see President Moawad in the town of Ehden, in the foothills of the Mount Lebanon range in the north of the country. 
A <tag>band</> played the Lebanese and US national anthems outside the president's palace, a cacophony that might have symbolised the genuine desire of Christian Maronites in northern Lebanon for their new president but which could not disguise the fact that he should have been receiving Mr Mccarthy at the presidential palace at Baabda, north- east of Beirut.   

700140
THE world music boom must be doing wonders for geography teachers. 
African music fans know as much about Mali as jazz fans know about New Orleans, and the growing popularity of east-European styles has meant that even Transylvania is on the musical map, and not just for vampires, thanks to the mournfully thrilling Marta Sebesteyen and Muzsikas. 
The <tag>band</> are Hungarian, a group of classically trained musicians who decided to follow Bartok in checking out their musical heritage.   

700141
You could tell it was important &dash. he shouted it in each of those single-beat pauses between key-changes where Bruce Springsteen would say `Hah". 
And if he forgot it, there was an 18-foot-high prompt emblazoned on the backdrop behind the splendid drummer's head. 
Hop was about all the heaving melee at the front, intent on forming a steaming scrum-of-worship at the <tag>band's</> feet, could manage in the crush.   

700142
The Interior Minister, Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, led a solemn ceremony for the arm, which was separated by a cannonshot from the former president, General Alvaro Obregon, in 1915. 
As a military <tag>band</> played a dirge, the ashes were removed from the Mexico City monument where the arm had been exhibited for years. 

700143
Not only could he pinpoint quite closely where the music came from, but he knew a Hungarian version of the same dance. 
The tunes are often similar; the difference lies in the style of playing and articulation. 
It is a string-based sound &dash. a typical <tag>band</> consists of a violin, playing the melody (it is often the particular ornamentation of this that gives away the location); a `kontre", a three-stringed viola, playing chords; and a three-stringed double-bass.

They have rescheduled the gig at the Oxford Venue, Cowley Road, for next Friday.

Most such tales are unworthy of inclusion here and, in general, people tended not to believe them. 
But the `no smoke without fire" theory remained in people's minds, all of which was a direct product of the band's status and a residue of success which leaves initial followers with a sense of loss as `their" band goes public. 
Like Morrissey in 1977, many in Manchester felt left behind and even fairly close friends found it difficult to gat close to the <tag>band</>.   

700146
Whitney, defending himself, said: `I go to Oxpens college and there are lots of people that use it." 
Magistrates' chairman, the Duke of Marlborough, warned Whitney he would be treated much more severely if he appeared before the court again on a drugs offence. 
THE Apollo Theatre, Oxford, is expecting to be busy tomorrow when tickets go on sale for the visit of Iron Maiden &dash. arguably the world's greatest heavy rock <tag>band</>. 

700147
Ominously he was missing from the line-up when the band played at the Nice Jazz Festival. 
In May he recorded a session for the Basie band's latest compact disc and has a fine six-minute feature to himself on Ellington's composition Do Nothin' Till You Hear From Me. 
This was an appropriate last recording for a man who had admitted that whenever he went to hear Duke Ellington's <tag>band</> with Paul Gonsalves he stood with his mouth open in wonder. 

700148
It was brief, pithy and, like everything Lewis wrote in prose, hugely readable. 
None of that small <tag>band</> of men who sat round smoking and drinking their beer or whisky could have had any idea, as they heard Jack vigorously defending the doctrine of hell in nine pages, that the publication of these religious speculations, pieced together at a busy time between giving lectures and examining, was to change his destiny forever.   

700149
`All our things are country things that have been well used over the years, and we use them all the time, and live with them, and enjoy them." 
And as if to demonstrate this, a <tag>band</> of children and grandchildren suddenly troops in, receiving from Cormack the sort of effusive welcome only a 13-stone Irish wolfhound can give.   

700150
Victim released two singles, `Strange Thing By Night" and `Why Are Fire Engines Red". 
In Belfast they achieved minor fame (on their bedroom wall a poster proudly displayed a Belfast Victim gig with support <tag>band</> The Undertones) but in Manchester they slipped away into the endless dull circle of local pub gigs.  

700153
Reuter adds: The US and Japan agreed yesterday to high-level talks to put world trade back into better balance. 
The talks, announced in a statement by Mr Bush and the Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Sosuke Uno, will tackle Japan's retail distribution system. 
All that's left is a silly <tag>band</> of gold.   

700154
A gig which saw The Smiths performing as a five-piece for the last time. 
Amidst accusations that Marr had used Craig Gannon to rockify the <tag>band</>, The Smiths dispensed with Gannon almost immediately after the curtain fell in Manchester. 

700155
All the same, Jones has got an intriguing programme together, opening this evening with My Left Foot, the film Cannes unwisely rejected but which contains one of the very best performances of the year by Daniel Day Lewis. 
In between, there is a special performance of Buster Keaton's Sherlock Jr, with a new score by Paul Robinson, played by the composer's eight-piece Harmony <tag>Band</>, and a special series of French films, including a Bresson season organised by the French cultural delegation in Cambridge.   

700156
Frame had actually been approached but, sensibly perhaps, declined to involve himself. 
Within the ranks of the music press, there seemed to be a genuine grief at the split and the <tag>band's</> loyal followers responded accordingly, filling the letter pages with tearful, doleful sentiment.   

700158
Nurtured from their East End up bringing under the patronage of Punk revolutionary Jimmy Pursey, producer of their debut `Flares &and. Slippers" EP, they fast became the sort of blokes you'd avoid in the kebab shop come chucking out time. 
A deal with EMI beckoned, and 15-year-old singer Stinky Turner was soon going on stage in his pyjamas and bawling, `You insult my intelligence but I a not a fool!" to the band's legion of admirers (affectionately known as `The Rubber Glove Firm"). 
Chart successes loomed from the other side of the terraces, and the <tag>bands</> were now able to wallpaper their bedrooms with Sounds front covers.   

700159
However, apart from a continuous and fairly boring trickle of snide remarks in the gossip columns (mainly digs at Morrissey's claims to a celibate lifestyle), nothing of any real harm was seen in print. 
Dave McCullouch: `I remember once, though, when Sounds were searching for an interview and I happened to know that the whole thing was a set-up. 
I knew it was a deliberate attempt from the word go to bring the <tag>band</> down.

PRAVDA'S new editor may have an unexpected relish for arguing about religion.

Members of the Launton-Gavray twinning association and friends will be celebrating Mardi Gras in true New Orleans-style tomorrow night. 
The main French flavour for the Mardi Gras party, which the association is staging in the village hall for members and friends, will come not from Normandy &dash. home of Launton's French twin Gavray &dash. but from New Orleans, the home of Mardi Gras. 
Local jazz <tag>band</> Just Dixie will be providing live music and food provided by members will include the authentic New Orleans Jambalaya &dash. a spiced seafood-and-vegetable risotto-type starter &dash. and garlic bread, Launton roast gammon and salad, plus a surprise dish to end the meal.

700166
It's rather a shame but it's official, as this show made clear. 
In front of the staggeringly numerous faithful &dash. one album almost two years ago, yet the six-deep queue of goths, punks and sundry head-bangers stretched 50 yards up Charing Cross Road &dash. the <tag>band</> showcased new material, and a worryingly eager attempt to prove They Really Can Play. 

700167
The leading authority was the House of Lords case of Re W (1971) AC 682 where it was held that when dealing with the question of withholding consent, the test was reasonableness, not culpability or indifference, and although the child's welfare per se was not the test, it was relevant. 
Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone, LC, said that the question was whether a parental veto came within the <tag>band</> of possible reasonable decisions and not whether it was right or mistaken and that there was a band of decisions within which the court should seek to replace the individual's judgment with his own.   

700168
Twenty players share the other parts between them, with noteworthy contributions from Mike Leyland, John Marshall, Jon Briggs, Elaine Burgin and Norma Gossip. 
A five-piece <tag>band</> provides enjoyable music.   

700169
SUCH IS the fragile nature of fame that Henry Hall, Britain's best known bandleader of the Thirties, Forties and Fifties, is unknown to younger generations. 
Yet in his heyday, through his radio dance <tag>band</> shows and his pioneering chat-show, Henry Hall's Guest Night, he was as nationally famous a broadcaster as Terry Wogan is today. 

700170
Then, ever so gradually, it slows down. 
As the curtains rose, the <tag>band</> drifted into what would become the night's standard song introduction: two chords, lush with jazzy grace-notes. 

700171
It was here that a friendly Johnny Marr, embarrassed by success, deliberately became a father figure to smaller local acts practicing in the rooms next door. 
One <tag>band</>, Sense Of Purpose, expressed a desire to start a fanzine based around The Smiths.

Only three months later, the Heralds made what Sid described as `a meteoric disappearance". 
Soon after the outbreak of war, he became a member of the RAF's super dance <tag>band</>, the Squadronaires.   

700175
`I've been offered a job." 
When the mild uproar that followed this announcement had died down, Raymond explained that the studio where his <tag>band</> had recorded their demonstration tape had offered him a job as assistant producer. 

700176
Venus Beads `Transfixed"  This is so abrasive that it'll damn near cut you in two. 
Far too tuneful to be described as hardcore and too noisy to be deemed a pop / punk <tag>band</>, The Venus Beads sit comfortably on the barbed wire fence inbetween.   

700177
Communications between them and Rough Trade came to a standstill as they prepared to undertake a short Scottish tour, and from this odd situation a strange story came to light. 
The Smiths invited Rough Trade stablemates Easterhouse to act as support for the tour. 
This wasn't surprising, for not only were Easterhouse Rough Trade's `<tag>band</> most likely", they were also close personal friends of The Smiths.   

700178
In Levi, the faculty of wonder was developed almost to a preternatural degree. 
A visit to the Kremlin Museum, where there hangs on display an elaborate crinoline whose wire <tag>waistband</> conceals a series of china tubes designed as traps for fleas, gives way to a detailed inquiry into how on earth the flea can leap at least one hundred times its own length.   

700179
People had also lent photographs, schoolbooks and other memorabilia for a display which attracted a lot of attention. 
The party included a brass <tag>band</>, Morris Men and the cutting of a huge birthday cake made by Parent-Teacher Association Members.   

700180
`Nothing" `But you've gone all red." 
`The heat," she lied, and prayed for the <tag>band</> to start playing, which it promptly did, this time a waltz.

He'd spent years tied to drum machines and Portostudios, crafting songwriting ideas but without finding the perfect format of presentation. 
He'd played with a few friends over the years but never managed to overcome the logistics of forming and fronting a <tag>band</>.

Britain have six days to find a remedy before the second Test at Elland Road. 
Finding a new <tag>band</> might be a good idea too, what else but a false dawn after flat notes in the national anthems?   

700186
You've got to admire that. 
They are the only <tag>band</> in the country who have anything positive to say.   

700187
Morrissey was unimpressed. 
Later he would spit venom at <tag>Band</> Aid in an interview with Time Out's Simon Garfield.   

700188
In fact the only drawback about the Cube is that you're more than likely to find one or two of the Sounds freelancers propping up the bar but, aside from that, there aren't many better ways to spend the approaching cold winter evenings than in the comfort of decent live music and good company. 
AT LAST it's here &dash. the God-forsaken rumble the world's been waiting for ever since it became clear just how deadly a live phenomenon the Rolins <tag>Band</> are. 

700189
`It was like, well, these groups have all got together and thought `Well, we'll get these haircuts and these clothes and it will give us a concept that people can grab hold on to straight away". 
We thought that that made the members of the <tag>band</> faceless.   

700190
No matter what kinds of videos they do in the future, though, there's one thing that will remain the same &dash. they boys will want to have as much input as possible. 
That means that if the director asks them to do something they don't feel good about or that isn't true to the spirit of the <tag>band</>, they'll ask him if they can do something else.   

700191
It is possible that Lautrec also began his painting in a competitive spirit with Lunel, who was rapidly becoming Paris's leading illustrator of the Montmartre night-life. 
And, while Lunel's illustration reflected the influence of Raffaei&acute.lli, certain of its features suggest that, in addition, he borrowed a number of ideas from Lautrec's Mirliton panel (Fig. 71): the large, cropped figures at the table in the left foreground, the crowd of spectators around the dancers, the angle from which the scene is viewed (permitting the inclusion of the balcony and <tag>band</> at the right).   

700192
The shrinkage of the shellfish industry since its Victorian heyday has even united the five remaining cockling families &dash. traditionally hostile to each other &dash. to form the Thameside Shellfish Company.

All the street windows of the Olive and Dove were open, the curtains fanning out gently over window boxes and over fuchsias that dripped red flowers. 
On the forecourt a <tag>band</> of Morris dancers had assembled. 

700194
In 1926 he became a commissioned officer in the Salvation Army, a commission he resigned in 1944 when his interest in spiritual matters had developed beyond the bounds of Salvationism. 
His contribution to the literature, both choral and instrumental, of the Salvation Army is vast. 
Ball's estrangement from the Salvation Army was to be the secular brass <tag>band's</> gain. 

700195
The probes stick selectively to the stretches of DNA which would normally be complementary to them on the double helix. 
They thus highlight, in all the chopped disorder of the DNA, a distinctive pattern of two or three <tag>bands</> (which can be detected on a piece of photographic film because of the radioactivity). 

700196
Or perhaps more. 
If millions of city dwellers finally discover how nice it is to have easy access to beautiful trees, the political clout of the green lobby, which helped push through these recent changes, will increase. 
Certainly, Alan Mattingly at the Ramblers' Association forecasts a <tag>banding</> together of environmentalists before the next election so that forest fire-power can be pooled.   

700197
They are putting on The Bus To Wanstock, a play based on reminiscences of past Oxfordshire life. 
The Witney Town <tag>Band</> starts a series of concerts on April 8 at the Langdale Hall and June 8 at the Corn Exchange with open air performances at The Leys during the summer.   

700198
These were not issued here until the Fifties and it is therefore understandable that he did not achieve the eminence here that he had in the United States and France. 
This was our loss, for he was an important figure in the history of jazz guitar, and also a most satisfying soloist who played with taste and imagination. 
He ranked with Teddy Bunn as a blues player, and indeed if there are traces of anyone else's playing in Shirley's work then they are from Bunn and Al Casey, who would have been in Fats Waller's <tag>band</> when Shirley heard him. 

700199
The initiative starts on March 20 when the Oxfordshire Touring Theatre Company stages its new play, The Bus to Wanstock, at the Corn Exchange. 
The Witney Town <tag>Band</> is also performing a series of spring concerts from April with some open air performances.   

700200
Dallapiccola, Harnoncourt and Raymond Leppard have all made modern realisations. 
But ENO uses a new edition prepared by Paul Daniel, who conducts a small authentic instrument <tag>band</> for the performances.   

700201
But the sticky electricity with which Prince made the connection was certain to provoke. 
`The God he worships is his genitals," one Minnesotan fundamentalist, who would be organising bonfires of His Royal Badness's vinyl to this day had he not fallen foul of the local clean-air act, stormed. 
Even some of Prince's <tag>band</> members found their leader's blend of the sublime and the profane difficult to take. 

700202
A sense of expectancy on most faces, an edge of excitement as they mounted the stairs to the picture gallery where rows of chairs waited for the party to be seated by court officials. 
The band at the other end playing light music was from the RAF. 
That feeling of expectancy was heightened now, and then the <tag>band</> started to play `God Save the King'.   

700203
And since then we have had time to learn to play our instruments." 
Down From Above reflects the quartet's growing interest in roots music. 
Very much a traditional <tag>band</>, concentrating on live performance rather than studio work, they've picked up, almost by osmosis, influences from people they've played with over the years.   

700204
The relationship between human rights and show business is one of the more recent developments in what has become a very fashionable cause. 
It was only at the end of 1984 that Bob Geldof produced the <tag>Band</> Aid song, the most successful single in the history of British pop music.   

700205
`He just made us feel that we wanted to do something and this is the first opportunity we have had to do it." 
Battle-of-the-bands contests run by Richard have raised more than #3,000 for leukaemia research and if the Apollo Theatre show on April 6 is a sell out, it would raise a further #5,000. 
Richard said: `I talked to the <tag>band</> a bit about leukaemia research, but I didn't really push it."   

700206
Unfortunately, The Darkside have yet to cultivate the same trick, plying a sulky, introverted bedsit groove than which shows altogether too much reverence to an image of Lou Reed on downers. 
It doesn't help that the <tag>band</> are grumpy bastards, expecting monkish silence during songs, and Bros-like adulation afterwards.   

700207
In Husker Du, some people were growing up and others felt no need to. 
That's why they say that it's nice to grow up with a <tag>band</>, but you can't do it in a band because it will break up."   

700208
THE Railway Children have steamed in with their new LP, Native Place (Virgin) &dash. and like British Rail trains, it failed to arrive on time and is slightly old-fashioned. 
The album doesn't really live up to the promise of the single, Every Beat of the Heart, an excellent pop number which is the highlight of this collection. 
But it's a pleasant enough bunch of tunes &dash. and maybe if multitalented songwriter and lead singer Gary Newby, who produced the aforementioned single and designed the album's record sleeve, is allowed to produce more of his songs in the studio, the <tag>band</> could live up to their undoubted promise. 

700209
This letter is particularly directed to the selfish person who, at exactly 7.55am on the morning of Sunday, March 11 stopped a car at the Witney Road entrance to Bampton-in-the-Bush and, quite openly, picked a bunch of daffodils from around the town sign. 
There is, of course, a slight possibility that this person was unaware of the fact that last autumn Margaret Howse and her <tag>band</> of helpers braved the cold weather to plant hundreds of bulbs in and around the town.   

700210
Mons 13/20/27 Pizza Express, Dean St W1 (437 9595). 
Andy Sheppard Sheppard's <tag>big</> band ambitions are now being realised by a changing ensemble which has developed around the nucleus of his regular quintet.   

700211
Where they coexist, the former tends to prefer the gravel, while the latter chooses the clay  reaches. 
The damsels are among the great sights of the midsummer river bank,  along which they flutter, enamelled with peacock blue and green; and it is  entertaining to `read" the physical conditions of a particular stream from the  <tag>band</> on a damsel's wing.   

700212
He wanted to study at the prestigious Juilliard School of Music, as he was entitled to do as an ex-GI. 
But then in 1955 he was offered the chance to tour with the <tag>band</> of another ex-Ellington musician, altoist Johnny Hodges. 

700213
`Man In The Box" starts with a strange array of almost Eastern textures before bleeding into slow-motion rock, `Confusion" goes with grunge driven soul before slowing down again into spaced-out guitar strangeness, and pretty much typifies the way Alice go about things. 
This is one <tag>band</> into barrier breaking and category crushing in a big way.   

700214
No wonder the Waddle-alike kept his eyes firmly shut throughout. 
The headline <tag>band</> was called Girl With A Blue Guitar.   

700215
The coach outside gives the game away &dash. Colchester prodigies The Penny Arcade are playing away and they're bussing 'em in from Essex. 
So, to a screech of whistles the <tag>band</> plunge into a set full of janglign guitars and thrashing drums. 

700216
The Caskies, including Faith, were one of the five. 
A <tag>band</> of children were careering about, playing tig.   

700217
Like Raymond, they were all college dropouts, or youths who hadn't been able to summon up the energy even to start college. 
They lived on the dole and on their parents, and spent their time drinking in pubs or pricing amplifiers in the Rummidge music stores; for they all played electric guitars of various shapes and sizes, and nourished the fantasy of forming a `<tag>band</>" one day, in spite of the fact that none of them could read music and the collective noise they made was so dire that they could seldom find anywhere to rehearse. 

700218
Much of it was a matter of attitude. 
They were steeped in that New York sloppiness that is intensely irritating in the city's `art" <tag>bands</>, but was just fine in a pop group.   

700219
But while Ride and TFC took the indie way out of obscurity, gaining success by giggling like hell while maintaining a strong position in Sounds' indie charts, Five Thirty bit the big one and signed to a major, East West. 
`ABSTAIN" CERTAINLY confirmed a lot of people's fears for the <tag>band's</> identity within corporate confines. 

700220
This may be attributed to the fact that the city's traders were not swamped by the growth of the larger British companies during the colonial period, that among the merchant families involved in the kola nut trade, two generations were common, and that merchant families in Kano were particularly successful from the early 1960s at forming links with overseas companies, not least with those from the Far East. 
It may also have been connected with the recurring impact in Kano of the Islamic `ascetic" movements, particularly current in commercial circles. 
However the situation found in Kano was not typical of west Africa or even of Nigeria, and the <tag>one-man-band</> was and is the predominant theme.   

700221
An inescapable irony. 
How the consequences of this situation are dealt with, by both <tag>band</> and fans, is dealt with quite openly within this book.   

700222
Shumov refuses to sing in English, claiming that his mission is to establish Russian as an international rock language. 
At the very dawn of his career Igor was fired as lead singer in a <tag>band</> that chose Zhanna Aguzarova in his place. 

700223
This is, as Morrissey well knows, a perfectly natural human condition. 
A hyper-sensitive fellow, such things cause him great and needless upset but to the rest of the <tag>band</>, it is largely water off a duck's back, and they are dutifully protective of their singer, as are many of the people working around the band.   

700224
Not surprisingly, their most fanatical fan happened to be Steven Morrissey. 
He was to be found lurking in the <tag>band's</> dressing room whenever they ventured into Mancunian territory, which was often. 

700225
`We figured it would be a do-or-die proposition. 
The <tag>band</> was very carefully planned and we rehearsed almost every night during the last half of 1939 at a place called The Big Bear, in the Berkeley Hills.   

700226
His shouts of `Skinheads are back" gained him his skinhead audience too. 
After serious trouble at Sham gigs, for example the one at the London School of Economics, they also deserted their followers. 
The discarded skins were drawn to other <tag>bands</>, such as Screwdriver, Cockney Rejects, Angelic Upstarts, Cocksparr and Bad Manners. 

700227
Led by Teenage Mutant Hero Biker dude Alex Mitchell, Circus Of Power are well into the concept or raising hell. 
This might be essentially kerosene-laced gutter rock, but very few <tag>bands</> can deliver with the power and energy COP wring out of it.   

700228
The continuity thesis is not without some merit if carefully defined. 
Traditional football had been an expression of male prowess and village pride sanctioned by custom and loosely supervised by adults. 
Under industrialization these games and the `<tag>bands</> of youth" were either suppressed or marginalized.   

700229
But does it really matter if half our ponds vanish? 
Do they deserve #30,000 of Shell/Department of the Environment money, plus Richard Branson, the Albion <tag>Band</>, a 45-minute `Pond Workshop", the Wetland Quiz, and all the other fun and games planned for the WWT headquarters at Slimbridge over the weekend of July 22-23? 

700230
The singer was unable to complete the show at Newcastle University on October 28, which resulted in a mini-riot. 
A spokesman for the <tag>band</> said: `He managed the first number, but had to leave the stage, almost collapsing, halfway through the second song. 

700231
Some of the dancing in Requiem was way below this standard yet the ballet still came across as one of MacMillan's most monumental works. 
Its tableaux of suffering and benediction are on a scale that easily matches Faure's score and its concluding lifts are exquisite &dash. the women floating high above the men like angels breast-stroking through paradise. 
WHILE The Stones appealed to the students, and the Beatles to the girls and their mums, The Who were always the lads' <tag>band</>. 

700232
`That will cost you four-fifty, Mr Caldecote," continued the driver, pronouncing the name in its owner's style as from the very first time &dash. `it's gone up again, I'm afraid, which is one of the penalties we pay for having a strong government." 
Harry just had time to catch a brief, confused picture of himself as one of a small, persecuted <tag>band</> of taxpaying heterosexuals eating bacon butties, drinking claret and reading hardbound books in a songless, televisionless cranny in the bowels of some underground Irving of the future before the marble, brass and plush of the reality enfolded him. 

700233
Joe Moss, however, was beginning to feel ill at ease as the rest of the band indulged in typical rock 'n' roll trappings that were at odds with Morrissey's stated philosophy. 
(The next visit to the States would intensify his annoyance and prove instrumental in his departure from the band). 
However, despite this and despite signing a lucrative deal in America with Sire, the <tag>band</> were not over impressed with the Americans.  

700234
No, the basic point is this. 
The whole rise of professionalism, that is a group of white collar individuals <tag>banding</> together to ensure common standards but also to maintain reasonably high rewards, is not much more than 100 years old.   

700235
Our home for the week was the Gasthof Traube, not far from the resort of Lech where Prince Charles and other celebrities go skiing. 
The hotel is one of a select <tag>band</> that qualify for Vorarlberg's `family specialist" status.   

700236
The old station which was closed to passengers in 1963 was burnt to the ground shortly afterwards. 
AN uncomplimentary review in these pages of The Anyways latest Oxford gig provoked a stream of protest from the <tag>band's</> loyal local following.   

700237
Gonzales dared to sing self-written rolling blues that started off with the line `I woke up this morning" yet didn't sound dated, and dressed them up with fluid solos that could have come straight from some early Gene Vincent session. 
Then he'd move on to a slinky rock-swing passage, switching between lead and rhythm against Thomas Yearsley's walking bass, and follow through with a demented and highly experimental rapid-strum work-out. 
It's the old bar-room blend, but shaken and stirred by a <tag>band</> with skill to march their enthusiasm.  

700238
All have songs ranging from fast to slow, and also songs that incorporate both ends of this range. 
To me, they are highly underrated &dash. they are a <tag>band</> who write tuneful songs and have a very good line-up, despite what Ian Cheek thinks of `Scott Reynolds' hapless inability to sing in anything other than a monotone shout". 

700239
Attila The Stockbroker, the entertaining political poet, is a veteran East German hand: he can remember the days when Berlin was divided. 
On a performing visit there he suggested a tour of Britain by Horch, one of the DDR's leading <tag>bands</>, and said he could use his contacts to set up the venues.  

700240
The scene is a recording studio in Chicago in 1927. 
Taking us through a day of hassles and irritations as Ma Rainey ('the Mother of the Blues') and her <tag>band</> try to cut some new 78s, the play also dramatises (sometimes subtly, sometimes with a sledgehammer) the way the music business makes these black artists turn in on, then turn nasty on, one another. 

700241
`Of course," I say, `Who doesn't." 
`I'll get the <tag>band</> to play it for yer, when you've 'ad yer' dinner," he says.   

700242
He tried. 
All too soon as far as Maggie was concerned the waltz was over and they were clapping the <tag>band</>.   

700244
Existing tickets are valid for the new dates although refunds can be obtained if required form point of purchase. 
Havana 3am , the band formed by ex-Clash man Paul Simenon, will release their eponymmous debut LP, which was recorded in Tokyo in only four weeks, on IRS Records at the beginning of next year. 
The <tag>band</>, who've been gigging only sporadically, will play at least one London show before the ned of November.   

700245
Having been hired to help sort out the programme, I am beginning to feel like the Red Adair of music TV. 
But it seems like a good chance to get some exciting <tag>bands</> on the television and frankly, I do need a new kitchen floor.   

700247
Think of all those candy bars they'll be able to buy. 
FORMED AROUND the nucleus of Canadian techno trash terrorists Dwayne Goettel and Cevin Key of Skinny Puppy, plus Al Nelson of Flu, the Hilt line-up actually precedes Skinny Puppy by several years. 
Nelson and Key played together in punk <tag>bands</> in the late '70s until the latter went to Japan and was taken aback by Tokyo's nascent Technopolitan revolution, with bands like Yellow Magic Orchestra taking the spirit of Kraftwerk into the 21st century. 

700248
There were hardly any smiles, but there was clearly a good deal of pleasure being had in a subdued sort of way. 
Fearful of putting my foot in it and perhaps being knifed by some furious charcutier because I had asked his vendeuse from a boutique near the Gare de Lyon to take a turn on the floor, and also because it was clear that our Mimi and Frou Frou were not here, Ray and I left, whistling a nostalgic tune or two from the Piaf selection the <tag>band</> had been playing.   

700249
Stocks of stationery bearing the old address may be used up, even after the change. 
Band AGM. 
Yarnton <tag>Band</>'s annual general meeting in the Band Room, Little Blenheim, on February 14 was not well attended, despite a special plea to parents. 

700250
That's not to say he aspired to being something of a genius himself, it's just that he felt a tremendous affinity with those people. 
Although Steven Morrissey's general depression, disgust and horror was certainly fuel for his songwriting (he wrote constantly, almost as if in anticipation of the forthcoming <tag>band</>), he never really thought to question why he wrote. 

700251
Moran always came alone to the station to meet them. 
Though he would be nervous with excitement and irritable for days before they came, he was distant and withdrawn as soon as he met them. 
Rose's delight in seeing them was slightly tempered by her natural watchfulness but within an hour she would have completely merged with the <tag>band</> of girls, joking, laughing, getting them to help with chores, always giving them her full attention and they answered to her as if she were another sister rather than their father's wife.   

700252
The record companies seem to agree. 
Although they have enjoyed rave reviews back in Los Angeles, the last two Desert Rose Albums have not been released in Britain, though they sound far more lively and contemporary than the drearily meandering new offering by Crosby and Stills. 
But all that could change judging from his <tag>band's</> British debut at the Mean Fiddler, where even bootleggers were in attendance.   

700253
Rose Of Cimarron &dash. Poco (Rose Of Cimarron, ABC 1976) This was a flash of inspiration in Poco's rather workmanlike career. 
The <tag>band</> never really recovered from being the weaker half of the deceased Buffalo Springfield, the other faction being Messrs Stills and Young. 

700254
Ron Berglas is the performer in this one-man show which looks at the pains and pleasures of playing the double bass in an orchestra. 
Subsequent attractions at Chipping Norton Theatre include Samuel Butler's The Way of All Flesh adapted for the Red Shift Theatre Company; a one-man show on April 27 in which Victor Spinetti impersonates everyone from John Lennon to Princess Margaret; and Millstream Touring Theatre in Cheknov's The Sneeze, which was performed in London two years ago by Rowan Atkinson. 
The musical events at Chipping Norton have a decidedly folky tinge, with John Renbourn and Stefan Grossman next Friday, the Albion <tag>Band</> on May 18, and the Oyster Band (recently seen in BBC 2's Rhythms of the World) on June 10.   

700255
And flowers seemed to occupy a considerable portion of their imaginings. 
The <tag>band</> themselves (Pos, Trugoy the Dove, and DJ Pace-master Mace) reject the `hippy hop" tag: there is more going on here than mere retrospective daisy worship.  

700256
didn't they buy their own apartment in Spain or Majorca, then they could all go separately and stay with their friends, a proposal enthusiastically backed up by Raymond, who came in from the kitchen, where he had been eating his warmed-up lunch because as usual he had come in from the pub too late to sit down at table. 
He also asked Vic if he would lend him and his mates two hundred and fifty pounds to have a `demo tape" of their <tag>band</> made, a request Vic had the satisfaction of turning down flat.   

700257
For Shocked, though, this is almost certainly a transitional phase. 
There is no such flaccidity in her new lyrics, and the <tag>big-band</> arrangements turned this Palladium concert into an exhilarating evening of dance.   

700258
Those who marched were a coalition of wildly different elements: pacifists and Christians, Trade Unionists and Little Englanders, anarchists and rationalists, Beats and ravers, the barefoot and the long-haired and also a great many quiet and concerned young parents pushing prams or carrying infants on their shoulders. 
There were steel <tag>bands</> and folk singers. 

700259
The Fair, which runs from 6-16 June, brings together, under one roof more than 300 of the best antique dealers from all over Britain, specialising in fine furniture, ceramics, siver, textiles, jewellery and a whole range of antiques. 
Exclusively for readers, the event will start at 11.15am with coffee, followed by a 30-minute illustrated talk by Lady Victoria Leatham, one of that knowledgeable <tag>band</> of Antiques Roadshow experts. 

700260
The producer of that record, Stevie Salas, won't deny or confirm the rumours. 
`Cherry Pie", the <tag>band</> claim, is all their own, and it will make them dollar millionaires.   

700261
He stayed a full year in Paris, and then came back to Europe at the end of 1960 with the magnificent band led by Quincy Jones. 
He returned to the United States with this band and was with Quincy when he played at New York's Basin Street East with Peggy Lee and Billy Eckstine. 
In December 1961 the talented Budd Johnson left the Basie <tag>band</>, and Dixon took his place.   

700262
West Berlin bouncers are as thick-headed as their British counterparts: they don't respond to plain English. 
Nor, it seems, was this particular Neanderthal much impressed by German. 
Poems For Laila are Berlin's <tag>band</> of the moment, and it was young Kurt's job to keep the masses out. 

700263
The Smiths fit neatly into this strategy as the exception to the rule. 
That The Smiths dismiss the all important mediums of video fashion and Fairlight affected pulsebeat, yet maintain their status as an immensely successful chart <tag>band</>, is itself a feat worthy of praise. 

700264
`It'll not exactly be standing still when June 16 comes round," promised Andy. 
To celebrate the centenary, a parade of all the Tents, or branches, will kick off from the Stan Laurel pub at 2pm and wind through Ulverston's amazed streets before coming to a halt at Stan's Argyll Street address. 
A gala event in the Coronation Hall, featuring Hi-de-Hi star Jeffrey Holland, a musical based on the comedians" life, a banjo <tag>band</> and surprise guests, is expected to present Acid House organisers with some serious competition.   

700265
It was anything but a solemn occasion. 
A sense of expectancy on most faces, an edge of excitement as they mounted the stairs to the picture gallery where rows of chairs waited for the party to be seated by court officials. 
The <tag>band</> at the other end playing light music was from the RAF. 

700266
`I don't think we're really wacky," considers second bassist Mat, recovering from a fit of laughter. 
`I think we make the most of having a good time, which a lot of bands just don't bother saying." 
`How lucky we are to be in a <tag>band</> and not having to get up every morning to do a crappy job.   

700267
Two young men of that family met us in the street, walking in the heat of the morning. 
The green <tag>band</> around their turbans, their flowing cream-coloured outer garments, and their trim beards all signified the holiness and precedence of their position.   

700268
Worse, though, are the virulent separatist movements which have sprung up in various corners of the country. 
Eta and smaller but equally vicious terrorist <tag>bands</> in Galicia and Catalonia are all the legacy of Franco's repression, even though Spain's autonomous regions now have ample freedom.   

700269
The Smiths have always laid great claims to their art. 
All four <tag>band</> members share the belief that nobody can match the measure of commitment and unity to be found within The Smiths.   

700270
The lower earnings limit will be increased to #46 a week, in line with the single person's pension, and the upper earnings limit will be raised to #350 a week. 
For employers, the upper limits for the three reduced rate <tag>bands</> will be increased broadly in line with prices.   

700271
Until very recently, successive Nationalist governments have clung to the notion that the ANC does not command mass support. 
They have also held that if unbanned, its purportedly small <tag>band</> of radical supporters would resort to violence and create general mayhem.   

700272
Ironically bands feel the same way towards Peel. 
`It's a strange situation," he continues, `When I go and see a band I do feel conspicuous because of my age. 
There's never anyone there within 20 years of 50 and when people stare at me they're either thinking I'm a pervert who's going to come over and feel their bottom when the <tag>band</> are on or I'm `that bloke" from the radio."   

700273
To round off the evening, much more expensively, a last snort may be taken at one of the thinly-attended hotel discotheques. 
Here are the last or bravest remnants of Sri Lanka's bright young things, gyrating to amplified Western sounds, reproduced with uncanny accuracy by talented and entirely unoriginal local <tag>bands</>. 

700274
Moran had gone out already into the fields. 
During the long luxurious breakfast Maggie told Rose and Sheila and Mona more details of her life in London than she was able to the night before &dash. the parties, the dances, the different <tag>bands</> and singers, the boys she met, her girlfriends.   

700275
Her fingernails were never clean, and she had no dress sense at all. 
I will never forget that black rubber outfit she wore (with scuffed stilettoes and laddered fishnet tights) to your father's funeral. 
Also, Baz, she had the intellectual capacity of a withered rubber <tag>band</>. 

700276
They tell each other stories (Sprugg is a poet, like Rodolfo); they flirt harmlessly, get quietly drunk, but they don't swear and they don't you-know-what &dash. it's a family show, in fact, though any child would faint with boredom. 
All this is followed meticulously if at a respectful distance by Doolittle's seven-piece <tag>band</>, written for with a sure ear for tonal balance and a strong sense of the orchestra's role as a virtual extension of the voice, but with little willingness to let the musical idea take over the action. 

700277
It'd be something they remembered." 
`It's good to see real <tag>bands</> on Top Of The Pops," adds John. 

700278
POLICE in Buenos Aires used water cannon and teargas to disperse hooligans disrupting massive celebrations after Argentina beat Italy in the semi-finals of the World Cup. 
Armoured vehicles swept up and down the capital's main streets flushing revellers into side streets after <tag>bands</> of young men clashed with police.   

700279
Hitherto British Gas customers have wasted gas, for example by flaring, in order to benefit from bulk buying. 
One of the alterations to the price schedule, therefore, introduces a fixed monthly charge, combined with a commodity price in each price <tag>band</> &dash. different rates for different volumes of gas. 

700280
I can see they'll get it from that quarter and before very long. 
And it's nothing more than what they deserve, for they're a <tag>band</> of turncoats.  

700281
Sir John's credentials continued to be impeccable, his access to the highest ministers in the land unquestioned. 
Jaguar's chairman, who is still five days away from his fiftieth birthday, was the public's wunderkind and one of Margaret Thatcher's select <tag>band</> of industrial knights. 

700282
I've driven from California to Colorado &dash. this is not an imaginary answer. 
Take It Easy &dash. The Eagles, I Am Constant &dash. The Climax Blues <tag>Band</>, and anything by Journey.   

700283
One of the alterations to the price schedule, therefore, introduces a fixed monthly charge, combined with a commodity price in each price band &dash. different rates for different volumes of gas. 
Anomalies at the interfaces between bands will also be removed. 
Price <tag>bands</> are an important element in the second group of changes, the prime aim of which is to ensure fairness in the corporation's dealings with customers.

Like when someone says that the records you love are just plastic junk and they are the sort of people who read and rake in all that shit in the daily papers, then it makes me think that my daily intake of media is far superior to theirs. 
The Smiths, yeah, they are a thinking man's <tag>band</>.   

700285
(They were helped to wash cars by their fathers!) 
The <tag>band</> admits children from eight upwards.   

700286
However, as the wheels within wheels of the music industry continue to grind, the question of exactly what is an independent company comes into focus.

A minor <tag>band</> signed to London like, say, Easterhouse, are fully distributed by Rough Trade.

`Looking back, it would appear obvious that the situation of the men and women who rushed out that morning to defend themselves and their towns against the army attack was quite hopeless. 
`It did not occur however to the sleepy and mostly unarmed men who rushed the Montana barracks in Madrid against all the rifles and machine guns of the biggest garrison in Spain, that by all the laws of war they could never take those barracks `They took them, and when they got inside they saw a line of twenty or thirty officers with big automatic pistols, lined up behind a parapet, green and shaking not with fear only, but with astonishment, at the huge heroism of the people who had thrown themselves against the machine-gun emplacements and the riflemen, and broken their way in against odds which were intended to be, and ought to have been, overwhelming. 
`The half-dozen men who held the inside of the telephone building at Barcelona, the three who held the radio station against a whole troop of Fascist officers, that white-haired Communist woman, Caridad Mercadet, who led a little <tag>band</> of men and women with rifles, sporing guns and two airguns against the Army Command building at the bottom of the Rambla, did not, it seems, grasp that such things are impossible.   

700288
This might sound like irresponsibility, but, given how the performance pans out, you could also read it as professional commitment; the longer the show goes on, the more the drink goes down and, in a remarkable contradiction of physics, the tighter the playing becomes. 
In fact, midway through the first song, only the size of the <tag>band</> dissuaded you from buying a round to speed up the process.   

700289
This was not such a bad thing at this stage. 
Morrissey's songwriting still stemmed from the angle of poverty and this early repertoire would last for eighteen months of success. 
The Smiths, defying the trend of white electro beat, found themselves at the forefront of a new wave of `pick up your guitar" <tag>bands</>.   

700290
She was  consoled in the knowledge that no-one would believe a girl next  door like her any more anyway. 
A multi-millionairess with a fortune estimated at more than #10  million, a property tycoon in Australia where she was spending a  fortune renovating her latest acquisition, a mammoth Victorian  town house in the Melbourne suburbs, a singer poised to come of  age with a backing <tag>band</> of her own and a world tour &dash. the  hologramic face of high technology in Japan, how could she ever  again have been expected to have slipped into oily dungarees to  tinker with the engine of a Land Rover?   

700291
I also met Lord Tryon, who is, I know, very proud of all his wife's achievements. 
De Beers were very generous in their sponsorship of this ball. 
By the time I arrived the Diamond Theme Display, and the Guards <tag>Band</> and Marching Display, had already taken place. 

700292
A gig which saw The Smiths performing as a five-piece for the last time. 
Amidst accusations that Marr had used Craig Gannon to rockify the band, The Smiths dispensed with Gannon almost immediately after the curtain fell in Manchester. 
It would have been nice, however, if the <tag>band</> had informed Gannon of the decision to fire him before the rumours spread through the Mancunian underground.   

700293
From pop to waltz, slow to disco, there's music to set your feet tapping in most HCI Clubs. 
Some offer live music from resident <tag>bands</> or guest artistes, and you can round off the evening with disco dancing in the nightclub.  

700294
`Like, we know The Wedding Present and Dave Gedge has told me before that he's jealous of us cos we can go off on tangents and do our own thing without losing an audience." 
Perhaps not surprisingly, Cud feel their increasing popularity is due to the prevailing attitude of punters who desire a good night out rather than a drubbing from a <tag>band</> preaching a university thesis.   

700295
For amazing pictures, take your camera up the recently opened Fleckalm gondola; the view is simply stunning. 
In Kirchberg, small flower-decked open air cafes, are dotted about, and we defy anyone not to be tempted by the gateaux on offer. 
Kirchberg is well known locally for its <tag>band</> and throughout the season they stage many concerts ranging from the serene to good old thigh slapping and yodelling nights out.   

700296
She might have been any age between thirty and sixty and Wexford set the lower limit so low only because of her young children. 
Her hair was thin and fair and long, caught back with an elastic <tag>band</>, and her face was thin and long too, wizened and pinched.   

700297
Watch out for the television reports of her activities. 
As the fireworks explode and the <tag>bands</> play, see if you can lip read how she explains to the President that she wishes that there was nothing to celebrate.   

700298
It is no coincidence that both musics are based on a reworking for electric guitar of the melodies of the thumb-piano, known as likembe in central Africa and mbira in the south. 
Three years ago a minor Harare <tag>band</>, the Bhundu Boys, became stars in their own country by the novel means of conquering the UK club circuit first, and there is no shortage of talented compatriots who would dearly love to follow them.   

700299
At least here West's spades were good, if few in number. 
THE WHO will be 25 years old next month, and not one of the <tag>band</> looks a day over 50.

To their credit, Rhino Bucket's tunes aren't straight cops, with the exception of `Train Ride", which is, for a minute at least, `Ride On". 
Kingdom Come stopped aping Led Zeppelin after that infamous first album. 
They turned out to be a good power-rock <tag>band</> doomed by personality clashes and their own audacity. 

700301
The Smiths, although already troubled by contradictions, still TRY to hold true to those early values. 
They just could be the first <tag>band</> in history to sell genuine English music to the Americans.   

700302
Though Man of Straw is a fine achievement in itself, when the company frees that kind of imagination more, (and perhaps employs a writer), it will be a major force. 
As usual the Final Concert of the annual Chipping Norton Music Festival demonstrated amply the wealth of musical talent apparent in North Oxfordshire, ranging from young instrumentalists at the very outset of their training, to accomplished adult amateurs. 
From the generous selection of `outstanding entries" picked from a week's busy music-making and presented at Saturday night's concert, the following must be mentioned: Sibford School <tag>band's</> imaginative Street Conversations, depicting a day in the life of a street; Peter Crowther's sensitive cello account of Faure's Apres un Reve; Chipping Norton Male Voice Choir's stunning version of Seventy-six Trombones from The Music Man; and Richard Dixon's sunny and exotic reading of Walton's Bagatelle No 2 for guitar.   

700303

700304
He was continuously invited to festivals throughout the world. 
Although his power diminished slightly in the Eighties, his playing on tour this year showed that he retained his good taste and was still able to hold that commanding lead over a <tag>band</> that had always so distinguished him (as witnessed by the records they made together in the late Forties, he was the only trumpet-player who could contain the otherwise unsuppressible Sidney Bechet).   

700305
The resulting hype. which was to last six months, made the `Reel Around The Fountain" accusations seem trivial by comparison. 
A strange looking <tag>band</> named Bronski Beat began to state a national case for gay equality.

700309
The effect is laid-back but insistent, and very more-ish; as the press release states coyly, Cumbias are `Colombia's Most Addictive Export". 
It's the surface textures that set Cumbia music apart, trombones and clarinets combining with guitars in a manner akin to a Mexican mariachi <tag>band</>, whilst occasional button-accordion adds further hints of Tex-Mex and Cajun styles. 

700310
Destroyed a few 17-year olds' ambitions for a while, I can tell you." 
Five Thirty's ambitions were rekindled earlier this year when the <tag>band</> (still essentially the same &dash.

Tonight Southampton Joiners Arms.

Having mastered several rudimentary flams, paradiddles and ruffs on my newly purchased drum-kit, I can put up quite a satisfactory backbeat to our kid's efforts on the keyboard. 
In 10 years' time, when he is 17 and I am 53 (just fractionally older than Charlie Watts today) we should be ready to hit the road together as Lyndon &and. Lyndon, the world's last pub <tag>band</> still specialising in Eddie Cochran hits like `Somethin' Else" and `Summertime Blues" (the boy will probably have some views about the running order of the show and may want something more modern than hits nearly half a century old but, as long as I am paying for the instruments, he can keep his opinions to himself).   

700320
He takes over from Jackie Hinde who is leaving to become manager of the Empire Theatre in Liverpool.
