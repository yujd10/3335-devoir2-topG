Topically tropical  BUT GEARED UP FOR OUR CLIMATE! 
THE BRITISH climate can be notoriously fickle, so these models are prepared for anything &dash. rain or shine. 
In <tag>brilliant</> shades of lime green and hot pink this beachwear is just the job for the recent heatwave which we've been enjoying.

That was an isolated miscalculation. 
On the whole, it was a very <tag>brilliant</> Carnaval, but a rather chilly one.

The holes in Kapoor's blocks of stone are extraordinary, so pitch dark even in ordinary daylight that you wonder for a moment whether they might have been painted on: peering into them you find darkness made visible, a black, black void housed in solid matter. 
Angel has the opposite effect, presenting something that you know to be solid yet making it insubstantial, shrouding it in a blue so <tag>brilliant</> that it seems to shift and float in space.

Jansher did contribute to a phase of magnificent squash in a second game lasting nearly half an hour. 
For a while the familiar pattern of probing and testing, interspersed with sudden attack and <tag>brilliant</> counter-attacks, manifested itself.   

700015
I saw Victor and Masha engaging attractive women in talk; for myself, I felt that `remoteness" and `stand-offishness" which is often a prelude to some creative idea. 
And it was not slow in coming, imprecisely at first, then more concretely: a way of developing and concluding the story of the Charskys which struck me (at the moment) as <tag>brilliant</>.   

700016
But now this marvellous old war horse has run out of puff, and it ia sad to see it. 
Maybe it is a fact that trilogies never work: Future Shock was a <tag>brilliant</> exposition of new thinking; The Third Wave was a superb consolidation of it.

By then she will be 23 years old. 
The Florida schoolgirl is what the Americans term a `phenom", and the expectation is that she will soon challenge Steffi Graf, the <tag>brilliant</> West German who has won everything possible and is considered `middle-aged" at 20.

Swindon BR appeared to have set Thame a tough target when they scored 200-5 after half-centuries from Paul Womersley (52), Anton Bush (52) and Peter Elliott (51no). 
But Thame sped to a thrilling nine wicket victory with three balls to spare thanks to a <tag>brilliant</> 111 not out from Keith Hopkinson.

At the Sunday sale of shares and nominations a share in Nureyev, a son of Northern Dancer, made top price of $825,000 against $910,000 a year ago and a share in Danzig $780,000 against $940,000.

As the end of term approached, Victoria's tutor wrote to her family and suggested that she needed to go home and stay there until she had recovered. 
Martha's tutor bluntly threatened to send her down and made bitchy observations about Commonwealth scholarship students who wasted opportunities which thousands of more worthy candidates would have seized. 
Jo's tutor, who had already dismissed her as a <tag>brilliant</> girl determined to waste herself as an actress, marvelled at her ability to skimp reading, sleep through lectures and turn in essays which were more original and better constructed than the work of her conscientious fellows.

It was in 1976, too, that Hedlund left his seat in Parliament.

Such recognition may have come as a shock to Robinson, but it was no surprise to the country's young fashion editors.

You can go kayaking for one day, three days or a week, and for most of the year you can do white-water rafting too, either on the Zambian side with Sobec or on the Zimbabwean side with Shearwater.

Stoute has stated that Cordoba's Guineas odds are absurdly low, but there is no doubt that he holds the colt in extremely high regard. 
On actual racecourse achievement, Rock City is head and shoulders above Cordoba and the rest of today's field, having won Royal Ascot's Coventry Stakes and the Gimcrack Stakes at York. 
However, Rock City looked a shadow of the <tag>brilliant</> juvenile who dominated those events when a well-beaten fourth behind the French colt Machiavellian at Longchamp.

There were princes, dukes, earls, and counts. 
There were plenipotentiaries in court uniforms so decked with gold that their coats seemed like sheets of light. 
There were jewelled stars and enamelled crosses worn on sashes of <tag>brilliant</> silk, and all lit by the glittering chandeliers which had been hoisted to the ceiling with their burdens of fine white candles.

He had bought it from Sir Thomas Parry, Controller of the Royal Household, who had managed to survive through the reigns of Edward VI, Mary and finally her sister, to be rewarded with a knighthood. 
He was a Member of Parliament and, according to popular report, died `of mere ill-humour" &dash. bad temper.

With Elsworth keen to extend his sphere of influence in Flat racing, speculation has been rife for some time that he would be training for the Maktoums and yesterday he confirmed that he is to be sent two two year olds owned by Sheikh Ahmed. 
It had been whispered that Sheikh Mohammed, who has dominated the owners' table in recent seasons, would be the first of the family to patronise Elsworth, but while that may well happen soon it is Sheikh Mohammed's younger brother, owner of the <tag>brilliant</> middle-distance colt Mtoto, who will spearhead the latest Maktoum manoeuvre with a colt by Dancing Brave and a filly by Kris. 

700031
The tragedy was that O'Nolan no longer had the confidence to build on his success. 
By the late 1940s he had already fallen victim to the Dublin literary world, where the <tag>brilliant</> failures deride and mock their betters.

Rachel's friends had, as usual, been charming.

His request, not surprisingly, was greeted with some indifference.

But Botham the batsman got his own back.

The current spell of fine weather is starting to worry Malton trainer John Parkes, who has issued a warning that Call Collect will not run at Aintree if the going becomes firm by Saturday.

Simply, Wilson knows more about his subject than anyone in the country, and one approaches his book with mixed feelings, in case it should prove that Hamlet was really just a sad, ordinary man. 
In respect of their hero's public careers, at least, Lawrentians need feel no fear: though Wilson scotches for good some of the wilder apocrypha (Lawrence being assassinated by the British secret service and so on), the public man emerges from these soberly written pages in <tag>brilliant</> colours.

We accepted drinks. 
I saw Masha gliding through towards us: that unmistakable froth of brown hair, the exuberant, doll-like face; and behind her, over-topping her, the bleak, dark face of Victor Surkov, his hair not grey as it had been when we last met some six years ago, but a <tag>brilliant</> yellow spreading down over his shoulders. 

700042
Now, for the same publishers, `Tyson", is a biog as gruesomely riveting and unpleasantly, painfully clinical as a legalised assault by its subject in the ring.

700043
C. S. Lewis has become a mythological figure, and it has therefore seemed legitimate to some to retell his story without too much regard for empirical evidence, just as poets have told and retold the tales of Greek or Norse mythology. 
A good example of this was the <tag>brilliant</> television play Shadowlands by Bill Nicholson, subsequently written up by Brian Sibley as a book, which tells the story of C. S. Lewis's marriage to Joy Davidman.

The doctrine, evolved by the Jews and developed most fully in Christianity, that God is One, and that He made and loved the world, is imaginatively extremely hard to hold on to. 
Lewis's imagination had a naturally dualistic tendency, which was why he was so <tag>brilliant</> at dreaming up letters from the Devil.

You'll never be merely that.

It will set back the public status of abduction research for years," Mike Wooton, the editor of the UFO Times concluded solemnly at the post-show party. 
It was an odd thing to say (it wouldn't matter if the film was <tag>brilliant</> &dash. it would still probably provoke mirth among non-believers), but then it was alos an odd thing to see in a film which was presumably trying to revamp the alien invasion genre for a new age, because it was such a throwback to the cinematic aliens of the last few years.

For most of the game between Bristol and Coventry the play was, to quote one contemporary news report, `fast and often furious", an exciting (if you like that sort of thing) ding-dong battle. 
Some <tag>brilliant</> goals from both sides had seen to it that the score was 2-all by the eightieth minute of the match.

Horbury has come up with `There's a lot of Glasgowing on in 1990". 
`Our research shows," he says, `that people are put off by the word `culture" so we're presenting it as entertainment, featuring pop groups and Russian pole vaulters on the posters. 
`Up till three years ago people thought they would be mugged as they stepped off the trains; 1990 is a <tag>brilliant</> opportunity to tell people about Glasgow, to convert people, so it becomes exponential self-sustaining growth."

They see themselves not as author and illustrator, with separate roles, but as a partnership of `book-makers", contributing equally to the process. 
Allan Ahlberg says: `In the past, a lot of children's books seemed to be the work of talented illustrators whose pictures looked <tag>brilliant</> framed in a gallery, but when you tried to read the book, there was nothing there, because the words started as a coat-hanger to hang pictures on."

Dancing Brave, Indian Skimmer and Warning have all failed miserably to live up to their hype, to the poorly disguised glee of the Americans.

Lush's large audience, most of whom chatter blithely through the sensitive acoustic numbers, seem to agree.

So many ideas are quickly translated into a flowing movement that end like bursting bubbles within sight of the goal. 
Mark Hughes, amazingly named as one of United's top 10 post-war players in a recent book, (no Dennis Viollet, Roger Byrne nor Tommy Taylor!) is the major culprit. 
<tag>Brilliant</> as he is at scoring explosive and spectacular goals his approach to goal, and finishing on the run, is sometimes almost amateurish.

Michael rested his eyes upon it with relief. 
The sky was a steady blue, washing paler towards the horizons, and a line of small rotund clouds was stretched above the trees which secluded the Abbey from view.

ENGLAND will not produce a boy prodigy like India's Sachim Tendulkar until the structure of this country's youth cricket is radically overhauled. 
That's the view of England manager Micky Stewart, who was at Chesterfield yesterday to see 17-year-old Tendulkar hit a <tag>brilliant</> 105 not out to guide India to a two wicket victory over Derbyshire.

Featherstone Rovers ended a seven-match losing run with a hard-earned 36-18 victory at Trafford Borough of the Second Division. 
Trailing 10-6 at half time an upset was on the cards but two quick tries in the second half from Trevor Clarke and Gary Price settled the affair. 
A <tag>brilliant</> second-half display saw New Zealand defeat France 34-0 in their second Test in Carcassonne yesterday.

From this research came a new generation of tough, heat-resistant ceramics that do not corrode under extreme conditions.

His work comes down more on the side of abstraction than figuration, though the most interesting paintings combine both. 
The Reunion and Report both have an echo of Chagall and the pipers, circus figures and gladiators that lurk among the <tag>brilliant</> swirls of colour conjure up a pleasing world of masque and  commedia d'ell arte pantomime.

America was underwhelmed. 
It vaguely remembered the <tag>brilliant</> child gymnast Nadia once was &dash. the elfin figure with a dark prettiness that promised to bloom into beauty.

Hazlitt, whose essay on Byron is one of the best things he wrote, says that whatever Byron did, `he must do in a more decided and daring way than any one else: he lounges with extravagance, and yawns so as to alarm the reader". 
In a <tag>brilliant</> phrase which is usually attributed to others (including Abraham Lincoln) Hazlitt finishes his essay by saying that Byron died in the cause of freedom, `for the last, best hopes of man".

Hollywood's modern-day anti-heroes appeared that year in the shape of John Voight and his smelly companion Dustin Hoffman in the 1969 Oscar-winning film, Midnight Cowboy. 
While that was a <tag>brilliant</> evocation of living by your wits in or near a New York gutter, which pushed out several boundaries &dash. largely sexual &dash. in relation to the old Hollywood code of conduct, there was a degree of tameness in comparison to the anti-heroes created in Easy Rider; Fonda, Hopper and especially Nicholson were used as role models for many future films, and thus it broke new ground.   

700081
Kingsley Amis (The Folks that Live on the Hill), Brian Moore (Lies of Silence) and Mary Wesley (A Sensible Life) will no doubt fill the bookshop windows. 
But some of the most impressive fiction will come, not surprisingly, from abroad. 
Richard Ford's new novel Wildlife is, like the <tag>brilliant</> stories in Rock Springs, set in the small towns and high rims of Montana; Nicholson Baker's Room Temperature explores the philosophical implications of the speed at which puffs of air move around the room, and other life-enhancing domestic inquiries; and Mario Vargas Llosa's new novel The Storyteller describes how a Peruvian in Florence recognises an old friend of his in a painting, and proceeds from there. 

700082
A representative from each travelled to London for a joint interview chaired by Jones, and subsequently published in Melody Maker. 
It was a <tag>brilliant</> tactical move which killed seven birds with one stone, gave The Smiths four pages in Melody Maker and gave the fanzines a slice of national exposure.

UNDER 10 Quarry Rovers gained quick revenge over St Edmunds, who knocked them out of the cup last weekend, with a 1-0 victory. 
Quarry had keeper Aaron Deadman to thank after a <tag>brilliant</> save prevented the Saints taking the lead in the second half and Oliver Doolan hit the winner three minutes into injury time.

700087
In recent years he was often mentioned as a candidate for the Nobel Prize and shortly before his death he was awarded the prestigious Bruno Schulz prize by PEN, the society of poets, editors and novelists. 
This prize was particularly fitting since Schulz, the Polish Jewish short-story writer killed by the Nazis, pointed the way to the sombre themes and expressionist style that Kis later explored. 
Kis's father died at Auschwitz and he himself grew up in Hungary and Yugoslavia first under the Fascists, then under Tito; his writing is a poetic, sometimes witty, always <tag>brilliant</>, response to tyranny of whatever ideological stripe.

The nineteenth century had arrived but not the twentieth, and as for American literature, it might as well not have existed. 
Overall it was a curious, in-between, limbo-like time. 
Many of the giants, like Lewis and Tolkien, had departed and, despite <tag>brilliant</> rising stars on the horizon like Ricks and Carey, no one had really come forward to take their place.   

700092
His review of Karajan's famous Philharmonia recording of Strauss's Don Juan and Till Eulenspiegel &dash. Columbia's first LP on 33CX 1001 &dash. placed Karajan in the Toscanini and Koussevitsky tradition. 
With the Philharmonia wind players at their vaulting, <tag>brilliant</> best, it was a performance which Porter found himself preferring to the mellower and  long-admired Clemens Krauss recordings, which sounded tame by comparison.   

700093
Lewis's natural reaction to any experience was to write it up, or down. 
As he had discovered, with a mixture of joyful shock and embarrassment (`What an ass I have been"), this often led to a curious effect of unreality, as in the case of his over-eager desire to defend religious positions which he had really only fallen in love with from the outside, before learning what it was like to live them. 
A Grief Observed, as he came to call the jottings which he made from almost the moment Joy died, has an almost novelistic quality from its <tag>brilliant</> first sentence &dash. `No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear."

Best of a full but not very dis tinguished rental month (the blockbusters are coming in November, leading with Rain Man, Roger Rabbit, Dangerous Liaisons and Mississippi Burning) is Parents (18 Vestron), which is simultaneously both scary and funny. 
From the start of this modest but compelling chiller, you sense that the family, moving to suburban Indiana in 1958, has got a skewed and sinister undertow. 
Just how black isn't fully apparent until about half-way through, when you discover that the glum little son (a <tag>brilliant</> performance by a child, Bryan Madorsky) of the happy couple (Randy Quaid and Mary Beth Hurt) has a great deal to be disturbed about.

Charterhouse Estates is buying the site but will be paying a percentage of profits to the city council. 
IN TONIGHT'S Building Sights (BBC2 10.20pm), Edward Cullinan, one of the Prince of Wales's favourite Modern architects, revisits a building that the Prince could surely never begin to love: the Royal College of Physicians, Regent's Park, designed by Sir Denys Lasdun before he began work on Britain's most phenomenal celebration of brute concrete, the National Theatre. 
Cullinan, a brick man himself, sees the Royal College of Physicians as `a very, very good building from a much derided period" and, very unfashionably, claims that Lasdun's building enhances rather than debases John Nash's <tag>brilliant</> plan for Regent's Park.

Clive Condie, of Hazel Grove, warned that the unpopularity of a system, under which his area subsidised high-spending neighbours like Labour Rochdale, could cost the Conservatives marginal seats like Hazel Grove.

The Prince played the baryton, a multi-stringed, bowed and plucked relative of the cello and it is no mere coincidence that Haydn wrote more pieces (175) for this obscure instrument than he did for any other.

If any one theme emerged from the festival, particularly during a two-day Shakespeare seminar, it was the old conflict between directorial concepts and an actor-oriented theatre: my own view is that it is a largely phoney war since the best directors produce the best performances. 
You could also not have had a better vindication of conceptual theatre than Roberto Ciulli's amazing production of The Threepenny Opera from the Theatre on the Ruhr in Muelheim. 
This was based on the idea that Brecht's equation of criminal and bourgeois society may have been politically subversive in 1928 but was now a commonplace: what we saw was a <tag>brilliant</> piece of theatrical deconstruction in which the Brecht-Weill classic was played as an ironic, tacky, twenties vaudeville with the immortal, sawn-off tunes being pumped out by a raffish band against a background of beer-advertisements.

The encounter was so utterly unexpected, the resemblance so close and striking, that Michael had been speechless and had had to sit down and feign a momentary sickness. 
He had lost sight of Nick completely during the years that followed their severance, though without seeking it he had heard occasional news of him: that he had read mathematics at Oxford, and though thought to be <tag>brilliant</> had missed getting his first, that he had taken a post in aero-dynamic research, but had left this very soon after, when he inherited some money, and bought a share in a syndicate at Lloyds.

`All right, John, I know that I know that. 
But I must confess that I did permit myself to convey the impression that another <tag>brilliant</> Gower novel was ready for the publisher."   

700192
He would surely have done everything in his power, however, to prevent an absurd scene change in the middle of the second act. 
After all, what is the point of writing an expressive aria for his main character, the pretended gardener of the title herself, if Anne Dawson is directed to sing it in front of a curtain while the stage crew moves in behind it and makes so much noise as to reduce the audience to tears of embarrassed laughter? 
A serious miscalculation on the part of Tim Albery and his designer, Tom Cairns, it is compounded by the fact that what they are doing behind the curtain is little less than striking the set and laying it down on its side &dash. which isn't a conspicuously <tag>brilliant</> idea. 

700193
Glover grinned: `I ran him at Ayr just to freshen him up. 
And I got on at 50-1 immediately after that race, and had a fair bet.

KATE SAUNDERS Charles Palliser's The Quincunx (Canongate #14.95) was easily the most entertaining read of the year, and at half a million words it was certainly the longest. 
This crowded epic is a <tag>brilliant</> pastiche of an early Victorian novel, and the sheer eccentricity of the whole enterprise adds to its charm. 

700196
So, you're putting her on hold, yes, so you can put your handset down. 
Right, if you can leave your handset at the side, you can  see that it matures after 75 seconds, <tag>brilliant</>.

Pakistan's method of scoring five and a half runs an over was to start off at five and a half an over and keep it there. 
Rameez Raja's approach to the first 10 overs in Calcutta was much the same as it was for the last 10 at Nagpur and Salim Malik (71 off 61 balls) also played another <tag>brilliant</>, if not quite so violent, innings. 

700199
My father was valedictorian. 
He and my mother left the reputation of being the most <tag>brilliant</> graduates of the university to that time.

Having begun their Courage First Division programme with a 29-12 home win over Leicester, Wasps then lost direction and the match when they took on Harlequins at The Stoop. 
On the same day, Gloucester stole a march by beating the champions, Bath, at Kingsholm in a fierce encounter during which another England prop, Bath's Gareth Chilcott, was sent off for punching. 
Meanwhile, news concerning Mike Teague &dash. the Gloucester back row forward who in South Africa aggravated a shoulder injury which had caused him problems during the Lions tour of Australia &dash. is not <tag>brilliant</>.   

700201
For the officers of the order, however, it presented certain problems. 
They were inclined individually and as a group to label rather different phenomena as miraculous: for example, the fact that the saint had had little formal education but is supposed to have had a <tag>brilliant</> and precocious knowledge of math and Persian; or that when challenged by the &backquote.ulema to prove his religious credentials by answering certain extremely difficult theological questions, he replied by setting them a question that none of them could answer.

If it is a popular tune, its spread through the meme pool may be gauged by the number of people heard whistling it in the streets. 
If it is a style of women's shoe, the population memeticist may use sales statistics from shoe shops. 
Some memes, like some genes, achieve <tag>brilliant</> short-term success in spreading rapidly, but do not last long in the meme pool. 

700204
Scorsese's description of his upbringing and career has been tailored into a continuous narrative; the editors supply relevant facts, but some interrogative probing would not have gone amiss. 
Scorsese admits to a strict diet of cinema; his technical devices and moral references alike are drawn from years of movie-going and little else ('I grew up in a house without books'). 
There are <tag>brilliant</> details here &dash. imagine Harvey Keitel, in Mean Streets, walking backwards joined to the camera by a brace &dash. and one's only regret is that the editors, entranced by scandal, spend too much time on The Last Temptation of Christ. 

700205
The erudition in this book is monumental but reflections on Kafka or Freud are always undercut with some bizarre observation: the supermarket in Romania, for example, where gypsies are poking at a pile of brassieres that `look still warm from use". 
I thoroughly enjoyed Christopher Hope's My Chocolate Redeemer (Heinemann #10.95), a grotesque fairy tale sired out of Mervyn Peake and Roald Dahl with a satirical nod in the direction of Evelyn Waugh. 
The main character, memorably christened the `Beast of Zang", is a <tag>brilliant</> composite of Big Dada Amin, Baby Doc and the Emperor Bokassa.

Pakistan, completing their 10th game in 16 days and having performed all afternoon like a side keener to put their feet up than qualify for yet another game of cricket, found themselves requiring an improbable 95 with only 60 deliveries remaining, and cantered in off only 51. 
Rameez Raja and Salim Malik annihilated a combination of Derek Pringle, Phillip DeFreitas, Gladstone Small and Angus Fraser with a <tag>brilliant</> exhibition of controlled hitting, and poor old Angus disappeared for 43 runs in 18 deliveries. 

700207
The American champion relied on him implicitly for club selection. 
After setting an Open championship tournament record 283, Sarazen said it was because he had had the sense to listen to his caddie at every tricky point through the tournament, calling Daniels' club selection `<tag>brilliant</>", and his understanding of Sarazen's sometimes less-than-cautious temperament uncanny. 

700208
The next day there were more semi-finals. 
In the Van Cliburn Cafe&acute., people whispered to one another that Pedro Burmester was a sure favourite, that Jean-Efflam Bavouzet had redeemed a poor recital with a <tag>brilliant</> performance with the Tokyo String Quartet, that the Russians would win, that Benedetto Lupo was a talent of incredible scale, that the Chinese lacked passion. 

700209
The events are presented in episodic form, as a continuous narrative tossed antiphonally to and fro between the actresses. 
This was the method pioneered in the RSC's Nicholas Nickleby but, in contrast to that <tag>brilliant</> tapestry, the effect here is one of relentless monotony.

She can now go wherever she wants, read whatever she wants &ellip

But to us he had been and remained something of a hero. 
Outside the NHS it is unlikely that many people knew his name, but his work affected and improved the lives of literally millions.

Given Michael Frayn's prowess as a playwright, this is undoubtedly true. 
Renowned for the highly successful Noises Off, Donkey's Years, Benefactors and Alphabetical Order, plus his <tag>brilliant</> translations of Chekhov (Uncle Vanya, The Cherry Orchard, Three Sisters), the Aldwych audience is in good hands.

For reasons best known to himself &dash. off-field orders or tactical naivety on it Stephens, despite a flood of possession, produced a wasteful exhibition of kicking. 
While Ring has a battle to recapture his grace and cunning, Stephens, with years on his side at this level, has still to harness his <tag>brilliant</> potential.   

700216
For instance, I had never noticed before that women almost always close phone calls by saying the word `Bye!" a semitone higher than the rest of the conversation.

Noam's infatuation had provided the explanation for his mistaken regard for me. 
His besotted perception had wrapped me in an intellectual grace and loveliness. 
His interpretation of my remarks had been generous, often creatively so, making of them something far more <tag>brilliant</> than I had intended, than I ever could intend.

(Halikarnas, as all classical scholars will know was the ancient name for Bodrum). 
Here in a vast amphitheatre you can dance the night away to a <tag>brilliant</> light and laser show, a stage show, and fountains shooting straight out of the sea, with the floodlit backdrop of Bodrum castle across the far side of the harbour.

The Lieutenant's horse was tossing its head, snorting, raising its bright hooves high as it trampled the crop. 
Husks of rye and scraps of straw were being splintered aside by the charging horse. 
The Lieutenant's sabre was raised, reflecting the dying sun in its <tag>brilliant</> polish and ready for the downwards cut that was supposed to hack into Sharpe's skull.

Day produced a <tag>brilliant</> save to tip a shot by Paul Simpson onto the bar, though the keeper was lucky that the ball bounced kindly into his arms as he picked himself up off the ground.

He had, from another discipline, sought out the secrets of hers, knowing what he did not know, humble and loving. 
She had spent her adolescence in the company of eminent old men; eminent old men who received her respect as their due and enjoyed teaching the <tag>brilliant</> daughter of their colleague.  

700227
The winning goal, after 40 minutes, came from Barnsley's first corner swung over by Paul Cross. 
Paul Kee &dash. who has had something of an up-and-down month with a bizaare, comical goal conceded at Portsmouth followed by <tag>brilliant</> saves against Swindon and then an international call-up &dash. must have thought about coming to collect the corner.   

700228
I can remember a party dress that I loved &dash. a white one with bright, tiny flowers on and lace trimming.

Koons himself inspires great unease and deeply ambivalent feelings. 
In the course of a long interview in his apartment, I found myself quite charmed by his lack of pretension, inarticulate babble sprinkled with the occasionally <tag>brilliant</> observation and odd habit of quoting himself, but I nevertheless remained convinced that Koons' self-effacing earnestness was a scam.   

700234
It was more the manner of victory. 
With Baresi conducting and Donadoni the orchestra leader, Azeglio Vicini's players responded to the PA system's temerity in preceding the match with Strauss waltzes by improvising a <tag>brilliant</> Italian caprice.   

700235
That allowed the scrum-half David Wright to pepper the Cardiff defence with a succession of up and unders for the home side, while the visitors preferred to use their back-line cunning to make ground.

Even the <tag>brilliant</> Warburgs must be under some threat.

He came to the famous Crockford's preface of 1987, which attacked what the author saw as the self-perpetuating liberal establishment of the Church of England and its General Synod; said the House of Bishops was characterised by deference, patronage, and self-recruitment; and had a hack at the Archbishops of Canterbury and York for their part in all this, saying they were men who had nothing to prevent them following what they thought was the wish of the majority at the moment. 
It was a <tag>brilliant</> and resounding polemic.

Professor James believes that the main changes are going to come from prevention and that improving our diet is the surest way to lower the risk of heart disease. 
`If you have a <tag>brilliant</> medical service you can save three to five per cent of people, but management of heart disease has barely changed since the '50s. Our health problems are actually related to lack of health promotions and prevention schemes."

However, the cathedral commission insisted on a conventional cruciform plan for St Paul's &dash. and a steeple rather than a dome.
