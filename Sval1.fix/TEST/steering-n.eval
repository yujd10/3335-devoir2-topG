700001
Just don't say it, that's all!" 
Her hands flew up in horror then slammed down on the <tag>steering</> wheel.   

700003
A vertical accelerometer detects the roughness of the road surface. 
The more impressive feat of reading the driver's mind is managed by determining whether his foot is on the throttle or the brake, and the rate at which the <tag>steering</> wheel is being swivelled.   

700005
Moreover, the quality of much of the facia and control plastic was rather hard and crudely textured. 
That said, the car felt extremely solid and well screwed together, exterior panel gaps were uniformly narrow and even and all the doors shut with a satisfying `thunk". 
Not famed for generosity when drawing up standard equipment lists, BMW has nevertheless seen fit to provide the SE with power <tag>steering</>, alloy wheels, electric front windows, central locking and tinted glass.   

700006
`She is so thin," the man observed in a soft, concerned voice. 
He leaned forward over the <tag>steering</> wheel to see his way through a deep pot-hole in the road.   

700007
Head rests which can be moved backwards and forwards as well as up and down. 
Bright interior lights with a sensibly long courtesy delay. 
The soft-feel <tag>steering</> wheel has a lever which tilts it up out of the way to give you an extra bit of room when boarding.  

700010
It's a strong performer in the mid-ranges, sporty in feel, yet pleasantly hushed on the motorway. 
Both Rover and Honda use a new power steering set-up, called `positive centre-feel" (PCF). 
The advantage of this system is that it eliminates the slightly vague feeling around the straight ahead position, which curses many other power <tag>steering</> set-ups. 

700011
It made him feel better when he heard Smallfry mention the book, the special album in which they kept all the photographs of him wearing his best clothes and doing nice things. 
There was a big picture of him dressed in a fancy cowboy suit and Stetson hat, riding the pony Buddie had bought from a circus because it wouldn't allow the big men to ride on its back. 
There were lots of smaller snapshots of him sitting astride Trigger, or propped on cushions behind the <tag>steering-wheel</> of Buddie's truck, or standing in the garden in his very smartest clothes.   

700012
The sophistication of modern four-wheel-drive vehicles leads to comparisons of specification which might equally apply to top of the range saloons. 
Power <tag>steering</>, electric windows, sunroof, four-speaker electronically tuned stereo and headlamp washers are all standard on the stylish Fourtrak Estate.   

700013
Islamic Jihad has claimed responsibility for other apparently individual acts of terrorism. 
The unnamed man grabbed the <tag>steering</> wheel of an express bus on the busy Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway and sent it plunging into a deep gorge where it burst into flames.   

700014
But the Merc 420Se, due to be replaced by the new S-class, can still take on all comers and hold its own. 
Over-large <tag>steering</> wheel notwithstanding, its controls, instruments, heating and ventilation system, and driving position simply show how it should be done.   

700015
The new car has an exceptionally low nose, with fixed slim wraparound headlamps and shallow air intakes above and below the main bumper line. 
A steeply-raked windscreen, wedge profile with smooth wrap-round sides and semi-flush side glass completely covering the B-pillars gives the Calibra its distinctive appearance, which is enhanced by the frameless doorglass and aditional lower sill mouldings on the 16v version. 
Comprehensive standard specification on all models includes power-assisted <tag>steering</>, central door locking with security deadlocks, electric front windows with `one touch" operation, and an electric tilt-and-slide steel sunroof. 

700017
There are 1.6 and 2 litre models in three and five-door hatchback form, plus four-door saloons. 
I rate the 1.6 litres best value for money, because they are well-balanced and refined, with a high level of specification  (power <tag>steering</>, adjustable steering column and twin-speaker radio-cassette unit are standard even on the basic L versions). the 150 bhp 2-litre ZX is the fast and handy sports variation but it costs around #17,000, whereas the 1.6S is in the #10,000 to #12,000 bracket.   

700018
Both V16s were withdrawn because of a gearbox problem in practice. 
`I stayed at Monza after the race to run a test programme," says Rudd, `and learned a great deal while Piero Taruffi, Stirling Moss and Ken Wharton drove the car, I remembered Freddie Dixon's observations, in his book on building Rileys, about sorting out suspension and chassis stiffness, so I followed some of his ideas because of Moss's complaints about the diabolical steering. 
I found I could force the <tag>steering</> wheel a quarter of a turn and flex all sorts of things, like the casting for the gearbox mounting." 

700022
Though a little languid at low revs, a trait of multi-valve engines, the GT is a fast and willing revver which doesn't suffer the high-rev harshness of some 16- valvers. 
This encourages you to use the engine hard and exploit its strength in the mid-range to top-end of its performance band. 
The power <tag>steering</>, fitted as standard to the GT, is a bonus around town and at parking speeds, but along winding B-roads it does not pass back enough information about the road, which means the Mazda is less rewarding to hustle along than, say, a Golf GTi.   

700023
To me, the Swedish cars built like tanks are the ideal vehicle. 
OK, so they are a little bit on the heavy side, but the power <tag>steering</> makes them easily manoeuvrable and when it comes to safety, they are second to none. 

700024
Indeed, first impression tells you that the new car's chassis feels a little less sharp and agile than its predecessor's. 
Subtle, wrist-generated steering inputs don't do as much. 
THe <tag>steering</> is slightly heavier but more damped, too.   

700025
I loved every minute of it, even when the end hung out a bit on a tight right hander, due more to over-enthusiasm on the slippery, diesel-doused, Grecian road surface than any fault of the car. 
High back bucket seats with integral head rests are comfortable and supportive, modelled on those of an earlier Alfa Romeo Spider. 
Behind the three-spoke leather trimmed Momo <tag>steering</> wheel the glare-free instruments are simple and clear.   

700026
Remote though this area can be, even the minor roads are generally good, although we once had to switch the Citroe&umlaut.n's self-levelling suspension to HIGH to increase ground clearance through a ford. 
And soon afterwards we were grateful for its responsive power <tag>steering</> and generous reserves of torque (perfect for those 1:5 hills) to take the climb up Winnat's Pass with ease.   

700027
The exhaust system, tyres and brake pads or shoes are not covered by the Motorlife policy. 
The company says the policy protects the owner against repairs to lights, <tag>steering</>, the braking system, suspension components, the electrical system and the vehicle structure.   

700028
Paint finishes, panel fit and interior fit and finish are all of a standard expected from this price range. 
The Corrado feels subjectively as though it is screwed together just a little more tightly but neither car suffers from rattles or shakes. 
As expected, the level of standard equipment on both is high &dash. alloy wheels, electric sunroof, power windows, mirrors and <tag>steering</>, central locking, a radio-cassette and anti-lock brakes.   

700029
Cumani, unlike many of his counterparts in the vanguard of British trainers, has not given the Cheveley Park saturation coverage in the past. 
His last runner, in 1985, was Embla, who won in the hands of Angel Cordero. 
The man entrusted with the <tag>steering</> this year is Ray Cochrane, who proved that 20 days on the sidelines had not dulled either his skills or competitive edge when driving home a double at Wolverhampton on Monday, his first day back, and adding another winner yesterday.   

700032
The package is voluntary and staff are being asked to comment on it to chief officers. 
RESCUE services from Scotland and Ireland co-operated early today in an operation to snatch four fishermen from a 65-foot vessel in danger of sinking in a violent storm off the north-west Irish coast. 
The men had drifted for more than nine hours in seas whipped by 75mph winds after a wave wrecked <tag>steering</> and communication equipment. 

700033
Both turbocharged and intercooled, the new #11,950 Fiesta RS Turbo develops 133 horsepower and accelerates form 0-60mph in 7.7 seconds. 
It has high ratio <tag>steering</>, bonnet extractor vents for additional engine cooling, a rear mounted roof spoiler and special 14 inch alloy wheels.   

700034
There are other anomalies with supposedly superior models, too. 
The GLX I drove, again fully loaded with options including anti-lock brakes, had a firm brake pedal and Ford's cleverly adjusting <tag>steering</> column &dash. two items the S could certainly do with. 

700035
`We might even stay the night," he said, having a twofold thought &dash. one the pleasure of such an event and the other the glaring fact that we were taking our lives in our hands by being out at all. 
There was a certain bravura in the way he went with the skids, allowing the car, like a wilful animal, to pursue its own course and then patting the <tag>steering</> wheel when things settled down again.   

700036
It, it, it. 
Vic's knuckles are white as he grips the <tag>steering</> wheel.   

700037
Peak power is delivered at 5750rpm, well into the `warning zone" and only 750rpm short of the point where the rev-limiter cuts in. 
Not that many drivers will want to push it that far; beyond 4000rpm the 1.4 Energy unit is distinctly thrashy. 
Despite anti-roll bars front and rear the Clio leans quickly in bends, and by Renault standards the <tag>steering</> is low geared and not as communicative as the Renault 5's.   

700038
A pet dog bit off the head of a sleeping three-week-old baby, Hamburg police said yesterday. 
The dog &dash. a giant deerhound &dash. was destroyed. 
The US, bowing to pressure from Israel, yesterday branded as terrorism a bus crash in which 14 people were killed when a Palestinian grabbed the <tag>steering</> wheel, sending the vehicle off a cliff. 

700039
The GLX I drove, again fully loaded with options including anti-lock brakes, had a firm brake pedal and Ford's cleverly adjusting steering column &dash. two items the S could certainly do with. 
But not the manual steering, which again has such an effect on the driving character of the car that it is impossible to overlook. 
This is <tag>steering</> that manages the seemingly impossible: to be bad just about everywhere.   

700041
The standard specification does include, however, high quality deck hardware, blocks and winches. 
The icebox is refrigerated and the sinks and wash hand basins are served with pressure hot and cold fresh water. 
Shore power is standard and the rim of the <tag>steering</> wheel is hide covered.   

700042
The trade-off is a shortage of feel and increase in weight when driving quickly. 
It's not until the front tyres are struggling for adhesion, and screaming in anguish as the nose slithers round, that the Dodge's <tag>steering</> imparts any sensation of what's happening down at road level. 

700045
For the rest of the 1950s he regularly made the British team; he was eighth in the 1955 world championship four-man bobsleigh event and tenth in the two-man bob race at the Olympic Games at Cortina d'Ampezzo in 1956. 
He cut a striking figure, often competing in a long black astrakhan overcoat, its tails tucked between his knees and <tag>steering</> wheel.   

700048
Be wary of an example that does not give you a quiet, rattle-free and largely uneventful ride. 
Always bear in mind that a clonking gearbox, rattling engine and sloppy <tag>steering</> are all expensive to remedy.   

700049
It has smooth up-market looks and the sleek bonnet line of the five-door, liftback, flows round to a rounded rear-end with a small, rear spoiler which adds a sporty air. 
Any shape or size of driver should be able to make themselves at ease with seven-position, tilt-adjustable, <tag>steering</>, seat cushion height adjustment and lever-controlled lumbar support.   

700050
When he looked round it was rolling backwards with James still in the passenger seat. 
He ran after it and grabbed the <tag>steering</> wheel but the vehicle toppled over and James was thrown out.   

700051
A rear cigar lighter is fitted beside a 12v power take-off socket. 
All XMs have an electric tilt-slide sunroof, power <tag>steering</>, remote central locking, electric windows, tinted glass, an advanced ventilation system with recycle to cut out fumes in traffic, cut-pile or long-pile carpeting and a high quality stereo radio-cassette player with six speakers as standard.   

700052
The central locking system of the car was forced open and entry to the vehicle was gained. 
But although the <tag>steering</> control lock was smashed attempts to start the car were unsuccessful.   

700053
But they do not have enough side support to hold you firmly in place during hard cornering, and if you use the SXi in the way it is intended to be used, that becomes an irritating failing. 
Also annoying is the absurdly high-geared steering. 
It takes about four turns from one lock to another, which means much more twirling of the <tag>steering</> wheel than in most cars. 

700054
The wheel size has been increased to 8.25 17 in and the six-spoke Speedline wheels have 245/430 ZR 17 tyres. 
All-round electric windows, an electronically boosted roof aerial, leather-covered <tag>steering</> wheel and gear lever are standard.   

700055
As I made my way down Howard Street some children were playing on the pavement and rushing into the road. 
Keeping an eye on them, I did not correct the <tag>steering</> to negotiate a left turn around one of these structures.  

700057
The styling hasn't affected the practicality of the car. 
The doors are large and swing wide to allow the elderly or disabled easy access. 
Slip in behind the soft-feel wheel and get yourself comfy in the power-adjustable seat, adjust the <tag>steering</> wheel for rake and reach, alter the seat belt height and set the suspension system. 

700058
Not on the stalks, so they must be on the dashboard. 
To the right of the <tag>steering</> wheel was a strange knob which looked a likely candidate.   

700060
Features appreciated during a drive of almost 1,000 miles included the way the seat's built-in belt tailors itself to the occupant by moving up or down with the electrically adjusted head restraint. 
A memory stores three positions for the driver's seat, the rear-view mirrors and the <tag>steering</> wheel.   

700061
Ergonomically, the layout is hard to fault but the space allocated for the otherwise clear and attractive instrumentation seems to have shrunk &dash. it would have been far better to have the computer readout under the dials instead of the heater controls &dash. and we question the need for such extravagantly styled air vents. 
Most of our testers considered the driving position and seats close to perfect, but a couple of the taller specimens would have appreciated some sort of <tag>steering</> wheel adjustment to play off comfort against a clear view of the instruments.   

700063
Rover also upgraded the Metro last year, in three and five-door form. 
The new K-series are a huge improvement in response and refinement (especially the 1.1-litre) and at last there is a five-speed gearbox. 
The suspension has also been transformed and the driving position changed to eliminate niggles about off-set pedals and a steeply raked <tag>steering</> column. 

700065
Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board were sifting through the wreckage of the United Airlines jet yesterday in an attempt to piece together the reason for the accident, the first involving a DC-10 for several years. 
However, it was clear that the complete loss of control reported by the pilot was not caused by the loss of the tail-fin engine, but by the severing of all three of the plane's independent hydraulic systems. 
Like other jets, DC-10s can fly with engines out of action, but once vital hydraulic fluid started to bleed off the pilot could not operate landing gear, wing flaps, or <tag>steering</> systems, and the plane was effectively doomed. 

700066
Two out of three occupants decamped but the driver, Dommett, was trapped by his legs and had to be released by police who then arrested him on suspicion of theft. 
Dommett told police he had used a duplicate key and snapped the <tag>steering</> lock of the car before driving it to Hagbourne Road to pick up others and then to Oxford and back through Abingdon.   

700067
The Cadillac Automobile Company was formed in 902 out of the remnants of one of Henry Ford's early attempts at building cars, and the company's backers turned to Leland for help. 
Leland's firm made the engines, transmissions and <tag>steering</> gear and Cadillac went from building two cars in 1902 to producing 1895 in the year between March 1903 and March 1904.   

700068
How can these men (of course they are all men) drive their juggernauts at such insane speeds in such dreadful conditions? 
Frightened, Robyn clings to the <tag>steering</> wheel like a helmsman in a storm, her head craned forward to peer past the flailing windscreen wipers at the road ahead, ribbed with furrows of yellow-brown slush.   

700069
The Escort estate is guaranteed a following, and overall it will be deserved. 
In Ghia form it's a well trimmed and equipped car, but more than this there's a dynamic cohesion to it: somewhere along the line someone got the handling, ride and <tag>steering</> working in harmony rather than against each other.   

700070
The #17,315 V6 Cloverleaf has 192bhp, and a catalytic converter is standard-fit. 
Equipment includes a limited-slip differential, power <tag>steering</>, tinted glass, cental locking and alloy wheels.   

700071
Mr Morse told the inquest it happened too quickly for him to do anything about it. 
Witnesses said they saw Mr Cole appear to try and correct his <tag>steering</> before hitting the Toyota.   

700073
Sometimes he would come home from Fine Hall full of something to discuss, rushing into the kitchen where I was preparing supper. 
There was the famous incident I have mentioned of his getting burned when he stuck his head over the pot of soup I was stirring, in an effort to catch my gaze, just as he so often used to place his head over the <tag>steering</> wheel.   

700074
Drive it in smooth roads at regulated speeds and it makes an earnest, even laudable attempt at portraying an enthusiast's machine. 
All the right ingredients seem to be there: so it's easy enough to persuade yourself the sharp <tag>steering</>, smooth increase in turbo power in the mid-range, quick-shifting gear change and body-hugging seats imply something of a breakthrough by Detroit.  

700075
Producing 115bhp it can reach 117mph and accelerate from 0-62mph in 11.5 seconds. 
As you would expect from BMW, the specification is high, including central locking with `dead lock" to stop children opening doors, front electric windows, power <tag>steering</>, interior headlamp adjustment, heat-insulated green tinted glass and a roof mounted aerial for one of the best sound systems I have heard in a car.   

700076
The 205's chassis has achieved almost legendary status. 
On 165/70 SR13 Michelins, the 205XS has excellent grip nd handles in a very neutral fashion. 
The <tag>steering</> is unassisted, but that's no hardship. 

700078
Scarcity value apart, the Stag is made of the right stuff by classic yardsticks. 
It has style (Michelotti's), a luxurious, timber-encrusted cabin (with hard and soft headgear), six speeds to play with (four, plus two overdrive on the manual, though many Stags had three-speed automatic transmission) and a burbling V8 engine that can be found in no other car. 
In its day, fully independent suspension (like that of the Triumph 2000 saloon) and lavish equipment that included power-assisted <tag>steering</> were also assets.   

700079
Rolls has introduced a battery of minor changes to the cars too. 
Most obvious (to those who have had a Silver Spirit before) are a rearranged dashboard, extra outlets for the air-conditioning and more elaborate marquetry which, frankly, looks rather vulgar. 
Also new is a revised warning light module &dash. neater, but harder to read in bright sunlight; vanity mirrors in both sunvisors, each with a sliding walnut covers; seat heaters, which Volvos and Saabs have had for years; an altered parking brake, released when a gear is engaged &dash. clever; and a leather-bound <tag>steering</> wheel in place of the traditional Bakelite item.   

700080
It's a strong performer in the mid-ranges, sporty in feel, yet pleasantly hushed on the motorway. 
Both Rover and Honda use a new power <tag>steering</> set-up, called `positive centre-feel" (PCF). 

700081
Neat. 
Built into the single, wide spoke, <tag>steering</> wheel spoke are controls for altering volume and radio station.   

700084
Both have anti-lock brakes as standard. 
Also standard on both cars is power steering, perhaps a touch too heavy on the G60, a touch too light and rubbery on the Calibra. 
But both are acceptably direct, although the Corrado's <tag>steering</> has pinpoint accuracy. 

700085
The S was introduced at the end of January &dash. and was thus not part of our driving story last August &dash. but the ingredients are familiar enough. 
THe injected 108bhp 1.6-litre CVH engine, five-speed manual gearbox and three-door body are blended with uprated springs and dampers, 185/60 low-profile tyres and steel wheels with plastic trims and body changes that extend to a black rear spoiler and body colour bumper sections. 
Plus there is an excellent range of luxury equipment as standard: power windows and mirrors (also heated), central locking, sunroof, heated front screen, heated washer jets, RDS stereo and sports <tag>steering</> wheel. 

700086
Apparently the engine is so smooth that if one cylinder stops working due to an engine fault the only real way of identifying it, particularly during the cruise is by the lack of cylinder head temperature. 
The nose wheel <tag>steering</> provided good positive response and a very adequate turning circle, particularly bearing in mind the wing's length.   

700087
Mike went to great lengths to get the ergonomics right, tailor-made to Mary's size and strength. 
In fact, there are two cockpits, one for <tag>steering</> , from which primary winches, sheet car controls, mainsheet and ballast tank pump can all be reached without moving, and a deeper, off-watch cockpit designed for heavy weather.   

700088
The embracing front seats are as inviting and supportive as they look, but the driver's has naff adjusters. 
Get the seat right in one plane and it is likely to be wrong in another, even though cushion, <tag>steering</> wheel and belt anchor can be moved vertically. 

700089
The exaltation and delight which he had felt in the pub had faded into a purring contentment combined with a most luxurious heaviness of the whole body. 
He leaned upon the <tag>steering</> wheel, turning it with the length of his forearm, and singing inaudibly to himself.   

700090
It is like using a washing machine that does not clean. 
To keep your seat, even when cornering gently, means pressing back against the thick, grippy rim of the padded <tag>steering</> wheel. 

700091
Add options and you are left with a total of #13,190, which is the most ludicrously optimistic price I've heard for ages. 
Bear in mind that, even for that amount, you get standard Escort seats, which don't locate the driver properly in an LX let alone the S. Neither do you get an adjustable steering column. 
The extra goes on power <tag>steering</> (again, any Escort suffers badly without it), alloy wheels, anti-lock brakes, catalytic converter, body kit and a paint choice other than white or red.   

700093
Tributes were largely unknown to Ford's injected Cologne V6, but it is a worthy enough trooper. 
It never exactly whistles while it works &dash. if anything, it wheezes in its upper reaches &dash. but its torquey character and outright power endow the Sierra with a fleet turn of foot, particularly in the lower gears. 
I was unable to detect any knocking from the drive-shafts, protests from the power <tag>steering</> or `pulling" from the brakes.   

700095
Since its launch, the first boat, appropriately named British Steel Challenge, has sailed 400 miles a week, most of them within 15 miles of Plymouth. 
So far, groups pf crew have had an induction course and what is called `a long sail", when they spend several days acquainting themselves with the boat and gear, absorbing everything from how the cooker is switched on and how to flush the head to hoisting the mainsail and <tag>steering</>.   

700096
Yet, if nothing else, it is an enthusiastic cornerer. 
Once you're used to the lack of feel coming through the rim of the <tag>steering</> wheel, you can chuck the G40 into a corner, stabilise the understeer with a balanced throttle and belt round, gradually turning the power back on as the exit opens up.  

700098
Official consumption figures indicate competitive economy, though at, say, 25mpg, the range between fill-ups is not especially long. 
Only under hard acceleration in the intermediates does the assisted <tag>steering</>, normally crisp and accurate, fade towards vagueness, even to edginess.   

700099
The car is comfortable, with the crisp interior which has become a hallmark of recent GM cars. 
The car also claims the lowest drag coefficient (0.26) of any 4-seater in the world, which may or may not be true, but which means that Calibra is economical to run and quiet to drive. 
It comes with anti-lock brakes, power <tag>steering</>, height adjusting front seats, and a sophisticated alarm system as well as a host of other goodies, as standard.  

700100
Three versions of the Citroen XM Turbo Diesel will be launched in the UK &dash. the XM Turbo D at #16,900, the XM Turbo SD at #18,450 and the XM Turbo SED at #21,119. 
All have standard specification which includes remote control central locking, electric sunroof, height and reach adjustable <tag>steering</> wheel, electric fron windows and height adjustable drivers seat. 

700102
A steeply-raked windscreen, wedge profile with smooth wrap-round sides and semi-flush side glass completely covering the B-pillars gives the Calibra its distinctive appearance, which is enhanced by the frameless doorglass and aditional lower sill mouldings on the 16v version. 
Comprehensive standard specification on all models includes power-assisted steering, central door locking with security deadlocks, electric front windows with `one touch" operation, and an electric tilt-and-slide steel sunroof. 
Other standard features include fully reclining sports front seats with height adjustment, tilting <tag>steering</> wheel, security coded six-speaker stereo, electric headlamp levelling, electrically adjustable and heated door mirrors, tinted glass and low profile tyres. 

700103
As ever: this 911 feels small and responsive, at your beck and call. 
Small inputs are rewarded with a change in behaviour, not with mechanical slop. 
Power <tag>steering</> is now standard, but it does nothing to blunt the feedback coming from front wheels to steering wheel: the old wrist-snapping kickback over bumps is largely eradicated but the important messages are translated as crisply as ever.   

700105
Stepping from, say, a nippy 1,600 saloon, the 92mph diesel would feel slow and ponderous, not to say rough and gruff (the 102mph petrol V8 is much smoother and quieter). 
The engine's diesely clatter subsides as you accelerate, however, and noise is quite low at 70mph &dash. an easy canter in top, geared for over 25mph per 1,000rpm in both petrol and diesel models. 
Sharp corners call for much twirling of the assisted <tag>steering</> wheel, gear-changing for a firm hand, though the lever of the revised gearbox has a crisp, precise movement that would not disgrace a sports car.   

700106
Indeed, first impression tells you that the new car's chassis feels a little less sharp and agile than its predecessor's. 
Subtle, wrist-generated <tag>steering</> inputs don't do as much. 

700109
There were 25 gallons of fuel in each tank and our take-off weight was about 3,440 lbs which left another 360 lbs for more fuel with another passenger and some baggage. 
Visibility from the left-hand seat is above average for an American aircraft; you can see all around, except for about 30&degree. in the rear, and visibility upwards is acceptable but slightly degraded by the roof which wraps around to the sides of the cabin. 
Nosewheel <tag>steering</> is light and the brakes are satisfactory if not particularly powerful.  

700110
The firm, choppy ride would be easier to accept if the handling were sharper, crisper, more poised. 
Steering is stodgy and low geared &dash. an awful combination that denies the XR2i pin-sharp agility. 
If quick <tag>steering</> response could not be achieved with unassisted steering, Ford should have conceded defeat and brought in hydraulic help. 

700112
Internally, the cab has rake adjustable cloth seats and head restraints, fully trimmed doors and a well-designed dashboard with a push-button radio. 
Precise <tag>steering</> and a five-speed gearbox add to the car-like driving characteristics and under the bonnet the Taro has a robust engine giving 32mpg at 55mph on unleaded petrol and a top speed of 87mph.   

700113
Three versions of the Citroen XM Turbo Diesel will be launched in the UK &dash. the XM Turbo D at #16,900, the XM Turbo SD at #18,450 and the XM Turbo SED at #21,119. 
All have standard specification which includes remote control central locking, electric sunroof, height and reach adjustable steering wheel, electric fron windows and height adjustable drivers seat. 
The SD and SED also have electrically adjustable front seats, automatic temperature control with independent rear face level outlets and <tag>steering</> wheel mounted radio controls.   

700114
Both Rover and Honda use a new power steering set-up, called `positive centre-feel" (PCF). 
The advantage of this system is that it eliminates the slightly vague feeling around the straight ahead position, which curses many other power steering set-ups. 
It provides accurate, well-weighted <tag>steering</> at all speeds.

On 165/70 SR13 Michelins, the 205XS has excellent grip nd handles in a very neutral fashion. 
The steering is unassisted, but that's no hardship. 
As with all 205s, the balance and <tag>steering</> response of the XS don't come at the expense of an uncompromising ride.  

700116
With 235bhp and 285lb ft of torque, it delivers a top speed of 139mph and 60mph acceleration of 8.3secs. 
The electronically-controlled four-speed automatic ZF gearbox makes the most of the engines's vitality, especially in `sport" mode. 
Slightly less willing to react is a chassis afflicted by over-light  <tag>steering</> that lacks feel.   

700117
The first thing you notice when you get in is the low supportive seating position with legs outstretched. 
Driving is pure pleasure, thanks to Mazda's combination of power assisted <tag>steering</> and tilt-adjustable steering wheel which allows just about any driver to tuck in comfortably.   

700118
He said the most radical changes on the new car, the front and rear spoilers, provide considerable downward pressure. 
Like the other advanced aerodynamic features of the car they have been designed following wind tunnel experiments. 
The front spoiler can be set in two positions &dash. one extends it forward for precision <tag>steering</> at high speeds, the other allows easier manoeuvring around town where the spoiler is raised to avoid kerb damage.   

700120
It offers a firm, well-controlled ride that's a little noisy at low speed and thumps a bit over potholes, but it's far from bone-shaking. 
But this good control, plus the fine grip and limited body roll, are badly let down in the driver appeal stakes by the steering. 
The optional power system should be considered essential, if only to avoid the seriously slow (4.6 turns lock to lock, and vague with it) manual <tag>steering</> that's listed as standard. 

700121
Head teacher Mark Hughes said they hoped to have the playroom installed in one of the classrooms sometime during the summer term. 
Chipping Norton bus driver, Mr John Hannis, remembers the day when he and his conductor were stuck in snow drifts and had to walk 11 miles back to the bus station. 
After nearly 40 years, Mr Hannis, 65, of Walterbush Road, Chipping Norton, has stepped down from behind the <tag>steering</> wheel. 

700124
The cockpit is deep, and comfortable and there are useful winch handle pockets in each coaming. 
Whitlock draglink <tag>steering</> is fitted as standard, driven by a 42in (1067mm) diameter, hide-covered wheel. 

700125
Unfortunately this coincides exactly with its ideal cruising speed. 
On slightly narrower 165/65 section tyres it seems to grip almost as well as the G40, while its <tag>steering</> seems, if anything, a tad sharper.  

700126
So while the Paseo feel safe and secure through corners, you long for the poise and quick reflexes of a CRX. 
Better news is that torque steer is almost non-existent and the level of grip from the (optional) 185/60 R14 82H Bridgstone Potenzas is high. 
Understeer and roll are well contained, but for the enthusiast driver the Paseo's dull turn-in and bland <tag>steering</> are disappointing. 

700127
The US Environmental Protection Agency yesterday said it would ban nearly all asbestos products in the US over the next seven years. 
AT least 14 passengers on an Israeli bus were killed and 27 injured yesterday when a Palestinian from the occupied territories grabbed the <tag>steering</> wheel and forced the vehicle over the edge of a steep ravine on the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway.   

700128
But they do not have enough side support to hold you firmly in place during hard cornering, and if you use the SXi in the way it is intended to be used, that becomes an irritating failing. 
Also annoying is the absurdly high-geared <tag>steering</>. 

700129
Cockpit design was critical. 
Only 5ft 4in (1.6m) tall, Mary needed to be able to reach all the important controls from the <tag>steering</> cockpit.   

700130
`Somewhat equivalent to equipping one's regular crew with lead-soled wellies," said Mike in his design notes. 
Retractable trimboards (see picture) can be deployed to ease <tag>steering</> in heavy weather reaching conditions, but so far they have not been needed.   

700135
Both models have a top speed 101 mph, and fuel consumption of 56.5 mpg at 56 mph. 
At #11,449 the BX 19TGD automatic's standard equipment includes power <tag>steering</>, central locking, electric sunroof, electric front windows and tinted glass.   

700136
But this sophisticated attempt to deal with exhibitor resistance to British films was ruled illegal by the US Justice Department in 1946 and had to be replaced by a less ambitious system, in which Rank's films were sold on their merits. 
While continuing negotiation with the Americans, Rank also bought cinema circuits in Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Egypt and South Africa. 
Many set the odds on Rank achieving his ambitions very low indeed, seemingly believing that, as Eric Ambler was later to remark, `a policy of selling British cars to America with their <tag>steering</> wheels on the right would have had the same chance of success."   

700137
When he left Williams for Ferrari, I remember Frank Williams reminiscing at his annual press luncheon that he had fond memories of Alan Jones and Keke Rosberg, but that it would be some time before he had similar memories of Nigel. 
If you fancy owning the nose cone of Alain Prost's Ferrari, a piston and con-rod from the engine of Jean Alesi's Tyrrell or a <tag>steering</> wheel from Ayrton Senna's Marlboro-McLaren, you should really be at Jackie Stewart's special charity auction of motor sport memorabilia, which is raising funds for the Scottish Dyslexia Trust Fund. 

700138
Past Sha'ar Hagai (Bab al-Wad to the Arabs) the three-line highway rises steeply into the Judean hills and then flattens out for a straight, final stretch, with a deep ravine falling away on the southern side. 
Just before noon yesterday an Arab passenger on the number 405 shouted `Allahu Akbar" &dash. God is Greatest &dash. jumped on the driver, wrenched the <tag>steering</> wheel sharply to the right and forced the bus down over the steep hillside.   

700140
Two men brought in huge ladles suspended from hoists which they guided with pushbutton controls on the end of electric cables, held in one hand. 
The other hand grasped a kind of huge <tag>steering</> wheel attached to the side of the ladle, which they turned to tip the molten metal into the small holes in the mould-boxes. 

700141
It has started first time without exception so far, and pulls smoothly when cold. 
The <tag>steering</> is light &dash. although at almost four turns lock-to-lock, wheel-twirling can be a chore in town.

Add options and you are left with a total of #13,190, which is the most ludicrously optimistic price I've heard for ages. 
Bear in mind that, even for that amount, you get standard Escort seats, which don't locate the driver properly in an LX let alone the S. Neither do you get an adjustable <tag>steering</> column. 

700146
You can find other good things too, even if it is only a matter of degrees. 
Body roll is well contained, grip is strong (though not up to S levels) and there is a progressive feeling to the handling that the S lacks. 
With these comfort-orientated suspension settings, the <tag>steering</> does a serviceable job, without the slight nervousness of the stiffer S. 

700148
Driving the car is a pleasure. 
<tag>Steering</>, which is power-assisted is light and progressive, making it perfect for round-town work and for parking, while retaining feel for stable cruising at motorway speeds. 

700149
Chassis details follow the broad principles laid down by the Turbo R, with three-stage electronically controlled dampers serving what is basically a MacPherson strut front and semi-trailing arm rear suspension geometry. 
The <tag>steering</> and braking systems are power-assisted rack and pinion and all-round ventilated discs as before and overall dimensions, dictated by the saloon's 120.5ins wheelbase, are again comparable at 210ins long and 80.5ins wide.   

700150
It offers a firm, well-controlled ride that's a little noisy at low speed and thumps a bit over potholes, but it's far from bone-shaking. 
But this good control, plus the fine grip and limited body roll, are badly let down in the driver appeal stakes by the <tag>steering</>. 

700151
It isn't serious enough to spoil your enjoyment of the car but is hard to understand from a company that spent millions developing the Lexus, the car that banished noise, vibration and harshness. 
As you drive, this NVH manifests itself in the form of tiny vibrations fed back through the <tag>steering</> wheel and the gruff, uninspiring sounds from the SE-FHE engine.   

700152
Red Alligator passed the black buoy with a threequarter-length lead and shortly after mounted a determined push at 37 which had a startling effect. 
The Banshee shuddered to a halt, its fin and rudder ripped out by a gate floating just below the surface. 
Without <tag>steering</> and with a three-foot gash along the stern The Banshee, with president Paddy Mant and four Goldie oars on board, withdrew leaving Red Alligator to race the 100-1 outsider Foinavon in the re-row. 

700154
Surely not too much to ask of a model that, by its makers' own assertion, is aimed at `performance and handling enthusiasts". 
Until we came to the Furka I'd been impressed by the Spirit R/T, surprised by the agility of its handling, the sensitivity and accuracy of its power-assisted rack-and-pinion <tag>steering</>, the breadth of the uninterrupted acceleration from its powerful turbocharged engine, the lightness of the controls and the quality of the gearchange. 

700158
Both have anti-lock brakes as standard. 
Also standard on both cars is power <tag>steering</>, perhaps a touch too heavy on the G60, a touch too light and rubbery on the Calibra. 

700159
The pedals, too, seem to have been located by someone who has yet to discover the science of ergonomics. 
While the <tag>steering</> wheel is offset to the left, the pedals are positioned to the right. 

700160
The bonnet is low and the width of the pillars have been reduced and moved towards the back. 
Standard features include electric windows and mirrors, power <tag>steering</>, central locking and a smoked glass sunroof.   

700161
I would be in favour of making it illegal to smoke while driving. 
It is amazing how often one sees a smoker tugging at his or her <tag>steering</> wheel with one hand while the other seeks to introduce the lighted item to those waiting lips.   

700165
There are other anomalies with supposedly superior models, too. 
The GLX I drove, again fully loaded with options including anti-lock brakes, had a firm brake pedal and Ford's cleverly adjusting steering column &dash. two items the S could certainly do with. 
But not the manual <tag>steering</>, which again has such an effect on the driving character of the car that it is impossible to overlook. 

700168
Anyone who thinks owning a diesel spells the end of driving fun, should park their backside in the AX's comfortable, supportive driver's seat and go for a quick ride. 
It carries a bit more weight in its nose (diesel engines are heavier than petrol) but the derv-sipping AX is just as agile as its petroleum cousins. 
Light, accurate <tag>steering</> allows you to place the car precisely in a bend, and although there is a fair amount of body roll, once you've chosen your cornering line not even bumps half-way through will deflect the faithful AX from its path.   

700169
Only wind noise above 80mph from the A-pillars and exterior mirrors intrudes on the solitude of motorway driving. 
Our Vauxhall suffered from an annoying fifth gear whine on a trailing throttle but the engine's hard-edged  yet effortless snarl as it wound out to the 6600rpm cut-out is a far more satisfying sound than the Chrysler four. 
If the power-assisted rack-and-pinion <tag>steering</> seems excessively light at low speeds its directness, with a mere 2.5-turns lock to lock, makes you wonder whatever happened to the so-called `sneeze factor" (ie forgiving low gearing) that was once considered essential in American cars. 

700170
He wondered with an almost insane indifference when he would be allowed to switch on the windscreen wipers. 
Daniel calmly watched nine white sails drift off into a diminishing patch of purple. 
He could no longer be sure that his hands were still clamped to the <tag>steering</> wheel.   

700171
New Mazda RX7 prices start at #22,000 for the coupe and #24,000 for the cabriolet. 
The price includes anti-lock brakes, cruise control, speed-related variable assistance <tag>steering</> and, on the coupe, an electric sunroof. 

700172
Do the engines still lack refinement? 
Are the seats still meagre, the gearchange notchy, the brake pedal spongy and the <tag>steering</> slow and vague?   

700173
At 56 mph it returns 44.8 mpg (automatic: 38.2 mpg), 75 mph 34 mpg (38.2) and on the urban cycle 25.7 mpg (25.9). 
Standard equipment on the 190E 1.8 includes twin heated exterior mirrors, electrically operated on the passenger side. 
There's also power-assisted <tag>steering</>, multi-point central locking, tinted glass and a height-adjustable driver's seat.   

700175
The new model gets sports suspension, 185/60x14 tyres and XR3i engine. 
Equipment includes power front windows, heated windscreen and washers, electric mirrors, sunroof, velour interior and sports <tag>steering</> wheel.   

700176
Restatement of Torts, Second itself bears testimony that the stock situation contemplated by the Rule was a fault in the production process, where only the plaintiff's lack of access to the evidence prevented him from identifying exactly what had gone wrong. 
Nobody would dispute that new cars should not be equipped with faulty brakes or <tag>steering</>, that Coca Cola bottles should not contain wayward mice or explode in your face, or that lawn-mowers should not fling their blades into the user's legs.   

700177
But as with any machinery, regular (though mainly quite simple) maintenance must not be neglected. 
In the main, avoid small cabin cruisers steered by a combination of wheel and outboard. 
A strong wind, or a little slack in the <tag>steering</> cables, can render them almost unmanageable.   

700178
The Prairie is unusually nimble for a car of this type, and it rides very well. 
You will not be sweating at the wheel either, because power-assisted <tag>steering</> is standard. 

700179
The County is #16,058, the same price for the petrol and diesel turbo versions. 
I was grateful for the power <tag>steering</> which enabled me to manoeuvre the Land Rover with the greatest of ease, and soon the beast became almost second nature.   

700180
Indeed, the quality feel of the car, the ease and enjoyment of driving it, and the handling and ride rewards that its Hydragas suspension offers make it all too simple to overlook the problems. 
The 1.1-litre K series engine seems to improve with every mile, providing smooth and enthusiastic performance at low revs or high speeds, and proving an ideal partner for the five-speed gearbox, which is a sheer delight to use. 
Add this to <tag>steering</> that is not too heavy when parking and direct and communicative at speed, and a chassis that irons out most road imperfections but still allows great cornering balance, and the Metro is rarely unsuited to a journey, whether motorway or A-road, long or short.   

700181
Any minus points? 
`Well, I do have power <tag>steering</> and an excellent radio, but I miss having electric windows.   

700184
But then you don't build character overnight. 
All right, it's looking a little dated now; the <tag>steering</> wheel is absurdly large, even by Mercedes' standards, and someone else makes a smoother, quieter V8.   

700185
Yet threading the Turbo R through traffic is never a problem. 
Other cars keep out of your way and the <tag>steering</>, though very light, is sensibly geared and very accurate.   

700186
Servo-assisted braking is by discs at the front and drums at the rear with a split circuit, load sensitive, pressure limiting valve. 
Suspension is fully independent front and rear, with MacPherson struts and anti-roll bar at the front, and trailing arms and torsion bars at the rear. 
Power assisted <tag>steering</> is standard equipment on the Peugeot 309 GRDT, enabling the driver to make light work of parking while providing sufficient feedback on the open road.   

700187
The #7,895 BX St Tropez has white wheel trims and bumpers, green tinted glass and a removable sunroof. 
Based on the BX 14TE, with its 1360 cc engine and five speed gearbox, the BX St Tropez has 104 mph performance and includes patterned cloth upholstery, rear wash/wipe and front seat head restraints. 
The #5,995 AX Jazz based on the AX 10E, has a sporty interior with GT style seats, <tag>steering</> wheel and interior fittings, removable sunroof, special graphics and side stripes, stereo radio/cassette and rear wash/wipe.   

700189
They are at present working on Pete From Manchester Mark VII. 
Round-the-world sailing: Computers have often sailed round the world in the form of automatic <tag>steering</> gear, robot helm control, etc.   

700190
That's a shame, for it is obvious, just from how eagerly it will push its tail out if you cut the power, that the chassis has a rare agility. 
Unfortunately, as we found with the 500SL, the <tag>steering</> fails to meet the standards set by the rest of the chassis. 

700191
The chassis has mixed abilities, too. 
Wearing 175/60 Continental tyres, it has nothing like the grip of a 205 GTi, nor does it have the Peugeot's <tag>steering</> feel.   

700193
Not all options are available as accessories, of course. 
Power <tag>steering</>, for example, generally has to be factory-fitted, although one or two manufacturers &dash. Peugeot, for example, for the 1.9 205 &dash. make after-market power steering kits available, at a price.   

700195
ARI VATANEN (Finland) Mitsubishi Galant VR4 (car No. 2) A spectacular driving style earned him the world championship in 1981 and victory in the RAC Rally in 1984. 
Well on the road to recovery from a terrible accident in 1985. 
The four-wheel <tag>steering</> Mitsubishi is now reliable enough to challenge Kankkunen and the Toyotas. 

700196
The Prairie is unusually nimble for a car of this type, and it rides very well. 
You will not be sweating at the wheel either, because power-assisted steering is standard. 
Though the <tag>steering</> feels a little detached at high speeds you do not get much road feel the pay-off at parking speeds is well worth it. 

700197
But more important than the top speed is the fact that there is plenty of power in the lower rev range, which is good for a heavily loaded car or for towing. 
Standard equipment includes power <tag>steering</>, central locking with a deadlock, a roller blind 

700199
I was fortunate in that when I first sat inside the car, I had the invaluable assistance of a colleague newly initiated in the mysterious art of getting on the move in an XM. 
Instead of a handbrake, the XM has a dashboard-mounted handle on the right of the <tag>steering</> wheel which you operate in combination with a floor-mounted pedal on the left hand side of the clutch pedal.  

700200
The six year anti-corrosion warranty and one year's free roadside breakdown and recovery club membership remain. 
The Riva 1300 Select has a five-speed gearbox, reclining front seats, fully carpeted interior, laminated windscreen and servo dual-circuit brakes as standard, while its sister Samara model has modern front-wheel-drive technology, five-speed transmission, rack and pinion <tag>steering</>, cloth upholstery, carpeting, rear wash/wipe and load adjustable headlamps.   

700201
In pure driving terms, the winner has to be the Corrado. 
Its chassis offers terrific handling balance, great traction matched to positive brakes and accurate <tag>steering</>.   

700204
Our Vauxhall suffered from an annoying fifth gear whine on a trailing throttle but the engine's hard-edged  yet effortless snarl as it wound out to the 6600rpm cut-out is a far more satisfying sound than the Chrysler four. 
If the power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering seems excessively light at low speeds its directness, with a mere 2.5-turns lock to lock, makes you wonder whatever happened to the so-called `sneeze factor" (ie forgiving low gearing) that was once considered essential in American cars. 
The Spirit's <tag>steering</> is sharp and super-sensitive, requiring no more than finger-tip control, in stark contrast to the Vauxhall that always feels meaty and firm, yet with a touch of on-centre slack.   

700206
`Go on." 
`What remained of the car was examined but, as far as could be told, there was nothing wrong with the brakes or the <tag>steering</> and the tyres were nearly new." 

700207
The 323F is one of three distinct models in the 323 range which is fighting it out in the competitive family car market. 
All three, including the five-door fastback, three-door hatchback and four-door saloon, have 16-valve engines which run on unleaded fuel without adjustment, power <tag>steering</>, central locking and ventilated front disc brakes and all benefit from a new paint process which gives a high-gloss finish.   

700208
There is also a slippage control which automatically cuts power if the wheels begin to spin under harsh acceleration. 
All this is linked to four-wheel <tag>steering</> and ESC adaptive suspension, which adjusts its settings to limit body roll and optimise tyre grip during cornering.   

700209
TAKE YOUR TABLETS. 
He fought for a while with the <tag>steering</> wheel, hoping it was a real steering wheel, waiting for the admonition to burn away.   

700211
Goodyear test drivers are out in all weather and all conditions &dash. their job requires it. 
And they have put together a few tips which they put into practice when the grip of winter has lessened their grip on the road: Use a lighter than usual touch on brake, accelerator and <tag>steering</> wheel Accelerate gradually, fierce acceleration will send the driving wheels spinning and the car out of control Think well ahead in order to cope with emergencies before they arise When stopping on ice, pump the brakes gently to prevent skidding and in order to maintain steering control Steer carefully into a corner, sudden changes of direction in slippery conditions can easily result in skids Without labouring the engine, use as high a gear as possible to avoid wheel-spin on ice or snow If you do start to skid &dash. don't panic, steer in the direction of the skid until the car straightens; be particularly careful in your use of the brakes; get back on course and, if possible, keep driving.   

700214
In the Tipo 1.4, the engine is sweet and refined, as well as quite peppy; in the Sana, it excites unpleasant body booms when idling, and becomes rough and raucous when extended. 
Gear ratios are well chosen but the vague and sticky gearchange is poor, the clutch quite heavy. 
So is the imprecise <tag>steering</>, especially when parking.   

700217
In short, it could be a different engine &dash. until you go in search of the red line, when things still get frenetic. 
Even against the estate, the ride / handling / <tag>steering</> / braking package is by far the most convincing, as you would expect given SVE's involvement.   

700218
This means a neat, well laid-out dashboard and instrument binnacle display, with central and side face vents, digital clock, and vertical console containing the heater-blower controls, self-seeking stereo/radio with anti-theft coding, ashtray and cigar lighter (why never cigarettes?), and press switches for hazards, front and rear fogs, electric front windows and remote tailgate release. 
Also pleasing is that the stalk-operated front and rear wash-wipe system, and the indicator stub, are sufficiently close behind the tiny twin-spoked leather-trimmed sports <tag>steering</> wheel to be operated almost without lifting the hands off.   

700219
`I drive a Renault Boston," she said. 
`The things I look for in a car are power <tag>steering</>, central locking, heating that works and a stereo.   

700220
`The foundry, and the machine shop. 
We also do a bit of assembly work &dash. small engines and <tag>steering</> assemblies, I'm trying to build it up &dash. but basically we're a general engineering firm, supplying components to the motor industry mostly.   

700221
It's not an easy one to get right either, with the greatly different torsional character of a convertible. 
Certainly here is the only Escort variant with a degree of throttle <tag>steering</> available; a responsive chassis.  

700222
They are currently pressing for a standard to be set throughout the EC. 
And these days it is much more difficult to do wondrous things with coat-hangers, thanks to modern design. 
<tag>Steering</> column locks are more sophisticated, and an increasing number of car radios now have a `self-destruct" system.   

700223
It's not. 
Standard equipment includes engine speed-sensing power assisted <tag>steering</>, electric windows, tinted glass, detachable Clarion stereo-radio cassette, lockable central storage box, cigar lighter, panel light control and fuel-lid opener.   

700225
The specification does not leave much to be desired, but there are options should your budget stretch to more than the standard car's #10,418. 
The list includes #300 for finger-light power <tag>steering</>, #650 for leather upholstery to complement the burr walnut, and #895 for a Bosch electronic, anti-lock braking system.   

700226
Undoubtedly a major factor here is the 5ins longer wheelbase and wider front and rear tracks. 
For a load carrier, the ride is level and smooth when unladen. 
Changing direction won't exactly bring out the Mansell in you but the power <tag>steering</> &dash. in theory the same as that fitted to the others &dash. reacts swiftly and smoothly, and understeer is significantly less than that of the 1.4 GLX.   

700227
The firm, choppy ride would be easier to accept if the handling were sharper, crisper, more poised. 
<tag>Steering</> is stodgy and low geared &dash. an awful combination that denies the XR2i pin-sharp agility. 

700228
Throw in superb antilock brakes and permanent four-wheel drive in case the going gets a bit tough. 
Let's spoil ourselves with a superb sound system. 
While we are at it let's throw in electric windows, power <tag>steering</>, tilt adjustable steering, a sophisticated pushbutton ventilation and heating system bags of leg and headroom and a huge loadspace.  

700229
Every step of the way she imagined the deprecating eyes of everyone in the village following her. 
Rain drove the length of the long steep hill and pulled the car into the first convenient gateway. 
Then she banged her fist down on the <tag>steering</> wheel, gave a shout of glee and let her joy be unconfined.   

700230
At Stream Cottage, in a village over that way." 
She lifted a hand from the <tag>steering</> wheel, waggled it towards the south.  

700231
What now? 
Fortunately the book has plenty of advice, suggesting that the novice is first driven by an experienced driver, while `resting his hand lightly on the <tag>steering</> wheel". 

700232
But where was all the switchgear? 
The column stalks are fine: indicators, lights and horn on the left, wipers on the right. 
But the hazard warnings, rear fog lights and rear screen demister are an arm's length away, obscured by the <tag>steering</> wheel, while the switch for the front fogs is hidden above my right knee.   

700233
He sensed that the capitals, which came in intermittent stings totally unlike the jabs of pain afflicting all other parts of the body, would eventually retreat back into the lower-case typography within which, indisputably, he existed. 
An awkward, evasive bend was once again being negotiated in this treescaped passage, foot barely touching the tiny accelerator pedal, hands still determinedly clinging to the slithering <tag>steering</> wheel.   

700237
The 4x4 Estate is one of the latest additions to Citroen's already successful BX range which achieved record UK sales last year. 
Based closely on the BX 19TZS Estate it has a high specification &dash. power <tag>steering</>, remote control central locking, all-electric windows, green-tinted glass and a six-speaker Blaupunkt stereoradio system.   

700238
Eventually I found the lights on the left hand side of the dashboard, that was a relief, but where was the choke? 
That is placed under the <tag>steering</> wheel and the Lada people have a helpful arrow to show you where it is as you can't actually see it!   

700240
It's a neat, modern design, if unadventurous. 
Japanese cars traditionally have counted high equipment levels among their attributes. 
All Concertos have an electric sunroof and power <tag>steering</>, and two models, from a range of three, also feature anti-lock braking as standard.   

700243
Martin Luther King won the Nobel Peace Prize and Nelson Mandela was jailed for life; Winston Churchill was 90 but the only fighting on the beaches was between the Mods and Rockers. 
It was also the year in which the train robbers were sentenced and France and England agreed to the principle of a Channel Tunnel. 
A 1964 pound would be worth #8.96 today, so the #1228.46 for our Austin-Healey (including overdrive, wire wheels, heater, telescopic <tag>steering</> column and seat belts) equates to #11,006. 

700244
The Astra CD hatchback and the Astra Belmont CD saloon have adjustable lumbar support fitted to the front seats.
