By contrast, the American preference for pluralism and the free market has led to a proliferation of compensation structures whose aggregate of benefits and expenditures can hold its own in comparison with the welfare efforts elsewhere. 
The federal social security system, it is true, makes only a modest contribution to accident compensation, free hospital care being provided only for the elderly (Medicare) and the poor (Medicaid), and <tag>disability</> benefits only for persons (under 65) who suffer total and lasting disablement.

However, such an adjustment in monetary policy will not solve the structural weaknesses of the British economy to which Andrew Gamble has referred.

The best of the later piano pieces somehow capture in their fugitive interweaving of melodic scraps and mechanical patterns a Haiku-like resonance far beyond their means. 
And the very greyness of orchestration of a score such as the ballet Parade, which the storybook line-up of Cocteau, Picasso, Massine and Satie created for Diaghilev in 1918, subverts the circus-like gaiety of its musical surface in a disturbing ambiguity.

None the less, over 85 per cent of the population are covered by private medical insurance, though not all of these for long-term chronic illness.

There is also a lack of co-ordination of the services involved in community care which Roy Griffiths attempted to address in his less-than-recent report and to which the Government's published response is still awaited with bated breath. 
Further, the unrealistic expectation of problems not existing for people once they are discharged to the community has been accompanied by another unrealistic expectation that simply relocating a service from the hospital to the community would automatically invest it with non-institutional attributes. 
Whilst new `model" units have produced findings reinforcing this expectation, a recently published study by myself and colleagues in Northampton and Oxford (Psychological Medicine 1989, 19, 459-467) comparing two established units for people with a psychiatric <tag>disability</>, one in the community and one in a hospital, demonstrated that institutional practices could occur in the community, in some cases to a greater extent than in hospital settings.

Mr Newton has told his advisory committee that one of the reasons for the change is `other priorities among the sick and disabled". 
The saving of #70m to #80m a year `should be seen in the context of significant increases in other areas of provision for the sick and disabled"; namely the #100m boost in benefits for the disabled from April. 
The trade-off between sick pay and <tag>disability</> benefits coincides with delays in the review of disability payments and with a warning from Mr Newton, in an interview with Community Care, that `a revolution" in the structure of the benefits is not `a practical proposition".

Yesterday he sent his eight national coaches and the sport's three development officers to Crystal Palace to learn the same lessons at an `awareness day" organised as part of the Post Office Counters' Coaching for the Disabled programme by the British Sports Association for the Disabled. 
Coaches accustomed to getting the best out of able-bodied athletes went back to school to find out for themselves how life is for an athlete with a <tag>disability</>, and how he or she should be coached.

This is believed to be the first such post funded by a charity. 
<tag>Disability</> Now, the society journal, reports that it will be paying #12,000 in the first year, two-thirds of the part-time salary, and #3,000 to #4,000 of the administrative costs.

`When those concerned turn their attention to this problem, they may find they have to make a distinction between litigation in which there is a direct public interest in the result and that in which the public interest is limited to ensuring that an adequate system of justice is available. 
`In the first category we have criminal cases, judicial review and cases which involve matrimonial status and the welfare of children or those under a <tag>disability</>.

But he said that at the council's budget making time, Labour councillors never questioned the expenditure on sport and recreation. 
Recreation committee chairman Mr John Colegrave said Cherwell's policy was simply to provide sports facilities for all residents, no matter what their background or abilities or <tag>disabilities</>, and that sport was subsidised by the council.   

700091
Morrissey, noted for his over-sensitive nature, wasn't taking the Christmas necessities very seriously. 
His forecast for 1985 in the NME led to nothing more than a throwaway: `<tag>Disability</> chic will reign rampantly in 1985. 

700093
There have always been great artists with disabilities, from Beethoven to Stevie Wonder, but their work has been produced `despite" the supposed limitation. 
They haven't aimed their work at disabled people, nor sought to collaborate with others to produce work arising from their common experience. 
And they certainly never dreamt of actually celebrating their <tag>disabilities</>.

Singing the booking form shows that you believe yourself and your companions to be physically fit and healthy to take part. 
Fal Sail should be informed of any medical treatment being received, any <tag>disability</>, or whether you are affected by epilepsy, angina, asthma, diabetes, giddy spells or any heart condition.

Women, though at one time excluded from most public functions, were never by reason merely of their sex in a substantially different position from men as regards criminal liability, property and contract, if we except the rule (now nearly obsolete) which prefers males to females in the succession to real estate on intestacy. 
A married woman, on the other hand, had at Common Law a very peculiar status involving both <tag>disabilities</> and privileges.   

700097
It has rightly been pointed out that the code of practice of national newspapers entirely overlooks irrelevant references to gender, gender-roles and sexual orientation (letters, 1 December). 
The other group in society frequently referred to in the Press by derogatory and inaccurate stereotypes is people with disabilities. 
Misapprehensions about deafness &dash. one of the least understood <tag>disabilities</> &dash. have resulted in deep prejudices. 

700098
In giving the arguments in favour of pre-embryo research in your leading article (24 November) you omitted a critical reason for its continuation, namely the avoidance of multiple birth. 
Some childless couples are delighted to have twins but those who become pregnant with triplets or more face, at best, enormous physical, financial and emotional stress and, at worst, the death or <tag>disability</> of one, more or all of their children.

All children, whatever their abilities or <tag>disabilities</>, have a statutory right to be educated; and all parents have a corresponding duty to see that they are educated, at least up to the age of 16.   

700100
The Prime Minister has several times repeated her support for a reduction to 24 weeks, but no further. 
A reduction in the limit from 28 to 24 weeks would have almost no effect on the number of abortions carried out, because doctors universally interpret the Infant Life Preservation Act 1929 as meaning that 24 weeks is in effect the limit unless there are overwhelming social and <tag>disability</> reasons for carrying out very late abortions.   

700101
The Republican is John McCain of Arizona. 
The senators have defended themselves by saying they were engaging in `constituent service" &dash. the `surgery" function of an MP &dash. involving such things as making sure constituents receive <tag>disability</> cheques, or helping a local manufacturer get a government contract.   

700102
None the less, over 85 per cent of the population are covered by private medical insurance, though not all of these for long-term chronic illness. 
In addition to workers' compensation, a number of states require non-occupational <tag>disability</> insurance,{fo id=102} many have enacted no-fault automobile insurance, and federal legislation has experimented with several compensation plans for special injuries, notably black lung disease{fo id=103} and now vaccine injuries,{fo id=104} as well as making itself responsible for excess insurance for nuclear accidents.

Who seeks to support and encourage midwives in their struggle for recognition as independent practitioners? 
Who has the most comprehensive information in the country on every aspect of childbirth, breastfeeding and postnatal care, all of which is available to the public free of charge? who has comprehensive information for parents with <tag>disabilities</>?   

700104
But can't they recognise that these are examples of indecent wages that should be considered illegal and unacceptable in a civilised society?" 
Pensioners, children, and people with <tag>disabilities</> were the groups with the first claim for an urgent improvement in benefits under Labour, Mr Smith said.

They wore strange clothing, never saluted, moved at random and spoke to their superiors before being spoken to. 
Despite his artificial hip there was no suggestion of <tag>disability</> in Chay's walk.

In longer-established artists, the new spirit is visible as a change of direction. 
Johnny Crescendo, the performer who has most clearly articulated disability issues in civil rights terms, has performed as blues singer and alternative poet for some 20 years, building a reputation around Northern folk clubs and the cabaret circuit. 
Yet he has only been performing overt <tag>disability</> material for five years, starting with the poem `Where'd you get that leg?", a satire on the crass questions that all disabled people experience.   

700109
It may affect a patient's power to recall the names of people or the names of even the most familiar objects, alternatively a stroke can affect speech by impairing the movement of lips and the tongue. 
Road accidents and diseases such as Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis may lead to similar communication <tag>disabilities</>. 

700110
The second (the interest of persons that others will be free to communicate with them) and third (the interest of people to live in a society in which communication is free &dash. even if they personally do not wish to communicate with others) are interests of people other than the right-holder in his right. 
In the Common Law freedom of expression is regularly defended, where it is defended, on grounds of the public interest, that is on the interests of third parties. 
The right-holder's interest itself, conceived independently of its contribution to the public interest, is deemed insufficient to justify holding others to be subject to the extensive duties and <tag>disabilities</> commonly derived from the right of free speech.   

700111
Two years later they married, with Jane still based at Gombe while he kept his home and work in Dar es Salaam. 
Bryceson had been a wartime pilot; shot down in the Middle East, he taught himself to walk again only through exceptional determination. 
The <tag>disability</> didn't prevent him from farming in Tanzania and going on to hold several posts in the Tanzanian Cabinet.

There is a third imperative to be considered. 
If research on early clusters of human cells leads to the alleviation of preventative pain and lifelong <tag>disability</>, should society ban such research?

In the last two weeks they have snatched more than #1,000 in cash and jewellery from vulnerable elderly women by posing as charity workers. 
The woman, who asked not to be named, said the couple posed as nurses to get into her home in Rose Hill, Oxford. 
While one kept her talking about her <tag>disability</>, the other asked to use the lavatory.   

700114
It is whether children with special needs should attend a special school, 
and of course the argument from this point of view is that a special school can have staff specially trained to deal with that kind of child, the sort of resources that they need, the protective environment that's necessary for certain <tag>disabilities</>,   

700115
Of the pensioners, nearly three-fifths lived in council houses. 
Overall just above half of all residents lived in their own homes. 
The researchers were surprised to find nearly a quarter of respondents replying that at least one member of the household had a <tag>disability</> &dash. anything from heart conditions and chest problems to major disability and brain damage.   

700116
Without such protection, Labour will argue, the cash could be diverted to other ends. 
Funds intended for implementing the 1986 Disabled Persons Act had already been misdirected by some authorities &dash. including the one paying its road crews. 
Neither Labour nor the Royal Association for <tag>Disability</> and Rehabilitation, which confirmed the report, would name the authority concerned.   

700117
But despite criticism by the Pearson Commission that social security benefits could not realistically be likened to fruits of individual thrift and that the purpose of damages was compensation of loss rather than punishment of wrongdoing,{fo id=84} the recommended deletion of this `privilege" has little chance of implementation in the absence of substantial corresponding increases in the value of the social security benefits. 
The courts, for their part, have insisted that plaintiffs cannot claim for free medical services under National Health or for wages or <tag>disability</> pay from employers,{fo id=85} because such benefits would have precluded any loss being incurred. 

700118
All but three of the no-tort statutes employ thresholds expressed in dollars of medical expense, ranging from $500 to $5,000. 
A second type of threshold is linked to days of <tag>disability</>.

Oxford City Council requires organisations to fulfil a series of obligations in order to be considered for grants. 
Membership should be cheap enough for everybody to join and disadvantaged groups, such as people with <tag>disabilities</>, should be encouraged to participate.

She was taken to a mental hospital and was later committed. 
Miss Lewis died from pneumonia due to emaciation and a brain <tag>disability</>.

The case then went forward to the European Court of Human Rights. 
If Rees had been successful there, it would have meant that legislation would have had to be introduced into Parliament which would remove those legal <tag>disabilities</> affecting transsexuals which the court may find contravene the Convention.   

700123
In terms of class background, some of these factors are more sharply tilted than others &dash. and not all the same way. 
Thus those who were in middle-class occupations will almost certainly enjoy larger pensions and more comfortable houses, and they can expect to suffer fewer <tag>disabilities</>, and live longer too.

As a four-year-old orphan, Paddy was institutionalised in a religious industrial school, and the events which followed corrupt the name of religion. 
Viciously beaten and sexually abused, he sustained series injury leading to a long round of hospitals, major brain surgery and permanent <tag>disability</>.

The inquest was told that 23-year-old Beverley's emaciated body was found last February amid piles of rat droppings, rotting food and waist-high bundles of newspapers. 
She had died from pneumonia owing to emaciation and cerebral <tag>disability</>.

Her emaciated body was found last February in a house full of rat droppings, rotting food and piled high with old newspapers. 
The hearing has been told that Miss Lewis, the apparent victim of the rubella virus, died from pneumonia due to emaciation and a brain <tag>disability</>.

This original observation was confirmed during widespread outbreaks of German Measles in Europe in 1962 and 1963 and in North America in the following year. 
Whereas German Measles in childhood and adult life is usually a mild disease, these congenital malformations were a cause of major <tag>disability</> and sometimes death.

In longer-established artists, the new spirit is visible as a change of direction. 
Johnny Crescendo, the performer who has most clearly articulated <tag>disability</> issues in civil rights terms, has performed as blues singer and alternative poet for some 20 years, building a reputation around Northern folk clubs and the cabaret circuit.

The survey results showed significant variations in access to facilities, provision of special equipment and support services. 
Oxford East MP and Labour Higher Education spokesman Mr Andrew Smith said: `The survey shows that current provision for students with <tag>disabilities</> is variable, incomplete, and in need of substantial improvement."

This makes the latter more cost-efficient in that the beneficiary can be left some choice in the amount of coverage needed. 
For example, if he already maintains medical insurance for himself and his family, or other protection against <tag>disability</>, he can opt for appropriate deductibles and thereby lower the cost of insurance.   

700134
The Government must be confident that those people are able to meet the difference between the benefit they receive and the cost of their care in a home. 
That difference is now running at around #100 a week for an elderly person in a nursing home, a person with physical <tag>disability</> and a person with Alzheimer's disease.   

700135
Having a common language, and a sense of shared history, the users of BSL have a particularly clear culture. 
Whether that should be seen as part of a larger <tag>disability</> culture, or something entirely distinct, is an unresolved issue.

Yes, well the new act, in fact, extends the previous provisions up to the age of nineteen, and also takes provision back before school age. 
And when we're talking about handicaps or <tag>disabilities</>, we're talking about people perhaps who are physically disabled and also perhaps mentally disabled &ellip

`I believe Tony used to believe that, in the days before he became &ellip. different." 
The conference approved the Economic Equality policy review which proposes: Ending tax on childcare; Introducing a minimum wage starting at half of average male earnings ( #2.80 an hour), rising to two-thirds the average; Income tax levels of no higher than 50 per cent at the top, down to less than 20 per cent at the bottom; `A significant and generous increase in child benefit over the lifetime of the Parliament"; To tax gifts and inheritance at the point of receipt; To crack down on tax loopholes; Raise pensions immediately by #5 for single people and #8 for couples; To introduce a new <tag>disability</> benefit; To simplify income support rules; To keep mortgage interest tax relief `at a single rate equivalent to the basic rate relief which we inherit".

Ageing has to be recognized as a process, a gradual transition, rather than a once-for-all event. 
In the crudest sense, there are indeed `young old" and `old old"; and although you can be either younger or older at any age, physical and mental <tag>disabilities</> do slowly cumulate on average with increasing years.   

700140
The Irish courts have held that a child which was born deformed in consequence of an injury to its mother, caused by the fault of a railway company on whose line she was travelling, could not recover damages; but the decision turned on the view that the company, not having means of knowledge of its presence, owed no duty towards it. 
In England, however, the birth of many children suffering from deformities caused by their mothers having taken the new drug thalidomide prescribed by doctors during their pregnancy resulted in the enactment of the Congenital <tag>Disabilities</> (Civil Liability) Act 1976.

In addition, an increasing number of countryside properties now offer the use of battery-operated cars for less able visitors, enabling them to get the most out of their visit.

At present, patients are prevented from receiving the benefit for the first six months of a terminal illness. 
The conference heard an appeal from a wheelchair-bound representative to enable the disabled to run their lives more independently. 
Jonathan Hastings-Day, vice-chairman of the Conservative <tag>Disability</> Group, said the disabled should be able to buy the services they need from privately run agencies: `I am sick to death of social workers sitting around having case conferences.

I was interested to read Terence Bendixson's article (5 October) on directly charging for road use. 
Putting to one side the other inequities associated with such a system should it be introduced, I hope due consideration would be given to the problems of the disabled. 
Many disabled, (partly because of their <tag>disability</> and partly as a result of the inadequacy of public transport), are completely dependent on private or other vehicles to get out at all.

`At the same time it retains the essential feature of appointment being by merit only," he said. 
`But it remains the case that our workforce is not representative of the communities we serve and from which we recruit, we need to employ more black people, more women in senior jobs and more people with disabilities." 
Mr Williams said the apparently poor record of the recruitment of disabled people was distorted by the fact that many people with <tag>disabilities</> are not officially registered as such.

There was one consideration which weighed the balance of public interest decisively in favour of disclosure. 
Where a man had committed multiple killings under the <tag>disability</> of serious mental illness, decisions which might lead directly or indirectly to his release from hospital should be made unless a responsible authority is properly able to make an informed judgment that the risk of repitition is so small as to be acceptable.

I was dismayed by your comments that a strategy to combine the promotion of helmets with moves to reduce alcoholism could save the NHS in Oxford region hundreds and thousands of pounds (`Helmets plea to save money," The Oxford Times, March 9).

CHILD BENEFIT is to be frozen for the third year running, with some of the money saved going to increase benefits for the disabled and low-income families both in and out of work, Tony Newton, Secretary of State for Social Security announced yesterday. 
In announcing next April's increases in pensions and other benefits, Mr Newton promised proposals, he hoped later this year, for a more far-reaching reform of disability benefits following the four-year study the Government commissioned from the Office of Population Censuses on Surveys. 
The study showed that 6.5 million people suffer from some <tag>disability</>, with some of the most profoundly disabled suffering considerable hardship.

For many people it still does. 
But art by disabled people means jazz combo Jodelko, Trinidadian poet Thomas Joseph, Heart and Soul, arguably the most infectiously enjoyable show in London, visual artists like Nancy Willis and Julie Emerle, deaf clown Franz Shealy or photographer David Hevey, whose recent work includes a project entitled simply `Epileptics."

Again, a person who acquires property for his own benefit by taking advantage of his position as trustee will be treated as holding it for the benefit of those entitled under the trust. 
When all the possible beneficiaries are of full age and under no <tag>disability</> (such as that of an infant or lunatic), they may put an end to the trust by requiring the trustee to transfer the property to them or to dispose of it according to their directions; and this is so in spite of any direction to the contrary in the settlement, such as a direction that payment is not to be made to a beneficiary till he reaches the age of 25.
