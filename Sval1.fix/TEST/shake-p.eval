The majority of opinion reports from the SD and other agencies of the regime reaching the Nazi leadership point nevertheless towards conclusions about the impact on morale similar to those we have witnessed for the Schweinfurt area. 
And Goebbels's own diary jottings leave little doubt that he thought morale was severely <tag>shaken</> by the bombing, and the will to resist potentially weakened.

Mr Krenz, a former head of the Communist Youth Movement and long the heir to the former leader, Erich Honecker, had conspired to topple Mr Honecker after the mass exodus of East Germans and huge demonstrations at home made it clear things had to change. 
He opened the Berlin Wall and the border to let his people travel; he promised free, multi-party elections and eventually agreed to abolish the Communists' constitutional right to political control. 
But, for all his efforts, he never gained credibility, and was unable to <tag>shake</> off charges that he rigged the last elections, or take back his public support for the massacre in Tiananmen Square.

I managed to get down the last two words of the preceding paragraph before my stomach over-boiled into my mouth.

From the recesses of her memory emerged the stories she had half-heard and loyally ignored all her life, of subnormal or afflicted members of the royal lineage who had lived their sad lives in obscurity. 
Wood Farm, she recalled, had been a home for one of them; the place she had felt hallowed by her own happiness was now part of the sinister pattern. 
She <tag>shook</> her head violently to shut out the notion, and grasped the door-knob for support as she swayed off-balance.   

700012
John Smith, Labour's economics spokesman, declared the party's strong opposition to an independent Bank on the lines proposed by Mr Lawson.

He began to record numbers which were a hybrid of country music and black Rhythm and Blues, previously known as `race" music.

But it's `The Way Love Used To Be" that stands out through an introduction of romance and a gentle, oriental-sounding backward tape loop.

The news that McDonnell's condition was last night described as `quite satisfactory" by Charing Cross Hospital in London is a relief but does not lessen the blame attached to everyone responsible for allowing the battered challenger to continue when it was abundantly clear that he could not win the contest. 
Questions can be asked of McDonnell's principal adviser, Barry Hearn, who also promoted the fight, Darkie Smith, his chief second, Joe Cortez, an American referee appointed by the WBC, and the ringside physician. 
The deadliest sin in boxing is to give up under punishment but it would require a lot to <tag>shake</> the conviction that McDonnell should have been pulled out at the end of the 10th round never mind before the start of the 12th.

This disturbing fact passes mostly unremarked, partly because the repertory is often unfamiliar, but partly, too, because the role of the conductor in pre-nineteenth-century music can be a source of embarrassment.

`What have you got to wait for?"

During the war years, however, it was only an aggravation to what remained a harmonious and loving friendship. 
Tolkien, who as Rawlinson and Boswoth Professor of Anglo-Saxon was obliged to be a Fellow of Pembroke (the college to which the Professorship was attached), dreamed of becoming the Merton Professor of English Language, and of Lewis being freed from his disagreeable colleagues at Magdalen and becoming the Merton Professor of English Literature. 
`It would be marvellous to be both in the same college and <tag>shake</> off the dust of miserable Pembroke." 

700233
It is the Commonwealth that has changed." 
But a <tag>shaken</> Commonwealth secretariat could hardly find enough words to condemn the British statement, seen as a direct criticism and an undermining of what Britain had agreed only hours earlier. 

700234
The draw was done backwards, with the last qualifying round drawn first. 
There was much bewilderment and <tag>shaking</> of heads as the proceedings unfolded.

In his admirably perceptive article on the vandals of broadcasting (21 October), Anthony Howard refers to the difficulty in protection of the concept of public service broadcasting &dash. a duty which falls primarily upon the BBC as a `cornerstone" of our system. 
As with our constitution, a precise definition of public service broadcasting is beyond phraseology and I venture to recall a story recounted by the late Sir Hugh Greene when he, with the then chairman, Sir Arthur Fforde &dash. a man of immnese wisom &dash. confronted the Pilkington Committee then inquiring into the future of broadcasting. 
`Would you I wonder," asked Sir Harry Pilkington, `feel able to help us by explaining what you mean by public service broadcasting?" Arthur Fforde and Hugh Greene looked at each other in some perplexity and then <tag>shook</> their heads.

It has been suggested that the two types of eruption form a natural  sequence, with the violent Plinian phase representing the first  explosive de-gassing of a new magma, while the ignimbrite phase  represents a later stage when the magma has become depleted in gas. 
The situation as a whole is rather like shaking up an open bottle of  beer with your thumb over the top. 
If you <tag>shake</> it vigorously, the  carbon dioxide gas in it comes out of solution, and pressure builds up  in the neck of the bottle.   

700239
This is rather unstable, and it usually comes to an end in a funeral. 
Funerals are very valuable politically, and then you usually get a kind of a <tag>shake</> down, you get some kind of group &dash. in the Communist countries it's the Politburo.

It then continued to decline, falling to 1,565.2 in November before steadying and then strengthening. 
Many observers feel the market, with its confidence badly <tag>shaken</>, will continue to decline and the forecast by Peter Thompson, a Barclays de Zoete Wedd consultant, that the index could hit 1,800 next year is no longer so readily dismissed.

The doctor had been called. 
After administering sedatives he had <tag>shaken</> his head, spoken of schizophrenia, and mentioned a clinic in London.

On standing up, they found dancing to 10,000 Maniacs no easy task. 
They had just got the hang of <tag>shaking</> to a jig or a Blondie-style uptempo thrash, when Buck took a guitar-hero trip along his fret-board, dallied with feed-back and confused everything.

The deal, for the record, was a dollars 30m issue of 30-year first mortgage bonds for Savannah Electric &and. Power Co; the significance, for the history books, was that the issue was lead managed by J P Morgan Securities, the first time in nearly 60 years that a US commercial bank (or a subsidiary) has arranged a domestic corporate bond issue. 
What is happening in the US, combined with parallel developments in Japan, promises to give the securities business worldwide an almighty <tag>shake-up</> by letting commercial banks operate freely in major markets from which they are currently banned.

The World Bank's expanding role in eastern Europe will not lead it to reduce its lending to Latin America, the Bank's president, Mr Barber Conable, said yesterday, Stephen Fidler reports. 
Addressing the annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank, which opened yesterday, Mr Conable pledged `that the increased activities of the World Bank group in eastern Europe will not penalise our programmes either in Latin America or in the rest of the world."

Mr Varey's colleague, Roy Kunar, held tight in a room animated by flying filing cabinets on the eighteenth floor of a 30-storey city block. 
Afterwards he was able to report that damage to tall buildings was largely confined to windows being <tag>shaken</> from their frames.

By and large it does not, and it certainly did not in Margaret's case: she merely laughed all the more, and sang the taunting hymns of her new faith, about how tyrants would be put down from their thrones and the humble and the meek raised up.

Since Batavia was over 160 kilometres from Krakatoa, it escaped fairly  lightly; in some places, nearer the volcano, total unrelieved darkness  lasted nearly two days. 
These awful conditions naturally made it quite  impossible to tell what was happening actually on Krakatoa, but it is  thought that some milder explosive activity continued. 
The Charles Bal and Sir Robert Sale were beating about in the darkness for  the whole of the twenty-seventh, and ash rained down on them so steadily  that the crews had to spend hours shovelling it off the decks and <tag>shaking</>  it clear of sails and rigging.

The cork floats frequently snag on the gunwale and retire from service. 
By the time a dozen nets are aboard, Horace and Herbie are standing knee-deep in herring, but never once does the pace slacken.

The absurdity of the universities' power to dictate the curriculum to schools catering for children, 90 per cent of whom were not proceeding to university, was manifest. 
It was part of the failure of the comprehensive schools to <tag>shake</> off the image of `grammar schools for all".

At the bottom of the garden, Gaily bent to lift the gate back on to its newly-placed hinges, and the cat forestalled him, leaping on to the top bar, tail waving in his face.

After all, housing starts in the UK were down by 30 per cent in the third quarter and completions by 17 per cent according to Department of Environment figures. 
As Tarmac's pre-tax profits could well fall further in 1990, a current year p/e of 7 is quite generous enough and with gearing of 45 per cent a yield of 6.5 per cent will provide only mild comfort until the rest of Tarmac's building materials businesses experience a <tag>shake-out</>.

Mrs Calvo-Nimo is not alone in her battle. 
At night, she and her husband, Pere, &dash. a marble-cutter &dash. get together with a few allies in a 13th century cellar that has been converted into a cafe.

Nicklaus, with one of his `you-don't-know-how-good-you-could-be" lectures, tried to <tag>shake</> him out of the apathy that so often afflicted him in mid-season, but that admonition, which had served to fire up Lee Trevino, failed dismally with Weiskopf.

`It will be a source of concern, confusion and some disappointment, not only to local authorities, but also to potential beneficiaries, if these proposals are not implemented on the date we were given to understand for a very long time they would be," said Mr Sims. 
Local authorities greeted the turn of events with dismay and anger. 
Bob Lewis, secretary of the Association of Directors of Social Services, pointed out that the original spur for the <tag>shake-up</> had been the Audit Commission finding inefficiency and misdirection in the present system of funding residential care through social security.

You will need to know that he will only acknowledge what has happened if it matches what he wants to have happened. 
A massive factor in the profile is that absolutely nothing anyone could say or do would <tag>shake</> his total faith in events as he saw them happening, whether that was realistic or wholly illusory.

`The room had lost its magic: instead of the great sheet of clear sky overhead there were subdued shadows; the polythene letting in less light than the glass.

The problem now was to cut off the waterworks without letting her think he had not paid proper attention to any bits of what she had said. 
To deal with it he let her know several times he understood and looked respectfully <tag>shaken</>.

The doughty Swansea performance, which merited much better than Saturday's 37-22 defeat, was corroboration of what we had witnessed a week earlier at Cardiff and would in all probability have seen in midweek, too, if Pontypool had not been so uncharacteristically submissive. 
Far from the Shaky Isles the Blacks can be <tag>shaken</>, partly at least because they are simply not used to having to battle on hostile terrain thousands of miles away.

Jeannie wasn't heading in his direction at all.

Airikkala, a resident of Berkshire and very familiar with the British forests, made the most of Sainz's discomfort on only his third visit to this unique rallying environment. 
Setting the fastest time on the next six stages, Airikkala edged ever closer as the rally headed deep into the notoriously difficult Kielder Forest in Northumbria. 
On the eight-mile Redesdale stage, Airikkala said he had used maximum revs in top gear on several occasions, another way of saying he reached 131 mph on roads which would <tag>shake</> the average family saloon to pieces and scare its driver witless.

Then Olybrius' fury flared and even the ground shook in fear.

He turned to the enthusiasts for a better world: men convinced that the war was being fought for great ideals, and almost convinced that these ideals would win the war of themselves. 
H. G. Wells and Wickham Steed, for instance, rejoiced that they could now define British policy without waiting for directives from the government, least of all when expressed in the icy tones of the foreign office. 
Crewe House, Northcliffe's headquarters, probably did not do much to <tag>shake</> enemy morale &dash. certainly less than enemy writers later alleged.

He takes my hand and squeezes it hard. 
`Are you sure you're not a Jock?" He <tag>shakes</> his head like he can't understand summat,  then he lets go of my hand.   

700317
Thinking, no. 
But smiling, chanting, <tag>shaking</> enjoyment, yes.

I think there does come a point when there is resistance. 
I mean, we all know that having to <tag>shake</> tins, the number of people who go past by on the other side, and I think that we do have to be careful with the numbers, and even those people who normally give do get a bit fed up if there are too many.

In his first speech as Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi dismissed the episode as a natural occurrence. 
`When a big tree falls, the earth beneath it <tag>shakes</>," he said, though earlier this year he promised that `everybody will be brought to book through the legal system". 

700323
There was a short lull following this exchange, and then the door opened and in stepped the young man who had bought the mice and the toffee a few days ago. 
He was carrying a leather case and he walked straight to the counter and stared at her; then he smiled and said, `Am &ellip. am I mistaken, but are you one of twins?" 
She smiled widely as she <tag>shook</> her head, saying, `No, you are not mistaken, sir; and I am not one of twins.

`But in the folktale, of course," went on Lingalonga Boccherini, in the dreamy, hypnotic voice that had been largely responsible for her nickname, `after she has eaten the poisoned apple, poisoned by the wicked possessive mother, who is someone like me really, I suppose, she falls into a faint and she can only be wakened by a kiss from a male, that is to say, a prince, which isn't really a kiss of course but the male urge to rape and violate and explain away the contradictions of the female, very much as you, Gordon, of course try and destroy me sexually!" 
`Absolutely!" said Macrae, nodding. 
He took the apple from Maisie and held it up high, <tag>shaking</> his white hair out behind him.

The cross-examination which followed was alarming, and interspersed with words sounding like hepatitis and malaria as she filled in a long questionnaire with a series of Niets and Das. 
By this time I was sorely in need of a toilet, and it was her turn to be alarmed when she suddenly grasped the meaning of my frantic gestures. 
We rushed along the corridor to a small private room with a bathroom en suite, and as the door slammed shut behind me a virtual volcanic eruption <tag>shook</> the other end of my torso &ellip

Leaders of the Tamil Tigers separatist fighters are understood to have admitted in peace talks with the government that their members were responsible for the assassination a week ago of Mr Appapillai Amirthalingam, Sri Lanka's leading Tamil politician.

And it is by no means fortuitous that as I write these words, the present regime in my country is being shaken by a single page of text entitled, again, as if to illustrate what I am saying: `A few words." 
Yes, I really do inhabit a system in which words are capable of shaking the entire structure of government, where words can prove mightier than 10 military divisions, where Solzhenitsyn's words of truth were regarded as something so dangerous that it was necessary to bundle their author into an aeroplane and transport him.

Harvard, averaging two stone heavier and this time without a piece of weed-entangled wood stuck on the fin under their boat, could not answer the turn of speed that Nottingham's pent-up frustration produced.

Harvard and their coach Harry Parker, the favourites for the Ladies' and virtually certain of taking home a pot at the 150th birthday regatta, <tag>shook</> hands with the Nottingham crew but had nothing to celebrate in the room they had booked at the Red Lion hotel.

But no one had thought of Floyd Sterling as a whiskery inspector gabbling into the telephone; then the whole police station turning out, running behind and falling over as the vintage police car sped away. 
This went sideways, like Floyd Sterling wore his hat, crossing railroad tracks seconds before a wood-burning locomotive clanked past. 
Its engineer, <tag>shaking</> his fist at the Keystone Kops, was a member of The Brotherhood of Railroad Engineers, who were all white.   

700363

700364
Such a scene &dash. Jack Lewis, in tears, holding in his arms a weeping adolescent boy &dash. would have been quite unthinkable to those close friends with whom, over thirty or forty years, he had not been able to share even the simplest intimacies.

The story opens in Atlanta in 1948 and spans almost 25 years.

The news of their arrival had been telephoned ahead and the boy was immediately transferred to a trolley and wheeled away to be X-rayed. 
The rest of the party wearily prepared to wait in the emergency department; there were not enough chairs and in the end, after much offering and refusing of seats, they all sat down on the floor, the attache&acute. quietly <tag>shaking</> his head and murmuring, `The ambassador will love this when I tell him." 

700393
`Doctor Penrose," he announced, with a smirk. 
The man who rose from behind a large polished desk on the far side of the room, and came forward to <tag>shake</> Robyn's hand, was smaller and more ordinary-looking than she had expected. 

700394
The `attack" in fact  turned out to be more successful than even Jaggar had hoped, because two  days after it, the main flow front stopped moving altogether.

, as a row of knees in a concert hall will all lean to accommodate a late-arriving ticket holder. 
Staring straight ahead, I began the twist itself: I exerted force; then greater force; then folded myself around the jar, and, <tag>shaking</> with extreme effort, blood booming in my eardrums, hooting spittle, gave it my personal best; hunching with it past my crotch to my knees.
