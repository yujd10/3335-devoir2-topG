Then, two minutes before the end of the game, the news came through from the other ground that Sunderland had lost. 
Immediately, the Coventry team manager had the news flashed up on the giant electronic message board at the end of the ground. 
Apparently all 22 players could read, and they all realized that they needn't <tag>bother</> to play hard any more.

`Don't hurry," says Vic. 
Don't <tag>bother</> would be more honest, for he prefers to have the kitchen to himself in the early morning, to prepare his own simple breakfast and enjoy the first cigarette of the day undisturbed.

I'm up by half past seven aud I mean &dash. there isn't the same work to do.

700013
We then didn't have enough materials for the wall so we had to shorten its length, which in turn meant there was not enough room for media vehicles and not enough space for VIPs to manoeuvre their cars in, and that meant altering security arrangements. 
All these complications arose simply because someone thought a smaller cabin would be big enough but had not <tag>bothered</> to consult the professionals.

The 1944 Act changed much for the school, but not everything and not all at once. 
Its name was changed, to make things clear to the outside world, from Banbury County School to Banbury Grammar School: in Surrey they had not <tag>bothered</> with such fine adjustments, although Wallington County School was unambiguously a grammar school.   

700016
His thunderbolt transformed Blackpool's Winter Gardens into a bear garden. 
Goggle-eyed delegates suddenly found themselves with bit-parts in a Hammer Films spectacular instead of the innocent charade their betters normally laid on for them. 
MPs who had never <tag>bothered</> to attend before hurried northwards, determined to plunge their daggers into some of the available backs.

`Nowadays I do some of my training with people like Tim Hutchings, Gary Staines and Steve Harris.

And it's preferable to have a golf course rather than agricultural land which might be  heavily dosed with chemicals six times a year, which is more than the average course." 
The NCC rounds off its booklet with a list of 10 guidelines for course developers: survey the site, evaluate it, defuse any local notions that golf is anti-conservation, allow plenty of room in the design, avoid sensitive areas in the lay-out, take care of drainage sites, don't <tag>bother</> designing the rough at the start (it'll become clear anyway), plant native species, manage the land sympathetically, and keep people educated about what you're doing.

The hard core of support seemed to have risen slightly during the year, but voting Green in the Euro-elections had not for most of the voters signified a new allegiance. 
Relatively few had <tag>bothered</> to examine Green Party policy in detail, and most were unaware that the party was hostile to the EC and proposed reducing consumption in the interests of conservation.

Mr Baron, aged 45, a former Spanish minister, played a key role as secretary of the Confederation of European Socialist Parties in drawing up a Euro-election agenda for EC Labour and Socialist parties.

Now sit down and have a beer." 
If Desmond had drawn in his breath to say that he preferred to stand he let it out again without forming the words and settled at the table with Harry and another Foster's in surroundings that an expert might have subdivided into the creation of one conscientious but not very capable manager, one sloven who would not <tag>bother</> to drop a cigarette-packet into a bin and one Martian.

Husks of rye and scraps of straw were being splintered aside by the charging horse. 
The Lieutenant's sabre was raised, reflecting the dying sun in its brilliant polish and ready for the downwards cut that was supposed to hack into Sharpe's skull. 
Sharpe was holding his own sword low beside his stirrup, almost as if he could not be <tag>bothered</> to fight.   

700033
In late May a commission of the Organisation of American States recorded the PAN's grievances at local elections in 1985 and 1986. 
It recalled the ruling party's old habits: names dropped from electoral rolls, non-existent voters registered, polling stations arbitrarily opened and closed. 
Many critics of the ruling party will not <tag>bother</> to vote.

Then to find all the OTHER under-5 activities we called at all the Sports Centres and Community centres in the area, and finally we also looked at ANY noticeboard ANY where! 
The results of these Monday afternoon treks (my baby is at Nursery and I am not at work only Monday and Friday afternoon and Friday afternoon is not a good time to go <tag>bothering</> people!) were now covering rather more than a double page and indeed was too much for a single newsletter article.

The rifle's heavy brass butt crashed back into his shoulder. 
He moved even before the singing stopped, rolling into the thick rye stalks where, without <tag>bothering</> to see what damage his shot had done, he began reloading.

The coronation of Mrs Heal was still going to be seen on all the evening news bulletins, where the vast majority of voters get their MP-TV. 
And whether they had Mrs Heal or Mr Gummer on BBC2 at 4pm on Tuesday would probably not <tag>bother</> that many viewers, most of whom were tuned in to ITV for the black and white movie.   

700041
Staff got frazzled, speakers got angry and there was almost a fist fight between some of my colleagues and the lighting technicians. 
Someone had brought the adjustable lectern and set it up perfectly but not <tag>bothered</> to find out the heights of the speakers.

He knew the address they were going to, too. 
`So you see I was right about needing that sly G-and-T," said Harry to Clare in the back seat, rightly confident that Freddie would not <tag>bother</> to wonder what was meant even if he happened to be listening.   

700043
Why's that? 
Well, it's something {vocal sound="um"} I mean obviously a lot of people like the idea of going over to the Swindon Oasis, now {vocal sound="um"} we've had at the back of our minds, if it was at all possible to {vocal sound="um"} put something similar at Didcot, obviously nothing as grand as the Oasis, but something quite similar, and obviously they would come to Didcot and not <tag>bother</> to go over to Swindon.

They know I could screw up the entire company if I stayed another week, in revenge. 
Not that I would be <tag>bothered</>."

They suggest that in many circumstances, and particularly more recently, the central problems facing management are not so much to do with control over labour but are much more to do with such matters as obtaining orders for products, getting the design right, innovating, and handling their relations with the capital market. 
Profits for the individual firm, they argue, often depend far more on these factors than on the surplus value to be exploited from their own workers. 
They will thus not <tag>bother</> to pursue de-skilling strategies with great vigour as the return on vigorous managerial activity is greater in other areas of operation. 

700046

If Prince Richard were to marry, he would need his mother's formal consent, and the tradition in the family was that matters of gravity were always discussed face-to-face and in private.

700051
He was academically specific and efficient, a thin ascetic man with a degree in jurisprudence from the Hebrew University and offices in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. 
Manor held the title of Custodian of Absentee Property &dash. the word `Absentee" giving the curious impression that the absent person could not be <tag>bothered</> to return.

I know that sounds obvious but even nine years after I designed it, I still have one of the very few adjustable-height lecterns in the UK. 
More often than not no-one <tag>bothers</> about the height factor, with the result that the speaker may have to peer at his notes or stand awkwardly or otherwise find it impossible to combine proper use of the mike with proper use of the lectern.

Still you do see it. 
If you go to Wembley on Saturday morning you will see women with wide Jari bordered saris with gold embroidery, with necklaces and bangles &dash. all gold &dash. and of course they don't wear a coat because the full splendour of their clothes must be revealed &dash. on their feet a pair of decorative Chappals &dash. however cold it might be.

The quiet was really almost uncanny, as I walked up the shallow valley below Mars Hill, and along the processional way to the gateway of the citadel. 
There were no boys to <tag>bother</> one, no loud bellow'd leather sellers, only a misty sunlight in which all Attica, Phaleron, Salamis, Eleusis, and the distant Peloponnese lay motionless, `drowned in deep peace", below the rock platform of the Wingless Victory.

As they watched, a tee-shirted youth picked up an equally unidentified cardboard carton from the inside and carried it with unnatural speed towards the shop entrance. 
Howard and Charles looked at each other, nodded slowly in unison and burst into loud laughter. 
As always, this last <tag>bothered</> slightly some of those within hearing who wondered whether the brothers might be enjoying a typical Asian joke at some of the stupid Brits they served and made a good living out of.   

700069
On the contrary, they have the sanction of the New Zealand Rugby Union for a simple stratagem, worked out by lawyers, which makes them de facto professionals. 
It bothers them not a jot that in the process they have driven a coach and horses through the spirit of rugby union's amateur by-laws. 
But since when have All Blacks been <tag>bothered</> about the spirit of the game?

The tune was bashed out on a clavioline, merely two octaves long and an early forerunner of the synthesiser, and treated according to methods perfected by Meek during his times as a film-dubber and a sound engineer recording variety shows for Radio Luxembourg. 
Despite critical disapproval (David Jacobs thought the song sounded like `music from a third-rate ice show"), Meek's home produce earned him a small fortune which he resolutely avoided investing in his studio. 
But then, why <tag>bother</> if you can make an echo chamber out of a spring from the garden gate, and get a range of weird noises simply by placing toilet chains and marbles across the strings of your piano?

Another volley of musketry hammered from the French who were firing blind into the tall crops. 
Sharpe did the same, simply aiming the rifle in the direction of the column, and pulling the trigger so that the bullet whipped off through the stalks. 
He tap-loaded the next cartridge, not <tag>bothering</> to use the cumbersome ramrod, but just slamming the rifle's butt hard on the ground in hope that the blow would jar the ball down to the loose charge.   

700075
Yet there is one little problem. 
If one talks to people in Hong Kong, one soon discovers that few have read the draft Basic Law, and even fewer find it worth <tag>bothering</> about.

As ever the ground floor features all the best in furnishings and decor. 
Houses that are way beyond anyone's means (although I thought the Duchess of Kent was kind to the organisers by <tag>bothering</> to tour one of the show homes that would be little more than a conservatory tacked on to her stately home).

I never even <tag>bothered</> to dig for its buddy, the lowly lugworm, because they earned just 7s 6d for 100.

But here's an even stranger fact. 
The anglers do not <tag>bother</> to fish if they are allocated a spot which is not frozen (perhaps because a stream runs in, or a tree has sheltered an area from the worst of the frost and snow).   

700079
I mean if if if you've had your vehicle serviced and the sump plug hasn't been put back in, then obviously you've got a perfectly legitimate claim against the person that's done the work.

Henry Cecil's stable jockey, who spent all night on a plane after riding in America on Sunday before heading to Folkestone, would have gone on to Nottingham if his six rides at the Kent course had produced winners. 
But as there are just 15 days of Flat racing on turf left this year and with Eddery having established a lead of eight in the jockeys' table, Cauthen decided not to <tag>bother</>.

700091
Since she had left him, he had switched the rooms round and now the big room was a sitting room and the small sitting room had become a spare bedroom. 
Rain did not care for the flat, not because of its traces of Vanessa that were everywhere but because she was disturbed that two people who were deeply aware of visual things should have <tag>bothered</> so little to make it pleasing.

Jon says he enjoys almost all the aspects of being a celebrity, except one. 
Although he appreciates the affection of his fans, it <tag>bothers</> him that he can't do normal things without fans noticing.

Moreover, the association suffers from a very Periclean problem: you cannot force people to vote in a self-regulatory organisation. 
Allowing for 120 proxy votes and some 50 people at the AGM, less than half the AFBD membership <tag>bothered</> to register their opinion.   

700094
In the event it was evens stevens. 
The FT-SE share index, although superfically in rampant form, failed to reach the magic 2,400 points but trading volume did manage to top 200 million shares, the sort of insignificant level which left most wondering why the market had <tag>bothered</> to open at all.

All in all, it seems to have diverted De Niro's energies away from the more serious and interesting business of Tribeca Productions, and in future, it may even start to eat into company funds.

He told this to Dr Scha&umlaut.fer, the Intendant or general director of the theatre at Stuttgart, who published it after John's death, spelling the hypothetical name differently on various occasions. 
Obviously John had no time to investigate the theory, and probably he would not have <tag>bothered</> anyway, since it looks convincing and he was given to quick enthusiasms.

Trainers were not made fashionable here by Run-DMC. 
British footie fans were combing Europe for new styles a decade ago, says Peter Hooton (above), who documented the rise of the humble sports shoe via his fanzine, The End. 
This year marked the tenth anniversary of THE FACE, but whereas parties have been thrown to commemorate this occasion, nobody has <tag>bothered</> to hold a `do" for the tenth anniversary of the training shoe.

Initially, the money had been invested in a house in Switzerland, which, when sold, yielded a net sum of around half a million Swiss francs.

The Spanish were soon obliging enough to provide tea and chips as well. 
One of the by-products of contact with Europe was a boom in wine sales, which nearly doubled at home, and a long-overdue improvement in restaurant standards. 
British restaurant cooking had been despaired of after fifteen years of siege conditions until the counter-attack of The Good Food Guide, founded in 1951 by Raymond Postgate, a pioneering bon vivant, and compiled by himself, his friends and any members of the public who could be <tag>bothered</> to write in with their recommendations (one who did was a lion tamer).

Ideally, provided you are not ill, you can continue  with some exercise, even if it is less than you are used to. lf  you cannot manage anything, you can always just enjoy a  short break and plan a date and a strategy for the return to  your exercise routine.

Many will not accept a fundamentalist position according to which everything must be true if it is in the Bible. 
Even theologians may encourage us to revere the Gospels and gain inspiration from them without <tag>bothering</> whether particular parts are literally true.

`Well, you couldn't make head or tail of large bits of them, of course, and they didn't seem to get anywhere much, you thought, and by the end he seemed to be on about something quite different from what he'd started on.

Who would even remember my name twelve months from now in the midst of another winter, unless in the context of some old dirty joke or dated ribaldry? 
The brutality of these questions and, at what was virtually the same moment, the icy coldness of the tapwater on my face restored me, gasping, to a renewed sense of the value and purpose of my own existence. 
I know now that I have a duty to look after myself, for no one else will <tag>bother</>.

Less varied in pace than Uncle Vanya, at times even slightly funereal, the production nevertheless displays the same wonderful precision of performance and, even within rather abstract action, some of the same depths of emotion. 
SOME AUDIENCES are still <tag>bothered</> by the idea that dance, music and design do not operate as a mutual support system in Merce Cunningham's work.

Sometimes they met for lunch or a theatre in London, on neutral ground, and both looked forward to these meetings as if they were occasions of almost illicit pleasure. 
Neither was short of opportunities to form new relationships, but somehow neither of them could be <tag>bothered</> to do so.  

700117
The successive stories aren't going anywhere, have no reverberations outside themselves, no suggestions of the mean ing of this kind of life in this sort of place at this time. 
Why <tag>bother</> to write a sort of autobiography anyway, especially if it is not to be a short-term effort but will occupy several years of a working life?

Daniel sighed, aware that he had attempted to answer all this before, and always to no avail.

His car turned a tight circle round to the hotel which was a Walter Scottish pile frowning from a knoll.

We were taught the Golden Rule in first and second grades, but it was only after I had begun reviewing TV commercials for a new arts magazine and was flying back from a stormy punctuational session with a copy editor there &dash. a time when I thought I had lost all sensitivity to the physical interiors of airplanes and wanted, instead of thinking about the design of air nozzles, to continue reading Pattison's life of Isaac Casaubon &dash. that I noticed and was first bothered by a rough stowage of the tray table behind me (by an adult!), and even then I initially thought not with irritation but with surprise and interest that my absorption in a piece of learned intellectual biography could be interrupted simply by some dufe closing a latch at my back, and I went on to wonder whether in twenty years, when Boeing was begging for loan guarantees and sleek airships by Daewoo and Honda with perfect safety records were taxied on every runway, the humble latches on the tray table would be one of the first things in the new non-U.S. planes to announce their instant superiority, despite the fact that once our tray tables had exemplified the state-of-the-art Murphy-bed modernism of a design sense energized by the war; and I felt pity 
and shame for American plane engineers who had failed to see that thirty years of improvements in the on/off switch, the suitcase closure, the cassette ejection system, the umbrella lock, the calculator button &dash. refinements almost entirely of Asian origin, without which we would still be lost in a stamped-steel twilight of toggle switches, too powerful springs, and rough metal-to-metal frictive contact &dash. that all these parallel novelties were demanding that we dig deeper and find some subtler sort of click or even a clickless but convincing thumplet, like the final leg of the closing of a mason jar, that would remain undetectable even by a sleeping princess in the seat ahead. 
And later in that same plane ride, instead of feeling hate for this man behind me who in his late forties had not yet learned to stow his tray table without interrupting the reading of a fellow passenger, this man who was too coarse apparently ever to have been <tag>bothered</> by a rough stowage behind him, though he looked to have logged tens of thousands of flight miles a year, I simply used extreme care in closing my own table after dinner: I painstakingly clutched the top of the seat ahead of me and, thus stably based, used that thumb to squeeze the table under the fastener before I allowed it to slide into place, imagining as I did so that I was closing the coffin on the U. S. tradition of industrial design.

Now the Pacific Ocean is on the whole immensely deeper than that,  reaching 10,000 metres in places, yet parts of it are speckled with  thousands of tiny islands and reefs, as well as some larger islands, so  one is forced to ask: what is all the coral growing on, and how did it  get established in the first place?

In the drought year of 1976 and in this summer, too, many trees were stressed by lack of water.
