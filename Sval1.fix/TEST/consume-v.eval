Each user should normally bear the costs of the information services provided  Costs charged to users should generally be based on long-term marginal costs &dash. that is, they should exclude costs that will not change significantly over any plausible range of activity, such as the cost of the core management team for the data center  A small portion of the total central MIS budget &dash. in the range of perhaps 5 to 10% &dash. should be made available for innovative and possibly risky projects that no user department is willing to fund completely on its own  Revenue received from users by the data center should become discretionary `revolving" funds available to support the operation without further budgetary approva  Costs not controlled through user charges &dash. that is, the fixed cost component of the data center budget plus centrally-funded exploratory projects &dash. should be controlled directly at the corporate level  Standard rates, rather than `actual" (retrospective) costs, should be used as the basis for charging users; these rates should be based on expected volumes and an acceptable level of efficiency over the forthcoming accounting period (a year, say)  Any variance at the end of the accounting period should normally be absorbed at the data center level, with due management attention paid to the source of 
the variance  Variances stemming from multiperiod effects (e.g., start-up of a new computer having excess initial capacity) can be carried over to the following period in setting the new rates  Users should be charged for any resource dedicated to their specific use (such as a disk drive devoted solely to a nonshared database); multiyear contracts with users of such resources often make particularly good sense  Unbundle charges &dash. providing a separate `a la carte" price for each individual resource &dash. so that users pay for the services they actually <tag>consume</> rather than on the basis of an average mix of resources  Use price differentials to motivate desirable user behavior (such as discounting nighttime prices to shift work to a time when idle capacity is available)  Employ output-related charges when a reasonably standard measure of output exists (e.g., number of credit accounts maintained or invoices issued) rather than input-related charges (e.g., CPU seconds, input/output volume)  Charge fixed prices for services that have a relatively small (or predictable) demand for resources, such as a fixed monthly price for dedicated workstation and electronic mail services  Use a fixed-price contract for each stage of a software development project, possibly with a fixed upper limit on the project as a whole  For large development

National and corporate balance sheets are, in particular, mythical constructions because they do not take into account the real, longer-term costs to nature or to society. 
As an economic wit once remarked, the best way to increase your Gross National product is to have a war &dash. the more resources <tag>consumed</>, the higher growth will be, or, rather, will appear.

In a world reeling under the impact of a great Depression, when economic problems seemed so much more important than anything else, it was easy to suppose that a nation would be brought to the ground if its foreign trade were cut off. 
The League had a dummy run while the Disarmament conference was in progress or lack of progress, over the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. 
The afair did not attract much attention at the time, when men were <tag>consumed</> with economic anxieties and thought only about disarmament in the few moments which they could spare for foreign afairs.

As end-user programming becomes more prevalent, these small tasks will shift largely to the user organizations, which are in the best position to make rational resource allocation decisions. 
At the other end of the spectrum, a few large projects <tag>consume</> a highly disproportionate share of the development resources.

Whether more and better schooling would in the short run produce a larger group of efficient entrepreneurs, capable of making individual businesses more competitive, is an open question. 
Akeredolu-ale, one of the Nigerian analysts of local entrepreneur, writing in 1975 saw deeper problems: `Private indigenous entrepreneurs in Nigeria are still to cultivate the discipline of conserving more than they <tag>consume</> of their trade surplus and of re-investing such surpluses to expand the firm.

If the IDB system of financing were to be fully integrated within a revised water authority system for financing  agricultural land drainage, additional costs should not prove prohibitive. 
The ambitions of those on IDBs have been a major impetus behind the controversial drainage proposals in Somerset, Halvergate, and the Derwent Ings, which have <tag>consumed</> precious ministerial time; and they have also played a part in promoting such extravagant agricultural schemes as that still current in 1987 on the river Soar.

Hitler's capacity for self-deception had been profound ever since the mid-1920s, if not earlier, and was vital in order to carry conviction among his immediate entourage about the greatness of his cause and the righteousness of his path towards attaining it. 
But as his success within the Movement, within the German State, and on the international stage grew until it knew no bounds, so the self-deception of the `conviction" ideologist magnified to the extent that it ultimately <tag>consumed</> all traces of the calculating and opportunist politician, leaving in its place only a voracious appetite for destruction &dash. and ultimately self-destruction. ln this sense, the `Hitler myth" was a fundamental component of the underlying instability of the Nazi regime and its untrammelled dynamic of destruction.

One measure of a civilized and compassionate society is the extent of its provision of public transport. 
Violence, materialism, and the self-centred pursuit of success at any cost are often the hallmarks of the car-dominated society, as classically exemplified by the United States, in much of which country there is virtually no public transport and the car reigns supreme, <tag>consuming</> lives and environment with equal ruthlessness.

The usage of each resource is measured when a job is run; this usage, multiplied by the appropriate charging rate and summed over all resources, then determines the cost of the job (e.g., the CPU component of a job requiring 100 CPU seconds at 2.5 cents each would be $2.50). 
Users are presented with periodic bills for all jobs run during the billing period; these bills typically include a breakdown of costs itemized by resources <tag>consumed</>.   

700054
Misogyny, cruelty, disdain &dash. attitudes often attributed to Degas as if his art were a space of self-representation &dash. can more accurately be interpreted as functions of the capitalist ideology that defines and confines woman's value in representational practice. 
That confining definition is the materialist counterpart to the Mallarme&acute.-Vale&acute.ry idealist conception of the ballerina who is not a woman. 
On the one hand is a female body made useless in daily life so that it can become the instrument of the male poet's `corporeal writing"; on the other hand is a female body whose value is produced and <tag>consumed</> in its daily exchange among men and whose being is inscribed by the marks of that commerce.

Precisely what will happen to the results of the study is unclear, however, as Stephen Cribb explained: `The final report is confidential to those companies who have sponsored it, which means that those who are not in will not know the results of the study." 
ON THE evening of 2 November 1988, Internet, the massive American computer network, came under attack from a worm: a type of computer virus which enters a network, and then replicates itself a number of times on the connected computers. 
What the Internet worm did was to create a large number of mutant programs which <tag>consumed</> so much memory space and processor time that they eventually ground the computers to a halt.

There is a great consensus building up between the peoples of East and West as to the sort of Europe they want to see. 
They want to a market economy, and they want the right to be able to choose what they and their families <tag>consume</>.

It was not always so. 
Since the early 1970s, when David Drew started making  log baskets, for which a market was created by wood-burning stoves, <tag>consuming</>  the glut of dead elm logs, he has fought a long and lonely battle to make the  craft of basket making respected in artistic circles.

But with hindsight, the effects of such works can seem limited in comparison with the impact of other, more structural, changes that were taking place within British culture at the time. 
Perhaps the most significant of these changes occurred more in the institutions and managerial frameworks in which `art" was produced and <tag>consumed</> than in the studios.

There were many in the upper classes who felt betrayed: they had offered their sons to be cut down in the trenches, and had been rewarded by having their lands taken from them. 
`With the most patriotic support to the government in the great challenge of 1914, the feudal system vanished in blood and fire, and the landed classes were <tag>consumed</>," wrote one observer.

A pretty poor rate of return indeed. 
Never again, because those resources, now being <tag>consumed</> at vast speed in the Gulf, should have been used to stave off world recession, build new infrastructure, encourage better education and training &dash. at least that's where the UK's #3 billion or more share of the total cost could have gone.

A constant water supply cannot be guaranteed in sandy or rocky soils in a low-rainfall area. 
Fattening pastures, as opposed to land where growing youngstock is reared or dairy cows kept, require little manure apart from the droppings of the grazing animals, as they are not exporting bone (phosphorus) or milk (calcium) from the land. 
The grazier's main problems are to provide leys of palatable and nutritious grasses and clovers and to see that these are <tag>consumed</> in the lush, leafy state before they grow to stem and seed.

Things had come a long way since the old politique des copains.

And Casaubon says of his left-wing, bar-propping days in the early Seventies, `I could write the political history of those years based on how Red Label gradually gave way to 12-year-old Ballantine and then to single malt."

They might be bad if you ate too much of them, but who would be as stupid as that? 
The evidence seems to indicate that millions of us are simply not aware that a balanced diet is essential. 
In Glasgow, for instance, it's estimated that one in five men never eats vegetables of any kind and one third of the population never knowlingly <tag>consumes</> fruit.

They may seem a lot, but in fact they fit easily into a single bag. 
If you're weaning your baby take a jar of baby food or home-cooked pure&acute.e in a sealed container; or dried food in a packet, boiled water in a Thermos and a small plastic dish to mix the food together in. 
Babies can <tag>consume</> cold milk and food, but some refuse.

Otherwise, it's military details (all commentators tell you the names of the horses) and in this case, details of the Queen Mother's good causes. 
The girl guides, dachshunds, Queen Mary's Clothing Guild, a 12ft-long Doc Marten's boot, Cheviot sheep, a lot of regiments, a giant snapdragon, various ambulance services, the National Trust and distressed gentlefolk `sitting on an open lorry with huge silver balloons" all got a mention. 
Fleming is required to drop in a little information, nothing too exciting: the Queen Mother was born on the 30th birthday of the Red Cross and 450 pints of milk were <tag>consumed</> by the parade participants were the kind of facts needed.

In writing her, I drew both on the excitement and despair I remembered from my own adolesence. 
With Jessie, I took this to the extreme &dash. she has a hunger for life that is all-devouring; she can seem at times seductively like a small sun in whose heat it might be exciting to bask, but she can also <tag>consume</> everyone and everything in her orbit.

However, he foresees steady demand for jute from Africa, Pakistan and other countries which need sacking for storing grains, coffee, cocoa and other food crops. 
Sacking takes about 75 per cent of the crop.

There have been no scientific studies to determine whether the eggs themselves are infected." 
He added that in Sweden salmonella had been eradicated from poultry by vaccination but cases of food poisoning were still increasing.

Professor P M Jackson, Director of the Public Sector Economics Research Centre at Leicester University, points out that it is useful to talk of lost output as a social cost only in the context of full employment. 
Where a dead worker will be replaced by someone who is unemployed, the exchange represents a net social gain, since the unemployed worker is, by definition, <tag>consuming</> what he does not produce or put out.

700130
More than most utilities, electricity supply, and the prices charged, represent an uneasy compromise between the interests of individual consumers, the public at large, the Government, the distributors, the generators, etc. 
The sharp reductions in prices to the middle-sized customers that have occurred in the 12 months since the new market system came into effect have naturally been greeted by the beneficiaries with satisfaction, but the strategists worry over the implications for the long-term health of the industry and the economy. 
The lower prices have had a dampening effect on innovative schemes to make better use of the natural resources <tag>consumed</>, and will do nothing to stimulate necessary investment by the generators on modernising their capacity.   

700131
One-third of the water irrigates thirsty crops of low value &dash. alfalfa, cotton, rice &dash. and pasture. 
One of the reasons why farmers <tag>consume</> so much water is that they pay very little for it &dash. between 1 and 2 per cent of the price paid in cities.

Other possible places for disposal are abandoned oil and gas reservoirs and aquifers. 
Equipping a plant to cope with carbon dioxide is likely to double its cost. 
Add to that the 17-20 per cent of the power output <tag>consumed</> in stripping the carbon dioxide and the outcome is probably a doubling in the cost of the electricity produced.

In it, Goldemberg, Johansson, and their colleagues considered the problem of supplying the world with sufficient energy to allow a much-improved average level of amenities to all, while simultaneously reducing the average global per capita energy consumption in the interests of environmental sustainability. 
The 70 per cent of humanity which lives in developing countries accounts for only 30 per cent of global energy consumption currently; a person from a developing country <tag>consumes</>, on average, less than one-tenth as much energy as the average US citizen.  

700137
Robbie argues fatuously that with toads `there's no drug barons, or violence, or police harassment" and, given the rather repulsive nature of the act, he does not expect it to attract many casual users. 
It has been known for centuries that many South American tribes indulge in the practice, and there are persistent rumours that some Australians boil the poor creatures and dry their skins for smoking; but it is in America that the phenomenon has really caught on. 
Despite the fact that toad slime contains toxins which can harm adults and can prove fatal to children who <tag>consume</> it, the authorities have yet to display any resolve to tackle the problem seriously. 

700138
Food should supply a  relatively high number of calories to match our high energy  requirements. 
Unlike some animals, such as cows or sheep,  that spend hours and hours chewing low-energy food such as  grass in order to acquire adequate nutrition, we can <tag>consume</>  enough high-calorie food in a relatively small period of time  to supply our daily requirements, thus freeing us to do other  things with our day besides eat.

The one train where you need to bring a picnic or eat high tea is the Melbourne to Adelaide Overlander. 
Interior notices mention a Adollars 100 fine for <tag>consuming</> your own liquor, but random breath tests have fortunately not been introduced.

Mr Kaunda's chastened foreign friends now admit he faces a crisis which is as much political as economic.

Joe English, the skipper, said it lost them 200 to 250 miles and was critical of the design of the boom, the first of four to be broken, three from the same manufacturer. 
Pier Sicouri, skipper of Italy's Gatorade, also reported a broken boom, but was cheerful about the yacht's progress and finishing place of 11th. 
He was also very enthusiastic about the huge amounts of pasta, rice, smoked and cooked hams that his crew <tag>consumed</>.

These are all cereal products. 
Other plant  sources are nuts, seeds, and pulses (peas and beans). 
If you  <tag>consume</> a mixture of plant sources of protein (such as a  cereal product with nuts, seeds, or pulses) then you will have  a good mix of the kinds of building bricks (amino acids) that  the body requires.

`Is that finished then?" he muttered as the toasts and mutual back-slapping ended. 
Given the lack of meat in the shops, Mr Kuron looked as though he was only there for the roast tenderloin. 
The toasts, the speeches, the food, and drink <tag>consumed</>, everyone wandered off to parliament for President Bush's speech and to hear whether the White House would back the challenges and the inspirations with dollars.

A feasibility study involves relatively broad and quick screening of a potential application to obtain an approximate estimate of its costs and benefits. 
An application having attractive cost-benefit characteristics can proceed to the next development stage; those that do not can be cancelled before the organization sinks a major investment into the effort. 
A feasibility study should generally take no more than a few months nor <tag>consume</> more than perhaps 10% of the full implementation cost of an application; often it requires considerably less in both time and money.

He treads carefully now, each step a measure of the bleakness that inhabits his mind, but for almost two decades, from the moment he dethroned Sonny Liston to that melancholy night in the Bahamas when the last rites were read over the most remarkable career in boxing history, Ali held us in his spell. 
It is no exaggeration to suggest that Ali was and probably still is, one of the most famous men on the planet and even people who declare they are utterly uninformed about sport remain in awe of his talent for the most basic of physical contests. 
He looks pleasingly well, heavier of course, fuller of face, the remarkable energy drained from him by affliction and excessive punishment but not miserably decrepit so that you want to turn away, <tag>consumed</> by embarrassment and pity.   

700155
This may come as a surprise. 
The world seems to operate under the misapprehension that we're a bunch of miserable, unreconstructed eyesores who make the public laugh and then run screaming to the dressing-room to <tag>consume</> untold amounts of Librium.

As the line goes, nostalgia isn't what it used to be. 
The Americans who are more uncertain and more scared of the future &dash. having <tag>consumed</> harder and faster than the rest of us &dash. have typically analysed the way styling devices from the Twenties and Thirties can be used to disguise the advanced nature of domestic products and public buildings.

Just as burning trees release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, so living trees take carbon dioxide down from the atmosphere as a result of their photosynthesis. 
If extra trees could be planted in sufficient quantities, as Norman Myers and Mick Kelly show in their chapters, the burden of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could be reduced. 
The world community should strive to achieve a `low energy" future of the kind spelt out by the End-Use Global Energy Project, with a world energy-consumption of not much more than around 12 terawatts (TW) by 2025, but spread through the world more equitably than the 10 TW <tag>consumed</> today, so that developing countries can enjoy standards of living akin to those enjoyed in the industrialized countries.

Brian Weight, the Chief Constable of Dorset, said it was possible that the line could be used for malicious calls and that innocent people could be stopped as a result. 
But he added: `It would soon be known to the officer, once he spoke to the person driving, whether or not they had <tag>consumed</> alcohol."   

700166
Pagers are expected to be incorporated into telepoint telephones, offsetting the disadvantage of being able to make only outgoing calls. 
Incorporated in PCN handsets, pagers would have the advantage of <tag>consuming</> very little power and would allow the power-hungry PCN telephone to be switched off most of the time.

THE beautiful Tudor gardens of Garsington Manor have been transformed into Hundred Aker Wood as Pooh, Piglet, Christopher Robin and the rest of the gang join The Garsington Players ready for their summer production of Winnie-the-Pooh. 
Producer Mary Spray has made no attempt to modernise the timeless humour in this popular classic which she feels still holds the power to delight Pooh's young fans while providing mums, dads and grandparents with a touch of nostalgia at the same time. 
In Mary's production Pooh and Piglet will set their Heffalump trap once again, everyone will join in the celebrated game of Pooh sticks and Pooh will <tag>consume</> enormous quantities of honey.

According to Indian mystic Osho (not to be confused with that fat guy of the same name who supports Burnley): `All that is needed to stop the hooliganism at football games is that fans should have a good catharsis before and after every game." 
A lot of supporters like nothing better than a good catharsis, and, for most of them, a good one consists of at least four pints with their mates, followed by a meat pie and a cup of Bovril <tag>consumed</> al fresco in the pouring rain, then a few more pints after the match and a final analysis of the day over a chicken cathartic vindaloo.

And nothing will happen because of the fiction that the financial system is regarded, within the non-Keynesian scheme of things, as absolutely neutral. 
It is the market place where savers make available those resources they are not <tag>consuming</> today for those who wish to do just that; and the rate of interest is the price that brings those two disparate categories into balance.

As he has been discovering, the issues which excite New Yorkers are not rising levels of crime, poverty and the deteriorating quality of life. 
Yesterday's newspapers were <tag>consumed</> not with Mr Bush's campaign stop for Mr Giuliani, but with the position of David Dinkins, the Democratic candidate, on security for the state of Israel, and Woody Allen's defence of the comedian Jackie Mason.

Dora was pleased with the silence, which excused her from effort, except for such as was involved in the gesturing, pointing and smiling, a certain amount of which went on, initiated especially by Mrs Mark and James.

This was a little unfortunate, the topic being one close to his lordship's heart and one he was inclined to explicate at some length. 
It should also be said, perhaps, that Lord Darlington was never what might be called a natural public speaker, and soon all those small sounds of restlessness that betray that an audience's attention has been lost grew steadily around the room. 
Indeed, by the time Lord Darlington had finally come round to bidding his guests rise and drink to `peace and justice in Europe", the level of such noises &dash. perhaps on account of the liberal amounts of wine that had been <tag>consumed</> &dash. struck me as bordering on the ill-mannered.

And what pleasure it is to be reminded of that foxy Elizabethan bureaucrat Francis Bacon, who provided a refutation to throw in the faces of the generations of bureaucrats who succeeded him &dash. grey souls who, together with their political masters, have viewed expenditure on science as a cost rather than a necessary investment. 
`Thus, had anyone meditated on ballistic Machines and Battering Rams, as they were used by the Ancients, whatever application he might have exerted, and though he might have <tag>consumed</> a whole life in the pursuit, yet he would never have hit upon the Invention of Flaming Engines, acting by means of Gunpowder: nor would any person, who had made woollen Manufactories and Cotton the subject of his observation and reflection, have ever discovered thereby the nature of the Silk-worm or of Silk," he wrote.

Over two hours, this can be wearing for two minutes it's fine. 
Uncle Buck is the obvious example, but the same can be said about brat pack action movies like Young Guns, family comedies like Parenthood, even blockbuster action like The Abyss double recommended as a trailer because you don't have ot put up with those awful cute aliens that turn up at the end of the film.

A deficiency in vitamin B12 may take many years to show,  but it can prove fatal.

The latter, as revolutionary an implement as ever there was, was endorsed by one critic thus: 
Sarah Freeman has crafted a lively and fascinating work which is an important slice of social history.

The notion that the kind of mass protest that that rocked Eastern Europe will sink the South African government appears almost as far-fetched.

The North's share of the world's energy consumption was expected to decrease from around 70 per cent to 60 per cent by 2020, but in that time the proportion of the global population living in the South would have grown from 75 per cent to 80 per cent. 
Even with an allowance for higher economic growth rates in the South than in the North, the gap in per capita consumption levels was likely to grow. 
Improved standards of living in the South would depend on increases in consumption of energy, but there was small prospect of its being <tag>consumed</> as efficiently as in the North.

They ordered peasants around Peking to increase cabbage acreage by nearly a quarter, offered higher fixed prices, told banks to ease credit to farmers, and mobilised party cadres for the great cabbage crusade. 
Sure enough, production soared, peasants prospered and Peking stopped worrying about another cabbage shortage.
