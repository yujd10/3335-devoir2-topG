But, like a novice with a screwdriver, the young South side were unable to gain sufficient purchase and twist home their advantage when, 10 minutes later, Davie Shiel's second drop goal had secured a 15-12 lead over the Anglo-Scots in this Inter-District Championship encounter at Imber Court.

Since tort damages would be reduced by these benefits, resort to tort recovery by the victim is largely discouraged except in cases of severe injury when it might be worth his while to pursue damages for non-economic loss or, in the case of high income earners, for the excess income loss. 
Therefore the higher the scale of benefits and the more modest the prevailing tariff for non-pecuniary tort damages, the more tort liability is elbowed out by social insurance. 
This result is especially evident in Scandinavian countries,{fo id=94} as also in Britain where the social security system is now recognized as the `senior partner" to tort as a source of <tag>accident</> compensation.
