Some may see this as a two-horse race, but neither Wishlon nor Magnus Pym can be ruled out. 
The 1988 champion hurdler, Celtic Shot (2.50) is due to make his first appearance over fences and the seven-year-old, who has schooled brilliantly at home, could be the second leg of a double for Charlie Brooks initiated by <tag>Bitter</> Buck (2.20), whom the trainer believes could be his best horse.

MR GIULIO ANDREOTTI, who has been Prime Minister of Italy on five occasions, was asked by President Francesco Cossiga to try to form a government and end the country's 51-day-old political crisis. 
President Cossiga asked Mr Andreotti, who is 70, to try to overcome and <tag>bitter</> party squabbling which has left a political vacuum since the coalition of the former Prime Minister, Mr Ciriaco De Mita, collapsed on May 19.

And, in 1982, the Queen, offered a large sum of money for Height Of Fashion, had to choose between ownership of a boat-sized three-year-old filly that she was unable to mate to her best advantage and who might not be a good broodmare anyway, or West Ilsley Stables. 
She chose the bricks and mortar and watched as Height Of Fashion, consorting with the best stallions in the world, produced Alwasmi, Unfuwain, Nashwan and Mukddaam.

But, with Iago, Nunn has opted for a congruence of scales. 
He has decided that the reason Iago proffers for his villainy (especially the absurd idea that both Casio and Othello have slept with his wife) are genuine, if deranged convictions, rather than the dispassionately improvised rationalisations of a mind that cannot even account to itself for its limitless evil. 
Accordingly, <tag>bitter</>, accusing looks flash between McKellen and Zoe Wanamaker's excellent, bleakly disillusioned Emilia.

The documents were smuggled to the Soviet Union after each committee meeting to avoid the attention of the British secret service. 
They chronicle Stalin's control over the British party in the 1930s and 1940s, and the <tag>bitter</> quarrels which Soviet interference caused.

It was the first such violence in the campaign for Nicaragua's general elections.

But more generally the shame of not being like Japan has now been reinforced by the shame of not being like Romania. 
This humiliation has given rise to an array of <tag>bitter</> jokes, reversing the official slogans from the Maoist past.

`I have nothing against you personally," she told me quietly, `but that was one of the happiest days in my life &dash. we almost brought the Thatcher Government down."

Leonard the colourful master craftsman, an Olympic gold medallist, was fully installed as an American hero, the antithesis of a man some called El Animal. 
Leonard, astonishingly, chose to fight on Duran's terms as though determined to prove he has as much heart for the raw extremities of boxing; after 15 rounds, the exchanges unrelentingly <tag>bitter</>, Duran was declared the new champion.   

700308
The granting of a pay formula resolved these grievances and the Police Federation dropped its campaign for the right to strike for police staff. 
The contrast between the mere two-hour acrimony-free negotiation in the recent fire service settlement and the <tag>bitter</> months of conflict in the ambulance service is a startling one.   

700309
AUTUMN is a season of hope, but winter is the time of harsh reality and whatever the calendar may say, winter came this past week to the National Football League. 
It came with <tag>bitter</> cold in Cleveland, where coaches and referees wore hoods and parkas, and with windy snow in Pittsburgh where the artificial surface had to be ploughed at half-time.   

700310
Alan Bloom, who had helped implement the scene described by Ennion, and was  unusual in being both a practical man and a writer, published The Farm in the  Fen in 1944. 
He conveys with a sure sense of atmosphere and detail the satisfaction of getting a job done, the feeling of being within a tradition of a long line of  settlers of the land, and the sheer hard work which  that entails: from persuading recalcitrant committees to support his endeavours to the literally  back-breaking labour of dragging obstinate lumps  of bog oak out of the peat to facilitate ploughing. 
One morning, Bloom records, after `a particularly  <tag>bitter</> struggle with an oak", a Cambridge student  came wheeling his bicycle up the drove-way.   

700311
Only one, President Franklin Roosevelt, who had two such meetings. 
One was with Winston Churchill in 1941 off Newfoundland, the second was in 1945 with King Farouk, Emperor Haile Selassie and King Ibn Saud on an American destroyer in the Great <tag>Bitter</> Lake, near Cairo.

Indeed, they almost blew a lead of 19 points. 
On a <tag>bitter</> afternoon, bitterness of another kind crept in when the Scottish prop, Stephen Baird, became trapped at the bottom of a ruck.   

700313
Oh yes, and he had named his boat after a saint. 
He did not say if she had crossed his mind in the intervening years but she must have, an image now and then, a thread of vexation about the <tag>bitter</> bilious letter she had sent to his home and was read, oh yes, read, and the nicer moment too, at a house party, at dusk in a grand house, all the ladies weighted with jewels, and catching sight of someone just like her with a flower in her hair, a bit of bougainvillea picked off a tree; or being alone in a strange city and looking out onto a harbour with its necklace of lights, lights glinting &dash. so many eyes stuck into the mountain of night &dash. and wishing she would appear by his side.

As secretary of the Christian Democrats, Zaccagnini was in the agonising position of having to maintain a tough stance against surrender to the kidnappers while knowing that his friend was doomed.

Land exercises are being cut, while Soviet warships are spending more time in port. 
Barely a week passes without a call in the progressive press for the ultimate heresy: replacement of the 4.5-million-strong, mainly conscript army with a well-equipped and flexible professional force only half the size &dash. despite warnings from General Dmitri Yazov, the Defence Minister, that such a measure might add 5bn roubles ( #5bn) to a military budget due to be cut 14 per cent between 1990 and 1991. 
These are <tag>bitter</> times indeed for the Soviet Army. 

700317
He was also sure of wide support in his attack on facilities at Yorkshire's ground, a regular cause of criticism in recent years but one about which the committee can make only a limited response in that Yorkshire do not own a ground of their own. 
The club's patron, the Duchess of Kent, will attend the biennial dinner in Sheffield tonight and in deference to HRH a 24-hour truce will be called, although if Boycott is there (he rarely attends this function) it might be no more than a Lebanese-style ceasefire. 
THE COMFORTABLE lifestyle of the expatriates here has been disrupted by a <tag>bitter</> dispute between the golf club members and the owners of the complex.   

700318
Mr Bush has argued that lowering the rate would encourage investment and create jobs, while the Democarts have said the cut would benefit only the rich and result in an unacceptable revenue loss. 
IN A MOVE guaranteed to throw anti-apartheid campaigners into some confusion, Nelson Mandela has displayed his extraordinary autonomy of action yet again by inviting a leader of the Pan Africanist Congress, old and often <tag>bitter</> political rivals of Mr Mandela's African National Congress, to visit him at his prison house in Paarl near Cape Town this weekend.  

700319
`Dinkins is a very traditional moderate, not allied to the black power movement, but all eyes are now on who he chooses to administer the city," said the lawyer, Robert Kasanof, a long term political pundit. 
The <tag>bitter</> race between Mr Dinkins and the Republican-Liberal candidate, Rudolph Giuliani, rarely addressed the issue of how either man would manage a city in crisis.   

700320
Tall and elegant, and dressed in the black of the disbanded National Liberation Front, she said she had been a NLF sapper `for many years in the jungle", and had lost her leg when she stepped on a mine within days of the end of the war. 
I asked her if she was bitter; the absence of bitterness and rancour and of maudlin fascination in the war, such as there is in the United States, had always struck me. 
`Oh what is <tag>bitter</>?" she said.   

700321
Clearly in such a situation internal differentiation within the group is of even greater significance for those who can and those who cannot afford to lead the good life, or at least the life of the good. 
Yet the drama itself apparently had been both preserved and strengthened in the vividness and intensity of its primary symbols of the community of the elect whose conquerors weep and flagellate themselves in <tag>bitter</> atonement for their ultimate sacrilege.   

700322
There could be no more necessary summit anywhere in the world. 
India and Pakistan have fought three <tag>bitter</> wars since their joint independence in 1947.

`The whole procedure for deciding who is a Jew has been punctured," said Rabbi Shalom Kowalski. 
`They have taken down the fences for a lot of people who claim to be Jewish." 
The `who is a Jew" issue has long been a source of <tag>bitter</> conflict between the Israeli religious establishment and Jews in the Diaspora, especially in the US, where the Reform and Conservative streams are strong.   

700324
Abe considers this, but he knows too much and believes in too little. 
He finds `His <tag>bitter</> friends at loggerheads. / The blackshirts, the bluestockings, and the reds" politically ineffective, so he holds the radical up to ridicule: `Pounding upon an unprovisioned table / Rendering it, not Canada, unstable."

As cocoa contains caffeine, it would have stimulated the Temperance workers on their way. 
The village of Gospel Green, home of one of my locally made cheeses (see pp93-5), was visited by cocoa-drinking Temperance missionaries, although few of the generation who received instruction are still alive. 
Chocolate bars are available in many flavours, but for cooking I prefer plain dessert chocolate, which is mildly <tag>bitter</>, or the French bitter patisserie bars. 

700327
Rea is better with gut reactions than meditations, which gives the album an authentic tone of ordinary-bloke moralising. 
His Americanised AOR style, meanwhile, provides a slick setting enabling Rea's <tag>bitter</> pills to slide down smoothly without sugaring them too much in the process.   

700328
So what happens if a woman wishes to have her own identity and wear clothes which she alone has chosen? 
All too often the loving relationships turn <tag>bitter</>, the easy relaxed atmosphere around the subject of clothes becomes one of anger and outrage.

The politburo would be abolished as would the post of general-secretary.

Sayles attacks this extraordinary real-life melodrama with all the instincts of the liberal-radical film-maker that he is. 
He sees it as a particular moment in time when Americans lost their innocence, or at least the naive feeling that their country was somehow the birthplace of truth and honour rather than sentimentality and greed. 
After all, here were the equivalent of Gooch, Gatting, Gower and co, potential or actual national heroes, not only blotting their copybooks with the authorities but bringing <tag>bitter</> tears of frustration to the eyes of those, young and old, who looked up to them as sporting demi-gods.

700335
But there is little sign that the EC proposes any significant change in the structure of the agreement to accommodate the fresh force of the single market. 
The <tag>bitter</> paradox is that an open market intended to eliminate distortions within the charmed circle of EC members apparently has no room for competitive products from developing countries.   

700336
Through that ceiling was Wilson's flat, a few feet away but contact between the two men had been minimal. 
They kept themselves to themselves in that house, the old people endeavouring to keep up appearances on slender fixed incomes, and Alf Wilson, younger, disappointed, <tag>bitter</> perhaps, fighting to remake his career.   

700337
`What people here used to say was &dash. well, we don't like Waddington or his views but by God he's a good constituency MP and a worker," recalls a local. 
By 1974 the political climate had changed and Waddington lost the seat. 
`It was a <tag>bitter</>, partisan battle," recalls the victor, Doug Hoyle.

Although he was made exceedingly wealthy by the proceeds of Easy Rider, Hopper was still brooding and <tag>bitter</>, but life had taken several new turns for Nicholson.

Mild is hard to find outside the West Midlands and Greater Manchester. 
If you have not had a pint of mild for a while, try it next time you have the chance; it is a pleasure we should not forfeit by neglect. 
There is no more refreshing bitter than this year's Champion Beer of Britain: Fuller's Chiswick <tag>Bitter</>, brewed in London; light, fruity and with a hearty smack of hops.

The council's leader, Val Gardiner, concedes that it could put her administration (an anti-Conservative coalition of Independents, Democrats, Labour and Greens just clinging to office) out of power in the local elections next May. 
She herself, with <tag>bitter</> memories of banners denouncing `The Mad Axe-Woman of Stroud", of a swastika arm-band saying `Val Doesn't Care", is seriously considering leaving public life when her term as a Liberal-turned-Independent councillor expires in 1991. 

700346
Johnston, the Roman Catholic interloper in a fiercely Protestant institution, had finally inflicted grievous injury on his old flames from across the city and accepted the adulation such a pernicious quality merits. 
It is all a bit sad really but that is the way of things in football's most <tag>bitter</> rivalry.

Bob Holt, the chief executive of Tottenham Hotspur, will be excused taking some time off from tracking down the still-mysterious German shareholders on the Spurs register. 
As a lifelong Oldham supporter, Mr Holt would have been over the moon at his side's emphatic victory over Spurs' <tag>bitter</> rivals, Arsenal, in the Littlewoods Cup on Wednesday. 

700350
Elsworth's biggest `crime" was in misleading the Jockey Club investigators during their preliminary inquiries, but he maintains, understandably, that the circumstances of the case shocked and confused him. 
Vets have since attributed the discovery of the steroid after such a long period to the fact that it was a slow-release preparation. 
Elsworth is adamant that he feels no ill will over either of these cases, but he has a long and <tag>bitter</> memory when it comes to his first and most bruising encounter with officialdom.  

700351
Two of the last few French companies to remain in family hands, Remy Martin and Cointreau are merging to create a company worth Fr6bn ( #616m). 
The Cointreaus and the Heriard-Dubreuils, who have the controlling stake in Remy Martin, are already linked by marriage and their family history is as <tag>bitter-sweet</> as Cointreau itself.   

700352
He is also the chosen victim of the army's scheme to conjure a dead soldier `to boost morale", and it is Phil's gun that he finds inches away from his chest. 
In the <tag>bitter</> exchange that follows Phil hurls Brian's guilt at him and the squaddie finds his position unendurable. 

700353
Another suggestion has been to trade off the collateral source rule against abolition of contributory or comparative negligence. 
Inevitably, however, the link between the rule and contingency fees ensures that any reform has to contend with <tag>bitter</> opposition from the plaintiffs' bar.   

700354
Stein has set it in the 1930s, and strong overtones of fascism, the Mafia and the mindless mayhem of recent urban terrorism can be discerned. 
Titus's <tag>bitter</> remark that `Rome is but a wilderness of tigers" could perhaps only be received with quite such a degree of rueful humour in Italy itself. 

700355
`Is," said Paul serenely, `or at least enough of one to sort out that stuff for you, Si, but you'll get short shrift if you aren't careful. 
She takes it with a kind of <tag>bitter</> seriousness, like ex-catholics. 

700356
The result of such disciplined organization was a corporate loyalty so fierce and lasting that it led successive generations of the same family to serve the company. 
Adrian Vaughan, in his moving and evocative account of his life as a signalman on the Great Western Railway in the last years of steam, recalled a typical episode illustrating this feeling. 
There was <tag>bitter</> rivalry between the Great Western and the much smaller Midland and South-Western Junction Railway (M. and S.W.), which crossed GWR territory to link Cheltenham and Southampton: 

700357
So who is the fundamentalist? 
Among Catholics, too, the Pope's <tag>bitterest</> critics appeal to the New Testament which tells of events before there was a church, or a pope or even a priest.

It has brought the horrors of the Inquisition to contemporary Iran, and damaged the name of Islam throughout the non-Islamic world. 
It fuels the enmity of Christian Armenians and Islamic Azeris in their <tag>bitter</> territorial dispute within the USSR.

One thing alone seems sure. 
If anyone in Western Europe is inclined to forget the value of parliamentary democracy, the rule of law, and a free-market economy, east central Europeans will remind us of it with a fierce conviction born of 40 years' <tag>bitter</> experience. 

700361
Damage to Bucharest from the building of boulevards and fascist-style monuments to the glory of the immortal Conducator was proportionately more extensive. 
A democratically elected government will have to decide whether to leave these reminders of a <tag>bitter</> past, or to pull them down and recreate the charm of old Bucharest.   

700362
Take the example of Kfar Kila, a little Shia village exactly a mile from the Israeli frontier. 
In November 1976 the Phalangists in Beirut produced a press statement, couched in the florid tones that were always adopted on such occasions, to the effect that Christian militiamen in southern Lebanon had captured the village from Palestinians after fierce hand-to-hand fighting. 
The ramshackle publicity organisation of Kamal Jumblatt's `Leftist Alliance" denied Kfar Kila's capture but admitted that `<tag>bitter</> street fighting" had taken place.

700365
Pat Kane, the reluctant pop star, is wearying of the predicable career path apparently mapped out for Hue And Cry. 
So, by way of taking stock before the next studio LP, Hue And Cry have rented Glasgow's old Renfrew car ferry &dash. permanently moored these days and pressed into service occasionally as a nightspot &dash. to try out some different songs, a pared-down band and a more intimate style of performing: the <tag>Bitter</> Suite set.

Recorded in Vienna on their '89 tour of duty and mixing established Rollins-show standards from `Hot Animal Machine", `Life Time" and `Hard Volume" along with a handful of (as yet) unreleased items &dash. the most spectacular being the towering desolation of `Out There" &dash. `Turned On" is the closest possible documentation of the live Rollins experience short of having the man come and play in your front room. 
Never one to idly beat around the bush, Hank gets straight to the heart of the matter, addressing the crowd with all the battle-charred frankness of a heard-headed grunt as he informs them, `thanks for coming on down and well, good luck &ellip 
" Short, <tag>bitter</> sweet and brutally to the point. 

700369
To say that we are not interested in selling beer, as some people have done, is not true."

The only constraint is that services to viewers must not be affected. 
The speculation centres on a four-man internal review, headed by the finance director Ian Phillips, and set up in response to the <tag>bitter</> pay dispute which ended in July.   

700373
But the new law failed to change normal practice, and such cases remained rare. 
It seems that these obligations were found more likely to stir up serious friction within families than to rally family help. 
Charles Booth. noted in the 1890s that many sons would prefer to move rather than accept legal compulsion, and that their own old parents would often see relief as a right: `the aged prefer a pittance from the parish (regarded as their due) to compulsory maintenance by children; compulsion makes such aid very <tag>bitter</>."   

700374
It was as though he had been given a woman of his own in exchange for the one he had lost earlier that evening. 
It was an odd, <tag>bittersweet</> night for him, and after that they had talked long into the night, about what was happening at home, and how he felt about it.   

700375
PEKING &dash. China revived a long-dormant war of words yesterday against the former Communist Party chief, Zhao Ziyang, accusing him of failures in political work and neglecting the ideological struggle, writes Reuter. 
Western diplomats said the attack, published in the influential Guangming Daily, was less strident than some of the <tag>bitter</> abuse heaped on Mr Zhao shortly after he was stripped of power in June, but that it none the less appeared to be part of a campaign to step up indoctrination and tighten party control against a background of fear that the reforms sweeping across eastern Europe posed a threat to China's hardliners.   

700376
THANK God it's Saturday. 
I know that today is Saturday because already I am thirsty for a dry, hoppy pint of <tag>bitter</> at the end of the afternoon: an aperitif to sharpen my appetite for this evening's Indian meal.   

700377
Richard watched him with glazed eyes. 
He felt <tag>bitter</> frustration.   

700378
The second side is perhaps more immediately approachable than the first, with the mutant R'n'B of `This Side Of Love" and the speed-funk of `Roly-Poly", though there's little attraction in the self-consciously `poetic" lyrics (<ignore type=verse>`&ellip. your lonely tears trail / Your penis envy eyes',</ignore> anyone?) or the high-handed moralistic tone throughout. 
`Billy Don't Fall" is both the LP's most commercial track and its most straightforward narrative, a slice of gay simpatico from a straight source, with D'Arby buddying for the presumably Aids-stricken Billy when the boy's family abandon him, but advising him not to fall in love with him. 
But even here, with the singer at his most direct and outward-going, one gets the <tag>bitter</> aftertaste of self-regard which stains the project.   

700379
Earlier this year the Catholic University was one of the principal partners in a national debate on peace which was sponsored by the Archbishop of San Salvador. 
After ten years of a <tag>bitter</> civil war which has cost the lives of more than 70,000 people, mostly civilians, women and children, the overwhelming conclusion was that the only hope for peace lay, not in military victory by either side, but in talks and negotiations.
