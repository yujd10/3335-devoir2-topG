If the Madrigals show Ligeti jumping the narrowest and most elegant technical <tag>hurdles</> that he can devise for himself, they are also brilliantly alive, full of contrapuntal wit and imaginative paradox.

Earlier, Barnbrook Again, who failed so mysteriously at Kempton last week, will be expected to recoup losses, but Springholm (12.45) could have his measure at the weights. 
In the absence of Beech Road, Kribensis, last year's beaten Champion <tag>Hurdle</> favourite, is likely to be punters' first choice to take Newcastle's Fighting Fifth Hurdle, but may find the concession of 9lb to Osric (next best 2.0) beyond him. 

700093
`That meant that Ghofar was only a few pounds out of the handicap, so I decided to give it a go." 
Those with long memories may recall that when Elsworth was assistant to Ricky Valance at the beginning of his career, and very much the power behind the throne, he adopted a similar course with the 1973 Hennessy winner, Red Candle, who like Ghofar ran in a <tag>hurdle</> race and then a two-and-a-half mile chase before the Newbury stamina test.

Bajan Sunshine has been at his most co-operative recently and can complete a hat- trick in the event which sees the reappearance of this year's Grand National winner, Little Polveir. 
Scudamore will be riding Melendez and Rochallor for Pipe, but he could find Alphasonic (1.0) and Coe (3.55) barring his way. 
Scudamore does not have a ride in the competitive Whitbread White Label <tag>Hurdle</>, but the reappearance in this race of Vicario Di Bray, the winner of the Haydock Champion Hurdle Trial last season, will be another feature of the Cheltenham card.   

700096
`He wasn't found until three in the morning, lying on the pavement in a hard frost, and he almost choked on his own blood," said Willie Treacy, his brother-in-law. 
And, as if that was not a dramatic enough sub-plot, there was a dreadful moment of deja vu when Willie McFarland, a 23-year-old rider, took a crunching fall at the third <tag>hurdle</> from home, the same obstacle that had claimed the life of Kennedy on that black bank holiday Monday.

A weekly list of horses to follow DEADLY CHARM: This filly, a daughter of the American sire Bates Motel, showed no sign of the jitters when making her jumps debut at Ascot on Saturday.

`All the horses I ran in the trials came out of them really well," he said. 
Pipe is likely to have four runners at Southwell's opening <tag>hurdles</> meeting on Wednesday and plans to base a team of horses in the American-style barns being built at the Nottinghamshire course so that they will not have to travel up from Somerset.

But since 1984, some 75 per cent of them &dash. in manufacturing, agriculture and other sectors of the ecomomy &dash. were spun off from direct state control into State-owned Enterprises (SOEs), effectively running their own affairs.

Panthers kept in touch with a 9-4 win over Peterborough Pirates. 
THOSE who believe that the physical maturity since last season of Kribensis (1.45) has correspondingly developed his Champion <tag>Hurdle</> aspirations get their conviction put to the test at Kempton today, writes Hyperion (Richard Edmondson).

`The going there is expected to be good, which is perfect for Calapaez," said Sanders. 
`The alternative would be the Spa <tag>Hurdle</> at Cheltenham (on 2 January).

The combination manfully fought off a series of challenges to win the SGB with some authority and the handicapper has not been too unforgiving with Solidasarock, who should again see off his Ascot victims, Brown Windsor and the fancied Smart Tar. 
The loudest whisper is for Mount Parson, who has been showing Andy Turnell much of the sparkle that made him one of Ireland's brightest hopes two seasons ago, but if Solidasarock is to be ground down it could be the lightly weighted Polyfemus who does it. 
Akehurst and Harvey are not without a chance of taking the second most valuable prize on the card, the L'Oreal <tag>Hurdle</>, with Ringyboy.

The South African government has lifted the state of emergency in three of the country's four provinces and also lifted the ban on the African National Congress. 
THE first talks of substance between Salvadorean rebels and government representatives open today in Mexico with military issues high on the agenda. 
Demilitarisation and an end to the impunity enjoyed by military officers implicated in civilian killings are regarded as the greatest <tag>hurdles</> to a negotiated end to the 10-year civil war that has killed over 70,000 Salvadoreans.

PETER SCUDAMORE'S search for the 1,139th winner that would have established him as jump racing's most prolific jockey was temporarily shelved at Towcester yesterday when he fell in the opening race. 
The champion jockey, who equalled John Francome's tally on Wednesday, had to postpone the toasts when Bar Fly, the evens favourite, capsized at the final flight of a novice <tag>hurdle</>.

`See You Then is in great form and he looks magnificent," Nicky Henderson, his trainer, said yesterday.

Gone are the chances of retaining the Gold Cup, Simon Wigg bowed out of he world championship and the slim chance of retaining their hold on the Sunbrite League title took a knock when they lost out to favourites Reading after a typical speedway argy-bargy last week. 
Oxford earlier lost out in the Premiership final, were knocked out of the Speedway Star KO Cup at the first <tag>hurdle</>, and now have only the league title to bale out their season.

`The race is on the agenda for Morley Street, but it depends how he fares at Chesptow," said a spokeswoman for the stable. 
The sponsors also bet: 12-1 Out of Range, Toranfield and Vicario Di Bray, 16-1 others. 
Next winter will be even busier in the jumping world, as Haydock Park have announced plans for a #15,000 Grade 2 <tag>Hurdle</> over two and a half miles, followed by a #60,000 Grade 1 Chase over the same distance a month later.

I've never seen anything like it.

At the moment I'm keeping all the options open for him. 
He runs next at Chepstow in a fortnight's time and then he could go for the Champion or the Stayers" Hurdle at the Festival or he might go chasing instead." 
Incidentally, reports that See You Then, winner of three successive Champion <tag>Hurdles</> from 1985-87, is back to something like his best and being lined up for a record fourth title shot are way over the top.

The task before Gregory and Great Britain this autumn is to show that the isolated success in Sydney was not misleading.

JOCKEY Richard Dunwoody, who landed the Champion Hurdle yesterday on Kribensis, bids to complete a famous double tomorrow when he rides National Hunt's favourite racehorse Desert Orchid in the Cheltenham Gold Cup, writes RUSSELL SMITH. 
Dunwoody became one of a select band of jockeys to have ridden the winners of the Grand National, Gold Cup and Champion <tag>Hurdle</> with victory on Kribensis.   

700122
It was as well that Douglas did, because neither he nor Carl Prean are in action in the last of the four matches at Bolton tonight. 
Without their 2-0 advantage (one draw) England might easily have found their hopes of taking the series frustrated at the final <tag>hurdle</>.   

700123
Though he may appear to be operating on a different planet for most of the time, even the celestial `Scu" finds it difficult to overcome the force of gravity and two crunching falls yesterday revealed the other side of the glamour on a thoroughly forgettable afternoon for the champion at Newbury. 
The fact that Scudamore was able to walk away intact after being `buried" by both Our Fellow and Wingspan could perhaps be regarded as a bonus in itself in a sport where bones are broken as easily as snapping twigs. 
However the sudden capitulation of Arden in the featured Challow <tag>Hurdle</> and the snatching away of a prize that seemed firmly in his grasp on the highly regarded Silver King must have all combined to make the champion wonder whether there was not a more congenial way of earning a crust. 

700124
The Kenyan steeplechasers gave another indication that with the right conditions they will push back the world-record time for the 3,000m steeplechase closer to eight minutes. 
Julius Kariuki overhauled the world-record holder, Peter Koech, on the final lap to record 8min 13.28sec, with Koech second in 8.14.06 and Patrick Sang third in 8.15.50. 
Colin Jackson, who tumbled in his battle with the Olympic 100 metres <tag>hurdles</> champion Roger Kingdom in the international meeting at Portsmouth just over two weeks ago, returned to the winner's rostrum with a victory in 13.39, ahead of Colin Jarrett, his British shadow. 

700125
But within the City, opinion varies as to whether tendering will prove a lottery, in which all incumbents lose their franchises, or whether the rules are really stacked heavily in favour of the sitting tenants. 
Those who claim the rules favour incumbents were encouraged by the Home Office statement last June that the quality threshold had been raised: Thames Television's managing director Richard Dunn had complained that an eight-year-old equipped with a good PR agency could have scrambled over the original quality <tag>hurdles</>.

700128
Balding and Frost have better prospects with Morley Street (3.0), an exciting young hurdler, who contests the Sport of Kings Challenge. 
Morley Street was most impressive at Cheltenham when winning another race in this series, and could deepen Balding's dilemma about the future by completing the set. 
At this stage, Morley Street looks a credible candidate for the Champion <tag>Hurdle</> in March but Balding also trains the favourite for that race, Beech Road, and plans instead to send Morley Street novice chasing.   

700129
But bathos is not a word that figures in the glossary of Dessie's `coachman", Richard Dunwoody, at present and the show raced on at Kempton yesterday when Dunwoody surged to victory on two more grey notables, Kribensis and Pukka Major. 
Kribensis provided the young Ulsterman with one of the major disappointments of his career when he started a hot favourite for last season's Champion Hurdle, but faded into seventh place behind Beech Road. 
There is, however, reason to believe that the Kribensis we saw quicken away determinedly from Osric on the flat in yesterday's Christmas <tag>Hurdle</> is a totally different proposition from the weak, immature individual who capitulated so tamely then.   

700130
Brian Whittle in third place achieved a triumph, a personal best of 1min 46.77sec that gave him the Scottish qualifying time for the Commonwealth Games. 
Colin Jackson had another splendid performance in the 110m <tag>hurdles</>, running his second-fastest legal time of the year in 13.16 sec, which beat Renaldo Nehemiah's Irish all-comers" record by 0.01sec.

The race was too much for the Imperial two man, Pete Riley, who was virtually unconscious at the end and took no part in the final on Sunday against Trinity College, Dublin, who were easier to beat. 
Both Oxford Poly B and University College fell at the first <tag>hurdle</>.

The US move is opposed by conservative think-tanks, appalled at the idea of creating an American constituency with an interest in seeing Soviet economic reforms succeed.

The 15-page green paper makes plain, however, that many federal laws will have to remain invalid in what is now East Germany for a transitional period. 
It also leaves out controversial issues such as different sets of rules for all-German elections in the two Germanys in December, including the most debated question of whether a 5 per cent <tag>hurdle</> should apply to East Germany as well &dash. depriving many parties of any seats in the new Bundestag.

The stiffer Newbury track ought to suit him much better than Kempton and he can strike another blow for the north. 
At Haydock, Morley Street can successfully tune up for a Champion <tag>Hurdle</> bid in the White Rabbit Hurdle.

His trainer, Toby Balding, has also entered Morley Street, while another interesting entry is Vicario Di Bray, trained by Jonjo O'Neill.

RICHARD DUNWOODY, who rode Desert Orchid to a record-equalling third win in the King George VI Chase at Kempton Park on Boxing Day, followed up by taking the valuable Christmas Hurdle at the course on Kribensis yesterday to put himself in line for one of jump racing's rarest and most coveted doubles. 
Dunwoody now has a realistic chance of becoming the first man since Fred Winter in 1961 to ride the winners of the Cheltenham Gold Cup and Champion <tag>Hurdle</> in the same season. 

700141
Most modern fence posts will have been pressure-injected with fungicide which greatly extends their life. 
They will still need an annual coat of preservative, which is a bore when they are all nicely swathed with climbers. 
Wattle fencing, woven willow and hazel <tag>hurdles</> are more attractive to look at, but can only be considered as temporary stopgaps.

The lure of South Africa is great but those who may be receiving invitations to play in the country of apartheid should understand the damage they could do among all those winners last night. 
For the British the best moment came in the 110 metres <tag>hurdles</>, where Colin Jackson equalled his European and Commonwealth record of 13.11sec, which also becomes the UK all-comers' mark.

The Likud voted overwhelmingly to support Mr Shamir's choice of ministers &dash. a striking contrast to stormy party meetings during the lifetime of the rickety national unity coalition. 
Even before it has passed its first <tag>hurdle</>, the new government, the most rightwing in the country's history, is already expected to clash with the United States over its policy of encouraging settlement in the occupied territories and refusing to deal with the Palestine Liberation Organsation.

JIM Morgan's under-rated hurdler Clionas Rebel can jump to it at the Stadium tonight. 
Rebel ran a cracker in the top heat last Saturday, but could not cope with Litzi Miller's flyer Is King who had three-quarters of a length to spare at the line. 
Morgan's charge faces a much easier task tonight in the H2 over 450 metres <tag>hurdles</>.

The ten-year-old won three novice chases from five starts in the 87/88 season. 
LAMBOURN trainer Kim Bailey is still hoping to run Daira Fort in the Triumph Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival despite the colt's disappointing run at Kempton on Saturday.

The EC ministers have been told that if they cannot agree voluntarily on measures to ensure the harmonisation of the telecommunications industy some time early next year the European Commission will force them to do so. 
The <tag>hurdle</> of post office reform has brought down French ministers of state before now, notably Pierre Lelong, who held the posts and telecommunications portfolio in Jacques Chirac's government but was forced to resign after a long and bitter strike in 1974.

According to Edward Gillespie, the Cheltenham managing director, four year olds are favoured with 10st 2lb as against 11st 2lb for the older horses, but Groat will have nothing of it.

700157
With such as French Goblin and Garrison Savannah in opposition, Rustle certainly faces a far more searching examination than the former champion hurdler, Celtic Shot, who should have little more than an afternoon stroll if he stands up. 
Several talented Flat horses make their debuts in the opening novice <tag>hurdle</>, notably Lapierre, but it may be best to rely on the experience of Lady Rosanna (12.35).

The Nottingham Building Society offers 12 per cent CAR on a one-year term investment of #5,000 or more, while the Town and Country Building Society also offers a similar return, this time on investments of #25,000 or more. 
BOOKMAKERS were stung for more than #70,000 as Martin Pipe's winning charge continued at Fontwell yesterday. 
The French-bred filly Wonderine, Pipe's only runner at the Sussex track, pulled off a big gamble from 2-1 to 6-4 favourite when making all under Jon Lower in a novices' <tag>hurdle</>.

The main sticking point remained a West German demand that its own merger authority should be able to re-examine merger proposals affecting the German market, even if they are given the green light by Brussels. 
Britain, with the support of all the other member states, argued that the German request would kill the `one-stop-shop" principle of the regulation, under which cross-border mergers involving companies with a world turnover above #3bn would only have to face one <tag>hurdle</> &dash. vetting by Brussels.

The return of Sputnik &dash. announced by Rudolph Schulze, the minister for postal affairs &dash. eradicates the extraordinary anomaly whereby the authorities in East Berlin appeared to regard the Soviet Union itself as a revisionist threat.

Bronwen Maddox, media analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said the provision allowing non-UK bidders could lead to a free-for-all, with European groups such as Bertelsmann of Germany or Fininvest, the vehicle of Italian TV magnate Silvio Berlusconi, putting in offers. 
Ms Maddox believes that the Bill will lead to the acceptance of aggressive bids for TV companies and that foreign bidders will be tempted to take over existing TV groups to help them over the quality <tag>hurdle</>.

The good news is that Barnbrook Again's heart was tested three times before the race on Saturday and then again when he returned home and everything appeared to be completely normal. 
The only question now as the Kempton spectacular looms on the horizon is whether `Barney's" heart can ever be as big as Dessie's. 
Bookmakers were being uncharacteristically coy in refusing to issue prices on the great Kempton `match", but they were trying to tempt the weak-willed with prices on the Champion <tag>Hurdle</> after Cruising Altitude and Kribensis had thrown down their challenges to the title holder, Beech Road, by winning traditional trials at Kempton and Newcastle, respectively. 

700167
Those looking for value could try Gala's Image, who is well treated on his best form and represents the first-season trainer John McConnochie, who is fast establishing himself. 
Toby Balding has withdrawn the champion hurdler, Beech Road, from his intended Newcastle objective because of the firm ground, but the trainer saddles Morley Street, the young horse he believes could be the greatest threat to the title-holder, in Newbury's Gerry Feilden <tag>Hurdle</>.

Lula, 44, a former factory worker and labour leader, mounted the strongest challenge yet from the Brazilian left. 
But he fell at the final <tag>hurdle</>, a television debate with Mr Collor last Thursday.

With a supporting cast of only five `nonentities" declared against him for the Tingle Creek Chase, Dessie is likely to put on another solo performance. 
A week after his successes with Ghofar and Barnbrook Again at Newbury, David Elsworth, Desert Orchid's trainer, will be looking for another big Saturday double with Floyd seeking to add Sandown's William Hill <tag>Hurdle</> to his impressive career tally.

First of all, Margaret Thatcher will win comfortably. 
Fine arithmetical calculations about the numbers needed to avoid a second ballot are pointless. 
The Prime Minister will straddle those <tag>hurdles</> with ease.   

700173
He was beaten in this race two years ago by Long Engagement when conceding almost 2st and David Nicholson's horse gets a similar concession this time. 
Elsworth should also take the opening novices' chase with Wink Gulliver (12.55), but his hopes of winning the big <tag>hurdle</> race with another of his marvellous old campaigners, Floyd, may be thwarted by Afaristoun (2.0).

Last year it attracted prize-money of #350,000. 
RICHARD DUNWOODY, who rode Desert Orchid to a record-equalling third win in the King George VI Chase at Kempton Park on Boxing Day, followed up by taking the valuable Christmas <tag>Hurdle</> at the course on Kribensis yesterday to put himself in line for one of jump racing's rarest and most coveted doubles.

Announcing its own version of the proposals yesterday, the party said confederation could be possible some time in the 1990s within the configuration of existing military alliances. 
True unity would, however, only be possible if Nato and the Warsaw Pact were dissolved and a new European security order established, and then only if backed by a national referendum in both countries. 
The party countered the idea put forward by a prominent spokesman, Oskar Lafontaine, that measures should be taken to staunch the flow of East German immigrants into the West, saying that now was not the time to start erecting legal or administrative <tag>hurdles</>.

If this abuse of self-proclaimed judicial neutrality was once castigated as the monopoly of conservative judges dealing with liberal reforms, it has in more recent times been practised with equal zeal by liberal judges confronted with statutes embodying (to them) repugnant ideas or methods. 
A revealing illustration was the technique employed by the California Court to overcome a statutory <tag>hurdle</> in its desire to replace the complete defence of contributory negligence by comparative fault.

But bathos is not a word that figures in the glossary of Dessie's `coachman", Richard Dunwoody, at present and the show raced on at Kempton yesterday when Dunwoody surged to victory on two more grey notables, Kribensis and Pukka Major. 
Kribensis provided the young Ulsterman with one of the major disappointments of his career when he started a hot favourite for last season's Champion <tag>Hurdle</>, but faded into seventh place behind Beech Road. 

700181
The Grand National meeting at Aintree has got off to a tragic start with two horses dying in the first race. 
It happened on the <tag>hurdling</> course which is safer than the steeplechase route where the National will be run on Saturday. 

700182
Dunwoody now has a realistic chance of becoming the first man since Fred Winter in 1961 to ride the winners of the Cheltenham Gold Cup and Champion Hurdle in the same season. 
Desert Orchid has already been made favourite to repeat this year's Gold Cup triumph at the Cheltenham Festival next March. 
And Kribensis, who represents a rare foray into National Hunt racing for the champion Flat-race owner and trainer, Sheikh Mohammed and Michael Stoute, is a firm second choice in the Champion <tag>Hurdle</> market behind the title-holder, Beech Road.

It looks like a long-running Kenyan tale. 
Both of them looked relaxed about their racing and <tag>hurdling</> deep into the event, but they would be first to concede that the prize was only there for the taking through some superb pacemaking from Hernyk Jankowski of Poland, who ran each of the first two kilometres in 2min 43sec, which preserved Koech's finishing zip so that he could turn out a 62-second last lap to get rid of Sang and take the record.

Railway Maid started the Miller treble by taking the Foster Building Trophy in good style, before Norah McEllistrim's Wimbledon runner Pacific Wave pulled off a shock 10-1 victory in the Oxford Bookmakers Trophy with hot favourite I'm Sailing unplaced. 
There was a bigger shock to follow when Miller grabbed the second leg of her treble when her black and white bitch Slip Gear won at 25-1 to land the Berkeley Classic Trophy. 
The Russell Farms <tag>Hurdle</> Trophy proved a doddle for former Oxford hurdler All Gone who triumphed by five lengths from favourite Ballycarney Dell and the Kings Of The Ring Heavyweight Trophy saw Maurice Massey's Celtic James reign supreme at the handsome odds of 7-1.

The intermediate posts or stakes are very far apart (hence the relative cheapness of the system) which means that on uneven ground there will be gaps through which lambs may escape. 
For temporary fencing you have the choice of hurdles, sheep netting, or three systems of electric fencing.

Equally, however, I for one believe we should prevent a repetition of the current farce whereby just three backbenchers (two of them anonymous) can take the nation's and party's eye off the ball at their whim.

Punters contemplating taking the hard way down from the grandstand could find salvation through the highly-rated Young Pokey (3.0). 
This one has yet to jump <tag>hurdles</> in public but by all accounts has handled them like a dream at home and could easily be yet another powerful force to emerge from Oliver Sherwood's talent-packed stable.

`He's very good and I'll be disappointed if he doesn't go right to the top," Henderson said in conclusion. 
Having languished in the shadow of David Elsworth and Martin Pipe for the past couple of seasons, Henderson must be feeling that the glory days are about to return to Windsor House. 
And while hopes of a fourth Champion <tag>Hurdle</> with the old warrior See You Then are mere daydreams at present, Henderson has genuine cause to ponder the possibility of a first Grand National win with Brown Windsor.

Those cautious beasts the bookmakers are still eschewing full-scale involvement in the big race because no firm decisions have been reached on behalf of Bob Tisdall, Yahoo, Ballyhane and the obstreperous Vodkatini, who refused to race again at Ascot on Saturday.

This leads me to conclude that when my committee considers appointments to the stewards" panels for the 1988-89 jump season we will have to take due account of this incident." 
In a letter dated 14 July 1988, notifying the applicant of the Disciplinary Committee's decision not to approve his appointment as a chairman, Lord Vestey wrote: `In considering your name we were, of course, mindful of the events arising out of the Glasgow Paddocks Selling <tag>Hurdle</> at Doncaster on 12 December 1987."

`glorious uncertainty" takes on a new dimension today when Lingfield stages the first meeting to take place on an all-weather track in Britain. 
Moving into the unknown territory of Lingfield's Equitrack surface and the Fibresand circuit at Southwell, which puts on the first all-weather <tag>hurdles</> programme on Wednesday, will introduce new ground rules to the age-old struggle between bookmaker and punter which are likely to give the layers an even greater ascendancy &dash. in the short term at any rate.

This is no two-horse race, however, and both Joint Sovereignty, who won the Mackeson Gold Cup over the course last month, and Clever Folly, who gave a superb exhibition of jumping at Huntingdon last time, have to be respected. 
Trainers change their policies more frequently than politicians and Toby Balding has also had a late change of mind regarding his champion hurdler, Beech Road, who is being allowed to take his chance in the Bula <tag>Hurdle</> after all.

Chester Barnes, the former English table tennis player who is now Pipe's assistant, suggested that in order to drum up interest in the one-sided championships, they should bet without Pipe and Scudamore as well. 
On the more serious business of the revolutionary surface itself, which is not expected to be affected by even a severe frost, Scudamore said: `I was very impressed. 
I had mainly been worried about the safety aspect, but I didn't slip at all and found the <tag>hurdles</> rode well and were very inviting to jump."

With Elsworth keen to extend his sphere of influence in Flat racing, speculation has been rife for some time that he would be training for the Maktoums and yesterday he confirmed that he is to be sent two two year olds owned by Sheikh Ahmed. 
It had been whispered that Sheikh Mohammed, who has dominated the owners' table in recent seasons, would be the first of the family to patronise Elsworth, but while that may well happen soon it is Sheikh Mohammed's younger brother, owner of the brilliant middle-distance colt Mtoto, who will spearhead the latest Maktoum manoeuvre with a colt by Dancing Brave and a filly by Kris. 
Elsworth has won virtually every big race in the jumping calendar bar the Champion <tag>Hurdle</> and many important Flat prizes as well, but he is particularly keen to win a Classic race.   

700215
Trainer Nick Henderson reported that Brown Windsor was `in extremely good form" as he prepares to return after a mid-season break.

Fewer district nurses were employed over the decade, a smaller proportion of the elderly population was seen by health visitors, and while the numbers of registered disabled had risen by half, day places had risen by only 22 per cent and the number of council houses adapted for the disabled had halved. 
Local authorities were having to ration resources, Mr Cook said, with some of the most vulnerable people in the community competing against each other for help.

Colin Jackson, back to competition after injury, feels that the world record in the 110 metres <tag>hurdles</>, 12.93 seconds, is within reach, but even if all the circumstances are right it would be difficult to expect such a performance from him after 14 days away from competition with a bruised muscle.

LORD JUSTICE NEILL said that for many years flat racing in this country had been subject to the control of the stewards of the Jockey Club. 
A similar control over steeplechasing and <tag>hurdle</> racing had been exercised by the National Hunt Committee, until its incorporation into the Jockey Club in 1970, when a Royal Charter was granted to a body corporate to be known as the Jockey Club (incorporating the National Hunt Committee).

David Nicholson earned a fair helping of it yesterday when releasing his stable jockey Richard Dunwoody to resume his partnership with Kribensis, Dubai's hope for the Champion Hurdle in March, at Kempton Park next Wednesday. 
The key to Nicholson's apparent altruism is his high-class chaser Waterloo Boy, who will not now travel to Leopardstown on Friday week for the Black &and. White Whisky Champion Chase. 
Instead he may run on the same card as Kribensis, who contests the Christmas <tag>Hurdle</>, as Nicholson explained: `The ground in Ireland will be bottomless, so Waterloo Boy could run at Kempton on Wednesday with Richard riding."

Graham McCourt can hold him up this time and use his formidable ex-flat race speed to telling effect. 
Santella Bobkes won on this card a year ago and can repeat the trick, this time in the Radcot Handicap <tag>Hurdle</>.

This season Nicol has not played a full game since mid-October and with the injuries to Alan Hansen, Gary Gillespie, Barry Venison and now Barnes (along with the departure of John Aldridge) the cupboard is looking bare. 
THE MOST fiercely contested race at Cheltenham on Saturday took place inside the grandstand after Beech Road signalled his continuing dominance of the <tag>hurdles</> scene with a copper-bottomed comeback behind Cruising Altitude in the Bula Hurdle.

Kameo Style, successful in his last three races, will be asked to do his bit for the stable on Tuesday with Jonathan Lodder in the saddle. 
Among Ireland's top hurdlers, Elementary was backed earlier this week for The Ladbroke at Leopardstown in two weeks time, and failed by only a head to concede 5lb to Grabel in the #25,000 Bookmakers <tag>Hurdle</> at the same course yesterday.

He moves so well, using his hind legs rather like a hare." 
The gelding, despite being far from peak fitness, is already making some of his work companions look like tortoises on the Weyhill gallops, but his raw power is matched by the fluency of Morley Street, beaten only once in six outings over timber last year and the prospective Champion <tag>Hurdle</> mount of Jimmy Frost.

However, for those who feel compelled to open their wallets for this wicked looking handicap, the West Country-trained Gods Fox (2.0), who showed signs of recapturing his decent Irish form at Newton Abbot recently, could reward each-way support at juicy odds. 
No fancy prices will be available about Decided (next best 12.30) at the start of the afternoon, but Henrietta Knight's six-year-old should make the switch to fences with distinction. 
There are four chasing winners in the field, but on his <tag>hurdles</> form Decided could pick up the opposition and carry them. 

700243
When he is on song, the seven-year-old does look the part in every way. 
Only Dawn Run has managed to complete the Champion Hurdle-Gold Cup double, but Celtic Shot, the 1988 <tag>hurdles</> king, must have excellent prospects of emulating her as he sets off on his new career over fences.   

700244
The matter is complicated by the fact that under our present system judges usually come from the upper middle class. 
The legal profession has been so organised that it is difficult for the proverbial `child of poor but honest parents" to enter it and until recently (legal aid has made a difference) very hard to survive the lean early years and become one of the senior members of the Bar. 
Even if someone of exceptional ability surmounts these <tag>hurdles</>, the restricted way of life at the Bar may be a handicap rather than a qualification for the bench. 

700245
Ironically, that loss to Real may have prolonged Toshack's tenancy at the Bernabeu. 
Having been brought in from Bilbao's Basque rivals, Real Sociedad, at the start of the season to bring the European Cup back to Madrid, Toshack himself felt the vultures begin to close in when Real fell at the second <tag>hurdle</> of the Champions Cup to Milan.

TWO racing careers get under way at Warwick today, another is set to continue after an enforced break, while yet another came to a light-hearted close on Saturday. 
At Warwick, conditional jockeys Steve Harris and Oliver Grimwood will be looking forward to their first public rides, in the appropriately named Youngsters Selling <tag>Hurdle</>.   

700248
Lapierre also won the European Free Handicap, but later became known as a thorough rogue, earning this dismissive epitaph in a well-known trade publication: `One to leave alone." 
Calapaez made a promising reappearance at Ascot on Saturday when chasing home Toby Balding's Forest Sun over two miles. 
Brooke Sanders yesterday decided to pitch Calapaez in against Kribensis and Osric in the Christmas <tag>Hurdle</>, also at Kempton, on Wednesday.

The one to take full advantage of any lapse by Hitchcock, though, could be the top weight, Steeple View. 
Oliver Sherwood and Jamie Osborne, trainer and jockey of Steeple View, supply the most attractive bet of the afternoon in another slightly disappointing individual, REBEL SONG (nap 2.35). 
Winner of the Sun Alliance <tag>Hurdle</> at the Cheltenham Festival two seasons ago, Rebel Song's transition to chasing proved very costly for his supporters, but Sherwood has never lost faith in him.   

700254
JIMMY FitzGerald is keeping his options open for Rapier Thrust who could run at either Haydock Park or Market Rasen on Saturday. 
The Cheltenham-bound eight-year-old will probably run in Haydock's Timeform Chase providing the ground is `reasonable", but will otherwise contest a handicap chase at Market Rasen. 
Rapier Thrust, fourth behind Invasion on his <tag>hurdles</> reappearance at Nottingham, will then go either for the Cathcart, Coral Golden Hurdle final or the Mildmay of Flete Challenge Cup.

This season Nicol has not played a full game since mid-October and with the injuries to Alan Hansen, Gary Gillespie, Barry Venison and now Barnes (along with the departure of John Aldridge) the cupboard is looking bare. 
THE MOST fiercely contested race at Cheltenham on Saturday took place inside the grandstand after Beech Road signalled his continuing dominance of the hurdles scene with a copper-bottomed comeback behind Cruising Altitude in the Bula Hurdle. 
Wally Pyrah, the representative of Coral, reported desperate punters galloping insanely up the five flights of stairs to his firm's box to carve themselves a slice of the 5-1 being offered about Beech Road retaining his Champion <tag>Hurdle</> crown next March.

Punters contemplating taking the hard way down from the grandstand could find salvation through the highly-rated Young Pokey (3.0). 
This one has yet to jump hurdles in public but by all accounts has handled them like a dream at home and could easily be yet another powerful force to emerge from Oliver Sherwood's talent-packed stable.

An hour later on Espy, also trained by Charlie Brooks, the scenario was totally different as Scudamore looked to have no chance of catching Richard Dunwoody's mount, Granny's Bay, in the novices' chase. 
However, a magnificent finishing effort from the champion managed to turn a three-length deficit at the last fence into victory. 
Dunwoody found an immediate opportunity to thumb his nose for a change when he rode the newcomer, City Index, to a five-length win over Scudamore's mount, In-Keeping, the 2-5 favourite in the featured Merit <tag>Hurdle</>.

While the falls were bruising enough, possibly Scudamore's biggest `downer" was his defeat on Silver King who, at 80,000 guineas is by far the most expensive representative of the Pipe-Scudamore racing club. 
Silver King looked in a different league to the opposition as he approached the last flight clear and cantering. 
Even a clumsy clearance at that <tag>hurdle</> left him well ahead, but suddenly the 50-1 `no hoper" Star Of The Glen &dash. almost 150-1 on the Tote &dash. swooped out of nowhere like a five-furlong sprinter to wrest victory near the line.

Most insisted on `impact", in deference to pervasive fear of fraudulent claims and the presumed inability of juries to cope with conflicting and meretricious psychiatric evidence. 
Even after this barrier fell in the 1950s and 1960s, plaintiffs still faced a second <tag>hurdle</> in the requirement that they must have suffered shock as a result of fearing for their own safety rather than that of a third person, or, what usually amounts to the same thing, must have been within the area of physical danger from impact.

In the big race, the champion <tag>hurdle</>, the favourite,  {inaudible seconds=1} was well beaten.

At first sight, it seems arguable that the restrictions would meet this requirement following Megarry's decision that no unlawful acts were committed. 
The Court held, however, that the phrase `in accordance with law" means that the law `must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give citizens an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on which public authorities are empowered to resort to this secret and potentially dangerous interference with the right to respect for private life and correspondence. 
The British Government stumbled at this <tag>hurdle</>, and in fact failed simply because domestic law did not regulate the circumstances in which the power could be exercised with sufficient clarity.

The spectacle of See You Then stumbling and staggering off the track in pain on 25 February, 1988, was not for the weak-stomached, but the serious hind leg injury he sustained that day has healed with unexpected speed and thoroughness.

Dow's yard at Epsom has sent PRECOCIOUSLY (nap 1.15) to compete in better races than this seller in her two <tag>hurdle</> races to date and the filly showed she possesses a smart turn of foot when making rapid headway inside the final furlong to win on the level at Folkestone six weeks ago.

The seven-year-old could have been let in lightly by the handicapper should make the most of his weight concession from Boraceva. 
Had it not been for persistent leg trouble, Protection (3.10) might well have been a leading contender for the Champion Hurdle.
