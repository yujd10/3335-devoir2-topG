The effects of meals are easy to understand. 
We drink and eat in the daytime but not at night and so there is an <tag>excess</> of fluid and salts in the body in the daytime, and a deficit during the night.

Having in the past finally established a basic income for a fairly comfortable living, the Government appears to be on a fixed course to erode as much of this basic income as they can get away with. 
The only recourse for the shop floor worker is to threaten to strike, or in desperation walk out in an attempt to maintain a wage in line with the cost of inflation. 
Whereas middle and upper classes have negotiated and established salary levels far in <tag>excess</> of need over a period of decades!

The greens are going to be fast and some of the American caddies pacing the course have said they are the best greens they've seen for our Open." 
Everything about next week's championship promises to be on a grander scale than before. 
The R and A's projected attendance figure for the week is around 225,000 &dash. in <tag>excess</> of the record 205,000 at Royal Lytham in 1988 and a massive increase on the 193,000 who swarmed over the Old Course in 1984.   

700005
LAST week Mail Editor EDDIE DULLER reported on the Government's attempt to put the Press under semi State control, with the threat of full State control, following the report of the Calcutt Committee. 
The comittee was asked to make recommendations because of concern over <tag>excesses</> of some of Britain's national tabloid newspapers.

You might not be covered if you are absent from your home for any length of time (although absence during normal holiday periods will not usually be counted). 
Sometimes there is an <tag>excess</> clause whereby you have to meet the first #25 or #50 of any damage for which you are claiming.   

700007
Trajan was not the worst of the Roman emperors. 
Mr Ceausescu often seemed to have more in common with Caligula, Caracalla, Commodus, Nero, Heliogabalus, Domitian and Maximinus, all of whom tried to ensure that their <tag>excesses</> fell principally upon those around them.   

700009
At one time the market thought Whitbread would be lucky to collect #400m. 
But now the anticipated figure is in <tag>excess</> of #600m .

Do note though that this has nothing to do with the capital limits for award of income support in the first place. 
It still cannot arise where the claimant has capital in <tag>excess</> of #6,000 &dash. and where capital is between #3,000 and #6,000, the notional income taken into account from it may, when added to other income, rule out this particular type of help.   

700012
But does this justify those who see themselves as more moral, or fuller of sympathy for their fellow humans than the rest of us, telling us these grotesque lies about money in order to win us to their cause? 
The Department of Transport's invention about the cost of fatal road accidents becomes transmuted, through several magnification processes, into the anti-alcohol lobby's bald statement that `at 1987 costs, the deaths and injuries from alcohol-related road accidents represent a cost in <tag>excess</> of #800 million".   

700014
Parsons, too, did not normally indulge to this degree. 
A necessarily economical well-ordered life permitted few <tag>excesses</>.

Motorlife MOT insurance's policy provides protection against repair bills up to #250 &dash. including both parts and labour &dash. in order to get the motorists vehicle through a re-test. 
The company says all the motorist has to pay for is the initial test and the re-test and a small <tag>excess</>.   

700016
The cost of making an inner-city school more vandal-proof has become greater than the cost of vandalism. 
The cost of a successful concierge system in a typical London borough is in <tag>excess</> of #200 million.   

700018
There would be great dangers in attempting to curb all press abuses by statute because the effect would be also to curb the proper exercise of press freedoms, upon which we all depend." 
The working party said existing law was `much more capable than is commonly supposed of dealing with what are regarded as the <tag>excesses</> of the present-day Press.

She died of a heroin overdose three years later, never having recovered her bereavement. 
`It's a very extreme film; a story about fame and <tag>excess</>, about people who acquire a very specific audience, people who really watch them and reflect them."   

700024
The eventual settlement will form a target for other workers and the Government will be anxious that the traditionally independent company will keep the award nearer the inflation rate, currently 7.3 per cent. 
Union leaders, however, were already invoking probable mortgage rises as a reason for an increase in <tag>excess</> of 10 per cent.   

700025
A rod-week in perpetuity on an unexceptional river beat may cost just over pounds 1,000. 
At the top end of the market, a prime week for perhaps five rods on a prime river could fetch something in <tag>excess</> of pounds 500,000.

When it comes to fitting the carpet itself, unroll the whole carpet on the empty, prepared floor, ensuring any pile or pattern line is parallel with a straight wall. 
Edges will need to be trimmed, so use carpet trimmers or a very sharp trimming knife and a metal straight-edge. 
Starting with the longest straight line, trim most of the <tag>excess</> off, leaving some two inches for the final trim. 

700031
Perhaps the ISE ought to bring out a commemorative and suitably international blend. 
RE-REGULATION is the buzzword on the lips of the US airline industry, as the worst <tag>excesses</> of the oligopoly bred by its predecessor, deregulation, once again became evident. 

700032
It has weathered depressions  and survived, because the food which it produces is a basic requirement for our  survival. 
Once the confusions and <tag>excesses</> of the Common Agricultural Policy  have been remedied, it is possible that a call for more food production will begin  all over again.   

700033
The exposure draft on goodwill will propose an end to the current option of eliminating goodwill against shareholders' funds. 
Instead, any <tag>excess</> of purchase consideration over the value of the assets bought will have to be included on the balance sheet and written off against annual profits over a period of 20 years.   

700034
Therefore a rich person pays more in direct taxes. 
He says Labour will scrap the Poll Tax. 
That's exactly what they will do &dash. and you can bet your last penny that taxes for all of us, rich and the less well off, will be far in <tag>excess</> of what we pay today.   

700035
The reason why these had survived so long was because they required the most  money spent on them &dash. in the case of valley bottoms, to pay for initial drainage  and then to maintain it &dash. to make them yield their full potential of arable and  pasture. 
Now, with the massive harvests of the 1980s, when the superabundant  corn bows its head along the banks of our chastened, canalized rivers, many of  those who set out to tame the flood have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. 
All over Europe there lingers the sweet smell of <tag>excess</>. 

700040
Annual benefit limits can also be unnecessarily restrictive. 
In one sense, private medical insurance offers the most flexible coverage of all, as you can reduce your costs in a variety of ways: by agreeing in advance to pay the first x-hundred pounds of any treatment yourself, known as an `<tag>excess</>"; by taking advantage of no-claims discounts; or by agreeing to stay in a `low band" hospital, where accommodation is of a lower standard.

I am writing to you as a member of En Famille, a non-profit making organisation that arranges cultural and linguistic exchanges between French and British children of primary school age. 
From our experience, the French seem to be far more willing to allow their children this unique experience than the British, with the result that, currently, we have an <tag>excess</> of French families.

Such physical passion as they achieved at the start cooled to the level of a comfortable companionship. 
Her muted responses did not disappoint him; she made him feel clean again after Louise's corrupting <tag>excesses</>.   

700046
The fact that shoppers &dash. notoriously indifferent at the moment &dash. queued in the rain for the 2pm opening of the new London store at Marble Arch last Thursday seems good grounds for company confidence that the UK wants what The Gap has to offer. 
If The Gap's formula &dash. to produce well-styled, casual clothes in natural fabrics seems almost idiotically simple, that is only a sign of how contorted and out of touch other fashion operations have become. 
At the end of a decade of designer <tag>excess</> that has produced over-fancy clothes at the middle and lower end of the market as well as at the top, we have emerged at a point where simplicity looks like a major virtue.   

700047
Cheap add-on policies, such as the supplements to your motor insurance policy, cover legal fees for `uninsured loss recovery". 
These include pursuing a claim for policy <tag>excess</>, car hire charges and loss of the use of one's vehicle.   

700048
TEN DAYS after the 1987 crash it emerged that some over-ambitious private investors had got themselves into an expensive mess by dealing in traded options. 
There were a number of sorry stories of investors who were caught out by the sudden slump in share prices and ran up debts, in one case, in <tag>excess</> of #1m.

Zola describes the greenhouse as a kind of living organism, female, in heat, exuding sexual fluids and a `penetrating, sensual" odor di femmina.

I feel sure many of your readers read with the same dismay as myself the news of the level of the new community charges for Oxfordshire. 
For myself and my wife this represents an increase, vis-a-vis the old rating system, in <tag>excess</> if 245%.

Mr Sherwood said: `It is now time for the shareholders to decide and time for Temple to stop seeking to frustrate through the courts the right of our shareholders to realise their investment in the company."

Clemency would prevail over the spirit of retribution, even in regard to the Ceausescu family, Mr Corneliu said.

I call this communication from father to daughter `erotic playback". 
Erotic playback can suffer from either an excess or a deficit &dash. or can go on at an optimal level. 
If actual incest takes place, clearly a disastrous <tag>excess</> has occurred.

Heather said, `The mortgage subsidy package which Bradley Homes have put together offers house hunters a superb deal." 
`Effectively it means that all new house buyers at Springfield Place will receive a subsidy each month from the developers which is the equivalent of pegging the mortgage interest rate at ten per cent for a whole year and on a typical mortgage of #60,000 that could mean savings in <tag>excess</> of #200 on the family budget."

The congestion caused by their hurried, and sometimes vengefully random, parking is a source of great aggravation to Prague's citizens, for whom it is a major talking point of the emigration crisis. 
Although police remove the illegally-parked cars almost as fast as they are abandoned, the local body responsible for administering parking is insisting that someone pay the hefty <tag>excess</> charges incurred by the prolonged presence of other cars in legal spaces.   

700060
At the time of his suicide, the society's estimate was that he owed at least #3.8m to former clients. 
THE Court of Appeal's reasoning as it ruled out a legal challenge to the terrorist broadcasting ban ranks as the low-water mark in the modern development of the courts' protection of the citizen from the <tag>excesses</> of the state and officials.   

700061
Mark treated him with a clumsy kindness, but could not help being both curious and patronising. 
While James followed him about with a look of such desperate compassion that he was quite glad for James's own sake when the latter departed to London. 
Although neither James nor Mark knew the details of Michael's history their imagination had been set in motion, and he had been unable to conceal from them his violent <tag>excesses</> of grief during the days following Nick's death.   

700062
A coming change to income support rules will, however give some relief. 
Although people receiving income support can get help with the interest on a loan taken out for essential repairs, and certain improvements at present, where they have capital in <tag>excess</> of #500, the excess must be offset against the amount of the loan and interests is allowed only on the balance.   

700063
The body is normally able to control the balance of cholesterol, by producing more if the intake is low or less if the intake is increased. 
About one in 500 of the population seems to have an inherited fault (ie, it runs in the family) in this control mechanism. 
Their bodies seem unable to sense a high intake and continue to manufacture cholesterol in <tag>excess</> of requirements. 

700064
Some of Britain's EC partners are proposing a European FBI to come into effect in 1992. 
Such a police-based agency could take over MI5's doubling-up role without indulging in MI5's political <tag>excesses</>.

Wen Wei Po has faithfully propagated the views of China's Communist Party for the better part of 40 years. 
It supported the worst <tag>excesses</> of the Cultural Revolution and tamely switched position when signals came from Beijing indicating that these policies were coming to an end.

He arrived to find that Mrs. Shaw had died and that Edward had disappeared. 
His sporting friend's <tag>excesses</> had reached epic proportions.  

700067
The paper which, like Chinese Central Television, mysteriously had reporters on hand to record the supposedly unplanned event, told of smiling crowds rushing to meet Mr Jiang as he stepped from his car at Fuxingmenwai Street, the scene of one of the bloodiest battles between troops and protesters on the night of 3 June. 
Carried away by its own hyperbole, the report described Mr Jiang as `big and tall" &dash. not the most accurate adjectives for a man better described as short and plump. 
If anything, however, the <tag>excesses</> of sycophancy have highlighed Mr Jiang's weakness rather than his strength.   

700068
The occupied West Bank and Gaza erupted, Israeli soldiers shot many more Palestinians dead, and the United Nations Security Council decamped to Geneva, so that it could hear the views of Mr Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation and president of the self-proclaimed but still unborn state of Palestine. 
Mr Arafat performed well enough in Geneva, outlining Israel's <tag>excesses</> in its vain attempts to suppress the Palestinian uprising, or intifada, against military occupation.

One  has only to stand on the bridge over the Trannon at Trefeglwys and look  upstream to see the stable narrow river coursing elegantly between its magnificent  borders of ash and sycamore, and compare this with the immediate downstream  reach, which wanders amidst a waste of gravel. 
Additional benefits of tree-lined streams, in reducing the effects of nitrates and  phosphates in the water and in shading out the choking growth of summer weed  in a river bed, which may otherwise necessitate further expensive dredging, have  been recognized by Dutch and German scientists for over a decade. 
The only  green thing about many of our English rivers nowadays is profuse algal growth  in the water, which results from an <tag>excess</> of fertilizer leaching off arable fields  straight into the stream.

The conspicuous case is Shostakovich, a composer of enormous gifts and awesome copiousness, the only one to satisfy, if intermittently, both his masters and the West. 
Ever since the `just criticism" meted out to his early <tag>excesses</>, then the gigantic success of the Leningrad Symphony in the 1940s, he has symbolized the artist caught in the net of public events.

Britain, once more, disagrees. 
Marshal of the RAF Craig said 10 days ago that `the Soviets still maintain an enormous chemical warfare capability, far in <tag>excess</> of that which they have claimed".

One great gain since the early days of this kind of music-theatre is that musicians now know how to unify acting and playing into a single performance. 
This one had its rough edges, but a strong centre: Jonathan Baker brought to it the necessary conviction to carry off its <tag>excesses</>, and sang with beauty as well as fluency.

No one can argue with that. 
There will be six tournaments in the men's game alone in Becker's native land next year that will carry a purse in <tag>excess</> of dollars 1m.

She asked him whether Britain's managers really are paying themselves too much. 
When we are talking about directors of businesses, {vocal sound="um"} particularly the larger companies, good people are hard to find and some of them are superstars, and {vocal sound="um"} I know we've heard a lot about {vocal sound="um"} exceedingly high levels of pay and very high pay increases, {vocal sound="um"} but when you talk about the superstars and megastars, what about the entertainment business, what about sport, what about, you know, golfing celebrities, earning in <tag>excess</> of a million, or racing drivers?

`The maximum depends on your age and is expressed as a percentage of your  net relevant earnings &dash. for employees this is simply income before tax and national insurance contributions and for the self employed it will be taxable earnings after deduction of legitimate business expenses."

SFV can provide through its own staff, regular check ups to ensure that your property is well maintained during the periods of non-occupation, a service which will greatly reduce the worry of owning a property overseas. 
For the more commercially minded, SFV offers a wide range of properties for investment, including Manor houses, Chateaux, or luxury holiday homes, which are likely to appreciate in value and which generate incomes in <tag>excess</> of 10 per cent per annum.

The permits could be traded for what the seller wanted &dash. technology, energy-efficiency equipment, development programmes, and so on. 
In that way, the rich polluters would be obliged to pay for their <tag>excesses</> through a transfer of technology and wealth to the poor, who in time would come under pressure themselves not to allow their emissions to reach levels which would force them to buy permits.

THERE will be better business books published this year, but surely none that is quite as entertaining as this wickedly humorous insider's account of life on and around the bond trading floors at Salomon Brothers, one of New York's top investment banks. 
Michael Lewis is a street-smart young American who made a fortune as a bond salesman with Salomon Brothers before leaving last year &dash. still in his twenties &dash. to become a full-time writer. 
As a parting gift, this brutal expose of the personal and corporate <tag>excesses</> of his former employers must rank as one of the truly great acts of ingratitude in Wall Street's history.

(Actually, for sheer range of interpretative frenzy Lawrence beats the Dane hollow, unless scholars in some remote university have discussed Hamlet's career as a master spy.) 
Jeremy Wilson is justifiably stern about the <tag>excesses</> of much of this commentary, and the introduction to his authorised biography notes ominously that `Worthless and untenable theories &ellip. have often been praised by non- specialist reviewers".

Men exposed to multiple sources of radiation, particularly tritium, were up to nine times as liable to develop cancer of the prostate gland. 
Deaths from testicular cancer at the Harwell Laboratory were more than twice the national average and women working there were nearly twice as likely to die of cancer of the uterus and ovaries. 
The report also stated that there was an <tag>excess</> of leukaemia deaths.

Mr Chissano's comment came yesterday after four hours of talks about the Pretoria government's commitment to dismantling apartheid, the growing economic cooperation between the two southern African neighbours, and the Maputo government's efforts to its 14-year-old war against right-wing rebels.

It is a rough and ready analogy, of which doubtless Keynes and Keynesians might disapprove, but it serves an important illustrative purpose. 
For when the lack of savings is bemoaned, what is actually complained of is the excess of spending. 
And what lies behind the <tag>excess</> of spending is not a collapse in the character of the British, but a transformation in the structure of the financial system, the harness linking horse and cart.

Mark the approximate positions of any internal corners on the back of the vinyl and cut a triangular notch and trim out the waste, while at the external corners allow the vinyl to lap up the wall, making a freeing cut downwards from the edge of the sheet to the point where the wall meets the floor so the vinyl laps up to the skirting board on both sides of the corner.

Pick vegetables such as peas, beans and courgettes as soon as they are ready or the plants will stop producing crops.

Obviously there is no necessary connection between a common curriculum, imposed centrally, and such rigorousness. 
A government could, in principle, impose a course of study, the whole aim of which was self-expression. 
But because the demand for central control has arisen out of a general dissatisfaction with education, and this dissatisfaction is often directed towards an <tag>excess</> of `creativity" in the classroom, a lack of a disciplined work-force, it is generally assumed that the central common curriculum to be nationally accepted would be down-to-earth, factual, able to be assessed, and marked by a tick or a cross.

The seven-month, 24-event professional tour now extends far beyond California where the game originated in the 1930s and is at present worth more than dollars 2m ( #1,280,000) in prize money. 
The game's governing body, the Association of Volleyball Professionals, has more than 400 members, with about 70 travelling to each weekend tournament. 
The best of them can earn in <tag>excess</> of dollars 100,000 a season.

But it thinks that to rely solely on market forces is a messy way of reining in a big borrower. 
Markets can take time to wake up to <tag>excesses</>, and in the meantime over-borrowing by one member-state could cause a lot of pain for others.

By no means all leases come under these provisions. 
For a tenant to claim the benefits of the Act he must show that his tenancy is of a house, that it was originally granted for more than twenty-one years, that the rent payable is less than two-thirds of its rateable value, and that the rateable value is itself not in <tag>excess</> of certain modest limits.   

700114
But the wording of the `appeal" couched the action solely in terms of justifiable retaliation for the `campaign of agitation" and `lies" in the foreign press allegedly initiated by Jewish emigrants, and the claim that `hardly a hair had been touched" on Jewish heads in the course of the `national revolution" was meant to suggest that the Party Leadership (including Hitler) was ignorant of the daily maltreatment of Jews which had taken place at the hands of the Party rank-and-file. 
It was possible, therefore, so far as Hitler was specifically linked to the boycott at all, to see him only in connection with presumed justifiable action, and detached from the `unfortunate <tag>excesses</>" of Party activists.

The census of 1921 also tells us that the preponderance of women over men, which had long existed, was then at its height. 
Though the <tag>excess</> had been exaggerated by the death of three quarters of a million men in the war, the cause was mainly natural: more male babies were born, but still more died in infancy.

During the past six months, hardly a week has gone by without yet another whisper about a sale from Saatchi's collection. 
Major works by Anselm Kiefer previously thought to be in Saatchi's possession were, it was said, changing hands for prices in <tag>excess</> of dollars 1m; Saatchi was rumoured to be selling equally major pictures from his unrivalled holdings of works by Georg Baselitz, Francesco Clemente, Julian Schnabel and others.

Before the phrase became fashionable, Davis was, on-screen, the epitome of the castrating female, her appeal as a cinematic icon being thus largely confined to the feminine (and, by a probably logical extension, homosexual) portion of her audience. 
She excelled in playing ruthlessly calculating bitch-goddesses, clawing their way to wealth, security and power: eg as Mildred, the sluttish Cockney waitress who enslaves sensitive Leslie Howard in John Cromwell's adaptation of Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage (1934), the role in which she made her reputation; as Jezebel, flouting the decorous conventions of the antebellum South in William Wyler's 1938 melodrama of that name; and as the indefatigably scheming Regina, one of her most memorable creations, in Wyler's 1941 film version of Lillian Hellman's The Little Foxes. 
And though, once she hit her formidable histrionic stride, it was possible to feel that a little of Bette Davis went a long way, her <tag>excesses</> were surely preferable to the homogenised blandness of those mass-produced Hollywood sirens of whom a lot went a very little way indeed.

Horses reared in impoverished environments are extremely anxious and fearful towards unusual situations, objects and change. 
This <tag>excess</> of fear has been displayed by weanling Thoroughbreds being prepared for public auction.

Timber held its own, but needed a good showing from Southerns to do so. 
Chemicals was flat, held back by shutdowns at two large plants, and the remaining plantations suffered from the weakness of world palm oil prices. 
Selling the 30 per cent stake in Harrisons Malaya brought a #75.9m extraordinary first half profit, and the sale of Felton should bring a #25m <tag>excess</> in the second half.   

700137
Witnessed by some of the game's highest authorities, captured by the Rugby Special cameras and handled by the game's outstanding referee, Bath and their French visitors rose brilliantly to the occasion. 
Bath, never still in their search for improvement, had cast the net and landed Toulon, runners-up in last May's French Championship final. 
Courage picked up the tab, in <tag>excess</> of #70,000, and everything else fell into place in creating the right atmosphere for the challenge match.   

700138
Europe has been the issue underlying most of Mrs Thatcher's biggest errors. 
Europe was at the root of the Westland affair, which in 1986 provoked the resignation from the Cabinet of Michael Heseltine and, by her own admission, could have brought her down. 
It was Europe which drove her to <tag>excesses</> which helped to lose her the elections to the European Parliament last June. 

700145
Excess money supply is like a tap attached to a hosepipe which is about two years in length. 
Once you have turned the tap on nothing will stop the water coming out at the other end of the hosepipe in the form of price increase (my italics). 
Rees-Mogg `proved" the point by showing that during 1965-73 the growth of M3 (in <tag>excess</> of output growth) averaged 9.4 per cent per annum, exactly equal to the average inflation rate two years later, that is between 1967 and 1975. 

700147
There have been plenty of Van Dycks on the market recently. 
The National Gallery got a spectacular 8ft canvas of the Lords John and Bernard Stuart in 1988 for #3m or so; a fine half-length of Charles I in armour is said to have been sold for several million to a British collector by Artemis, the international dealers, while the National Gallery of Scotland has an oil sketch of two of Charles I's children, on loan from British Rail, which is likely to be sold soon. 
Lord Belhaven is modestly priced `in <tag>excess</> of #300,000".

A statement said he had `expressed enthusiasm for the decision", which leaves Touche Ross as the sole DRT representive in the UK. 
Mr Cook added that Canada and other countries were rapidly moving toward merger agreements and that DRT would boast a fee income in <tag>excess</> of dollars 3.3bn in the current year.   

700149
He, like others, was put off because government policy was unclear and British Rail could not offer the same salary as could be commanded in the private sector. 
Mr Reid, who joined Shell straight from St Andrews University in 1956, will defer final agreement until he has discussed fully the future of the network and the expectations made of him with British Rail and the Department of Transport. 
His salary will be around #150,000 a year &dash. well above the #92,000 British Rail pays its current boss, but below figures in <tag>excess</> of #200,000 thought necessary to attract suitable replacements.   

700151
The Calgary Olympics reminded us that the Canadians have more pedestrian forms of uplift as well. 
The most appetising resort is Whistler in British Columbia which, to judge by its current literature, has developed tremendously in the decade since I was last there. 
Each of its two mountains (Whistler and Blackcomb) offers a vertical drop in <tag>excess</> of 1,500m, which is exceptional by North American standards, the lift installations are much more extensive than the Canadian norm, and Whistler village now has a lively traffic-free heart.   

700152
Opec's quarrel over quotas is typical of cartels and has serious long-term implications. 
The big Gulf producers are being hard-headed in arguing that most of the other Opec members are unable to produce the incremental barrels that would take advantage of a strong market and that the Gulf producers should therefore receive a disproportionately large increase in any quota reallocation. 
But smaller members understandably resent the brutal Gulf tactic of exceeding quotas until the <tag>excess</> becomes an accepted fact.

Dimitrov is no longer the hero he was.

The 1987 manifesto did not mention the EMS, but made a commitment to `defend our own trading interests". 
Mrs Thatcher said yesterday there could be no fair competition while Italian, French and West German subsidies to their manufacturing industry were well in <tag>excess</> of Britain's #1.5bn a year -one more hurdle to membership. 

700158
`Black acknowledged that he personally profited from his involvement in drugs to the extent of #900,000," Mr Mitchell said.

After taking into account the #5bn debt write-off and #1.6bn cash injection which was necessary to make the authorities acceptable to investors, there will be a #1.3bn shortfall on receipts. 
This is before taking into account expenses which are likely to be well in <tag>excess</> of #100m.   

700160
The reviews could extend to certain senior managers. 
No indication has been given of the size of the pay rises, but they could be in <tag>excess</> of 100 per cent.   

700161
Our marine insurance covers such damage or loss after the first #320. 
To cover costs for the first #320 you may either pay us a non-refundable damage / loss excess waiver of #32 per yacht (#7 each for a Share a Yacht or Pot Luck), or lodge (direct with us, not through a travel agent) a security deposit of #320 per yacht (#70 each if sharing) at the time of making your final payment. 
Unless you tell us otherwise, we'll invoice you for the damage / loss <tag>excess</> waiver.   

700162
It had been a bewildering experience for them. 
Ian Jones, in particular, cleaned up in the line-out and, more generally, the Blacks won an <tag>excess</> of possession, but they played as if ill at ease with each other and intimidated by the atmosphere and setting of the Arms Park.   

700163
As expected, the city continued to celebrate Friday's joining of the EMS and fourteen per cent base rates. 
In early trading, the Footsie one hundred gained a massive a hundred and fifty points before being cut back by early profit taking, and renewed uncertainty from the Gulf. 
However, the volume of shares traded was in <tag>excess</> of one billion; the Chancellor's announcement being the panacea the city was looking for. 

700165
They had engaged three managers for this position in as many years. 
The managing director estimated that it had cost the company in <tag>excess</> of #40,000 during this period.   

700166
Regrettably, Oliver Gillie's excellent report, `Foreign maids trapped in `slave trade" ' (12 December) contains no surprises for those actively seeking to eradicate slavery today. 
Domestic slavery can be concealed easily, and when <tag>excesses</> do come to light they only too frequently have involved torture, sometimes with fatal consequences.   

700167
The men's and women's race winners drive away in Mercedes 190s and the tax they pay on their day's earnings will run to a five-figure sum.

Professors at the Central Committee's Marxist-Leninist Institute said they wanted an investigation that would delve beyond the recent past to examine Stalinist <tag>excesses</> against German exiles in the Soviet Union and Stalinist crimes in East Germany.   

700171
The change of ownership at Ansbacher is the latest in a series of merchant banking sales which started with the acquisition of Guinness Mahon, now in Japanese hands, and included the #950 million sale of Morgan Grenfell to Deutsche Bank. 
The merchant banking arm of British &and. Commonwealth is also on the market following the #1.3 billion collapse of the financial services group. 
Commenting on the sale, Pargesa said: `Ansbacher is today a strongly capitalised, profitable, well managed organisation with capital and cash resources well in <tag>excess</> of its current, and reasonably anticipated, requirements."   

700172
THE Government has set Oxford City Council an impossible Poll Tax target, claimed leading Labour councillors.

The issue has been referred to the tribunal by the white-collar rail union, the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association. 
BR, which is forecast to report record profits in <tag>excess</> of #300 million today, is likely to argue at the tribunal that investment would be restricted if it pumped surplus funds into increasing its pay offer to rail staff.

Wiltshire skipper Brian White had declared at 4pm on 258-5, Kevin Foyle top-scoring with a fine unbeaten 78 after opening batsman Paul Bail had scored his second half-century of the match. 
In the game's first three innings runs had all been scored at barely three an over, so Oxfordshire's target for victory &dash. a rate in <tag>excess</> of five an over &dash.  was a mountain to climb.   

700179
But since 1985 that trend has been reversed. 
Some 1980s <tag>excesses</> (notably the thrift debacle) were, not always fairly, blamed on lax regulation.   

700180
And for once this year, Littlewoods' results will be most keenly awaited not just by its rivals but by the financial community at large. 
The 32 members of the Moores family who still own 100% of Littlewoods, have let it be known that the sale has begun; the biggest part of the Littlewoods Organisation &dash. mail order catalogues &dash. is on the market, with a reputed price tag in <tag>excess</> (probably well in excess) of #350 million.

Olives, salami, taramasalata.

Russia's history can be read as a long battle with geography and climate. 
General Winter may have repelled invaders from Napoleon to Hitler, but he is a domestic tyrant from whom successive regimes have sought to escape by pushing south to more friendly climes and warm-water ports. 
Summer has never been a sufficient compensation for his <tag>excesses</>.   

700184
This began a burst of 29 points in 25 minutes which would have been more impressive if it had lasted longer. 
Derek White's 15-yard charge after picking up at a scrum was unimpeded by inconveniences like tackling, Stanger added another two, and finally David Sole scored his first international try from a tap-penalty move. 
The Scots oozed an <tag>excess</> of satisfaction afterwards at another job well done to go with their comfortable defeat of Fiji six weeks earlier.   

700185
The first is the obvious one of accuracy when estimating. 
If your actual intake is in <tag>excess</> of your estimate, that would account for the plateau effect that you are experiencing.   

700187
However, officially-endorsed secondary action would fall foul of trade union law. 
Consequently, the TGWU was swift to dissociate itself from calls for flying pickets to hamper the entry of trade through other ports. 
The fear is that the union's assets, in <tag>excess</> of #70 million, would be at threat from sequestration if it were to condone such action. 

700189
CHANGES in social security rules to ease the problems of the homeless will be announced today by Chris Patten, the Secretary of State for the Environment.

Among the last were 1,560 jury trials, constituting 2 per cent of total dispositions.

700193
The Court of Appeal made clear in its judgment on the Private Eye case that this would require a sea-change in judicial and legislative thinking. 
Others believe that <tag>excesses</> of jury generosity would subside if only the Press would put its house in order. 

700194
Anglo will start disposing of the property assets in the new year, when it will also sell Coalite's oil exploration business. 
Later this month it will announce the sale of five Coalite companies &dash. the quarries side, the builders' merchants, the waste disposal operation, the instruments division and Pozament, the chemicals concern. 
Total realisations from these disposals should be in <tag>excess</> of #70m, with the largest amount likely to be the waste operation.   

700195
But the Mulsanne's successor, the Turbo R, was faster still. 
Moreover, it had acquired the suspension and tyres to cope with the jumbo output generated by its turbocharged 6.7-litre V8 &dash. in <tag>excess</> of 320bhp and 400lb ft of tree-toppling torque.

`But this house is in large grounds, and there are plenty of windows all round." 
Mr Tom Lester described the application as `vastly in <tag>excess</> of what is necessary," while Mrs Jan Morgan said she would support a smaller area.   

700203
It will never be easy, as I have suggested, to estimate his own contribution to this, and his memoirs, voluminous though they are, do not illumine us much; judging by them one might conclude that he was, after all, something of a routine figure. 
But one can also see that he was a decent, honourable man, who efficiently carried out his government's policy, and who may even have tried to moderate its <tag>excesses</>.

Responding to a new threat to legislate against tabloid <tag>excesses</>, the Press Council appoints a trouble-shooting task force (above) to deal summarily with complaints.

She wore old and rather shapeless clothes and her curling purple-dark hair was carelessly knotted or else tumbling down her back. 
She seemed consumed by a wish to efface herself, to make herself very small and unheeded, while being as busy and ubiquitous as possible. 
She seemed to Michael at this time a rather strange young person, unbalanced perhaps and given to <tag>excesses</>, though as in the case of her brother he soon forgot that he had ever thought this about her.

Lonely, John Gower stumbled back indoors. 
He had drunk and eaten to <tag>excess</>, he wanted sleep urgently.

But the problems associated with a deficit of erotic playback are simply not discussed.

Mr Hoare, 54, who is married with two grown-up children, took legal advice after receiving a notice from the Vale of White Horse District Council warning him that unless they received the #15, he would be taken to court for non-payment. 
`My solicitor says that as the car park was officially closed, all I was doing was trespassing on council property, same as the gipsies who were there, and therefore there could be no <tag>excess</> charge owed", he said yesterday.

He is also a keen follower of the gee-gees and should be worth his weight in gold come Derby day. 
CIRCUS Circus, the Las Vegas-based gambling empire which embodies the worst <tag>excesses</> of the desert city, is at it again.   

700212
THE RESIGNATION of Nigel Lawson and Alan Walters was the lead story in all the French quality papers yesterday. 
Le Monde ran with its front page article a cartoon showing Mr Lawson and Sir Alan parachuting from a plane bearing a pounds insignia on its tail as Margaret Thatcher, struggling to reverse a nosedive, shouts: `I said we're going up". 
Alongside the cartoon, an editorial, headlined `The beginning of the end", said `the Iron Lady" was increasingly isolated by her `<tag>excess</> of authoritarianism".   

700214
Richard was more complex. 
He was clever, but disinclined to distinguish himself in study, athletic but lazy, honest but argumentative. 
His bubbling forwardness could collapse in an <tag>excess</> of emotionality.

Seeing a great performer dancing true to her native style is part of Altynai Asylnuratova's astonishing impact in La Bayadere. 
Although the Royal Ballet has acquired a certain Russian expansiveness for this production, Kirov-trained Asylnuratova simply recasts the ballet with the fierce lucidity of her movement. 
The plot's dramatic <tag>excesses</>, which can be comically absurd, take on a brief reality as she dances.  

700216
Throughout India there were countless hundreds of smaller stations where simple functionalism reflected a predominantly `native" passenger business. 
A covered platform to keep off the worst <tag>excesses</> of the monsoon rain, a ticket office, and a large, bare waiting-room or shed with a stand-pipe outside were all that were provided.

A TINY Scottish island is on sale for less than the price of a London semi. 
A successful offer `in <tag>excess</> of" #80,000 will secure an island of 28 acres set in fish-rich seas.

Though all the questions have been raised &dash. was it needless death?

It disclosed that BAe had obtained sites worth #514.4 million and inherited shares in nine associated companies worth #100.6 million, and that the Rover Group had more than doubled its forecast profits to #65 million. 
The next day, however, a confidential memorandum sent to MPs, and obtained by the Guardian, revealed additional secret deals which had been worth #38 million to Rover, and confidential profit forecasts, known at the time of sale, far in <tag>excess</> of public figures and rising to #142 million a year by 1992.   

700221
I hope that one of the many lessons to be learned from the case of the Guildford Four is that investigation by an independent force is essential to the uncovering of miscarriages of justice; that is, of course, if we want such miscarriages to be uncovered. 
There are many ways in which Americans are plethoric (`a morbid condition characterised by &ellip. an unhealthy repletion or <tag>excess</>").

At a now famous meeting last October, the strains broke surface. 
He assailed a group of editors for their alleged <tag>excesses</>: `Read our papers and you have the impression that the country is a lake of petrol, waiting for a match."   

700224
But, although Jacques claims that it is massively frustrating to watch Julie tripping round the flat half-naked and not be able to touch her, Mr Moore fails to project the necessary dashed and deviant desire. 
Looking more like a bewildered Old English sheepdog than a thwarted child-molester, he throws himself around the place, lying on his back and waggling his feet in the air, as if by an <tag>excess</> of physical effort he could make up for the thinness of the script.   

700225
Yet McNulty, who now lives among the professional golfing colony in the Ascot area, had cause to be grateful to a change in the weather. 
The reappearance of the sun dispersed the low cloud which had clung to the cliffs of the Mont Agel course and consigned the morning starters on the last day to rounds in <tag>excess</> of five hours.

Not to mention the Dobermanns.

Coal produced in <tag>excess</> of the government quota, according to one proposal, would be used to set up barter deals for consumer goods to raise living standards in the area.

That said, there are a few worthwhile bits. 
Mother Love Bone manage to talk quite movingly about the wasted death of Andrew Woods, Queensry&umlaut.che and Soundgarden make ten-second cameos about the Seattle scene, and Robert Plant and Aerosmith's Joe Perry prove that you don't have to act like a complete fuckwit when a camera's around. 
Metal might be infamous for its <tag>excesses</>, but there's no need to glorify them.   

700231
But because a slower economy means at least some slow-down in the growth of revenues, there are already indications that the Treasury is reviewing effective tax increases in the 1990 Budget. 
One option thought to be under review is the de-indexing of personal allowances. 
Yet even more dramatic measures may have to be sought because Nigel Lawson, the former Chancellor, has committed the Government to the introduction of independent taxation for married men and women &dash. an overhaul costing well in <tag>excess</> of #2bn in a single year. 

700232
CHARLES Bukowski drinks like other men breathe, all the time. 
In a 30-year career spanning many books and waterfalls of gin in seedy taverns and roominghouses he staked out as his private inferno, Bukowski slowly carved his name on the same literary bar as Henry Miller and Jack Kerouac. 
<tag>Excess</> is normal, normality is bullshit, and the only people you can really trust are brother and sister barflies though even they will shiv you in a dark alley the price of a Southern Comfort and 7-Up.

But David Hall, director of the Town and Country Planning Association, described the decision as an abdication of Mr Patten's responsibilities as the minister also responsible for housing and regional planning. 
`Without a regional programme of new settlements there will continue to be sprawl around old market towns and villages, a continuous free-for-all among the house builders, and an <tag>excess</> of appeals for the Secretary of State to consider."   

700240
Non-characters are depicted performing various acts, with little sense of their reality in time or space; and one might well argue against the absence of feeling for others and the seemingly unavoidable association of sexuality with violence. 
These led Bataille to call, with characteristic <tag>excess</>, for `an irrevocable ritual gesture &dash. the enactment of a voluntary human sacrifice".  

700242
Goldcrest knew from the beginning that it had a problem with the script of Revolution. 
An internal report presented to Lieberson in the summer of 1984 observed that the script had a strong documentary feel but very little dramatic potential. 
There was no opportunity for the audience to become involved in the characters or thrill to the resonant images; there was considerable room for visual <tag>excess</> that would divert attention from the narrative.   

700243
As editor of a magazine called Bostonia, I got an offer addressed to `Mr B Magazine". 
In all this world of <tag>excess</>, however, there is nothing to compare with junk mail, of which there are 62 billion pieces delivered annually: 250 for every man, woman and child.

The reorganization plan, filed in July 1985, provides for the creation of a permanent fund for the personal injury claimants, consisting of cash and insurance proceeds of $850m., a $1.65b., bond (which will provide $75m.

Ultraviolet light has long been accepted as a provocative factor for herpes of the face and lips and many people find that their annual attack coincides with their visit to Majorca or trip to the ski slopes. 
If herpetic infection is confined to the cervix, the only symptom is likely to be an <tag>excess</> of muco-purulent vaginal discharge.

Why should a `good" deficit not get even `better"? 
The first reason the Chancellor gives is that there is some `bad" froth on the `good" deficit: that is to say, evidence of excessive domestic demand. 
This argument starts from a different point on the balance of payments circle, with the <tag>excess</> of imports over exports.

When self-regard is so shatteringly undermined, the symbols of a former shaky greatness become almost an affront. 
So American railway companies turned on the stations which had impaired their financial health and destroyed many of them in an <tag>excess</> of architectural vandalism.   

700254
Or perhaps his patience with a Prime Minister whose adviser had publicly humiliated him ran out instead. 
For at least 18 months the Chancellor, whose heavy physique has been the butt of many jokes about the <tag>excesses</> of the rich under Thatcherism, had been making it clear he was not relying on good fortune to keep him in office.
