Maybe it was because everyone seemed to be against Mara Kaletsky that evening &dash. with the possible exception of the landscape gardener, Carol Hill, seen to be moved by Mara's vehement defence of Mrs Hyde &dash. that the young film-maker and artist decided to go ahead with her `project", despite the appalling climatic conditions, claiming afterwards that she had known all along what she would find out there in the gardens. 
The door leading from the passage to the flight of <tag>wooden</> steps outside had blown open in the wind; and this caused, as far as one can make out, a quite uncontrollable sensation of panic and hysteria among the women.   

700002
But here we were truly in a void; our footsteps had a booming, dull thud to them, and standing still with breath held left our ears desperately searching for something, anything, to catch hold of. 
My senses were confused by this new experience, having previously associated sightseeing with sights to see, not to mention hear and smell. 
To keep my mind in check I decided to remember the journey here (a cavernous train with <tag>wooden</> seats) or the flight to Riga (alarmingly, the roof leaked), but I couldn't help falling into the mental free-form that this placed allowed.   

700003
I was somewhat skeptical of the chance of reform. 
(In 1925 Mr Meighen, on Mackenzie King's vague pledge on the subject, said: `So that old bird is to be provided with <tag>wooden</> wings and told to fly again!") 

700004
This was the humidity that made the jungle, through which we were to ride for the next month, so luxuriant. 
The main highway was pitted with pot-holes and scattered with boulders and <tag>wooden</> bridges built for buffalo carts now have to take the heavy-goods traffic. 

700005
Flemish and Spanish doors, slabs of different coloured marble, stone surfaces, panelling, good mahogany, were all snapped up for background effect. 
`And we learnt all the paint effects to produce any sort of <tag>wooden</> finish or marbling."   

700006
Ah yes, drags. 
They were drags, that's right, and they were heavy. 
And the horse it came up with this long <tag>wooden</> handle, I  don't know whether it was three or four, I can't  remember, but that was for some couchgrass.   

700007
The miller's day was dictated by the movements of the tides because his source of power would only be available for short periods of two or three hours at a time. 
Early waterwheels were made of wood, but as cast iron developed the miller made use of this new material for his machinery. 
<tag>Wooden</> wheels decay quickly with the cycle of immersion in and emergence from the water. 

700008
If the Healey was better appointed, it has perhaps dated more. 
A <tag>wooden</> dash, manual window winder and plenty of chrome trim look pretty quaint now, and there's no missing the period feel.   

700009
The Israelis had turned the Damiani soap factory into a municipal museum but you could still see the family's name in fading Arabic letters on the archway at one end of the building. 
The wind and rain on the little hill above Jaffa had ripped away at the paint but it was just possible to make out the words `David Damiani" to the left of the broken <tag>wooden</> gate.   

700010
Mrs Pat Mitchell, a parish councillor, is raising around #l0,000 to create a new adventure playground at one end of the playing fields at Launton Sports and Social Club. 
She organised the craft fair at the club on Sunday (March 25) and is pictured (left) with one of the exhibitors Mrs Dawn Chambers, of Chestnut Close, Bicester, who makes painted <tag>wooden</> door plates and numbers.   

700011
even a policeman or two". 
And that their `tennis clothes stood out like a bandaged nose". 
In another instance an image is composed of smells rather than visual elements: `Cabbagetown smelled of coal smoke, chemicals, horse manure, wet mattresses, old wallpaper and dirty snow &ellip. the smell of hot metal &ellip. of decay &ellip. old wet plaster and rotting <tag>wooden</> steps &ellip. ."   

700012
However, it was necessary to renew the roof covering of clay plain tiles with identical material. 
The policy adopted for the conversion involved exploiting to the full the high, undivided volume of the interior to create two storeys of living accommodation. 
This scheme was suggested by the need to remove the partially rotten <tag>wooden</> floor, thus deepening the space available for subdivision.  

700013
The legal action cost the parish council #346. 
Large logs are now placed at the entrance to the common as a temporary measure to prevent any other vehicles driving on to the common, which is crossed by a public right of way. 
The parish council has now decided to repair and refit the <tag>wooden</> gate after hearing that a metal gate would cost #580. 

700014
I was one of those who advanced early, going into grade C (third-year design) for the last problem of my second year; thus I did not actually have the experience of the examination. 
The first year began with an extraordinarily intense program in drawing: freehand drawing in the studio, a large barn-like <tag>wooden</> structure about three blocks from the school, between the dormitories and the medical school, and architectural drawing and mechanical drawing in a ground-floor drafting room of the School of Fine Arts building.   

700015
Sister Bernadette had conversations with people sitting outside their homes, and eventually found her way to a house occupied by two couples and their children. 
The news of the arrival at the hospital was greeted with joy and excitement. 
They were invited inside, seated on upturned <tag>wooden</> crates and given mint tea and fruit, while neighbours crowded into the tiny building to share the celebration and children were dispatched to borrow glasses. 

700016
The grain was ground between the faces of the stones which came to be grooved to give a better cutting action, and the ground meal was distributed to the outside edge of the stones for collection. 
This method of grinding grain had to await the human skill to fabricate tools from two materials because three <tag>wooden</> parts were essential to the rotary mill: the rynd which bridged the eye of the runner stone and enabled it to be hung on top of the wooden spindle, and the handle, used for turning the running stone. 

700017
The Blue Guide lists almost 20 museums, churches and galleries within a circular area about half a mile across. 
The contents of these buildings are no less spectacular than their exteriors. 
The St John's Hospital allows a glimpse of early health care, with mock-ups to show how the patients were housed in rows of <tag>wooden</> cots, and cared for by nuns and friars. 

700018
Earlier this year a group of travellers moved on to the common, which is a well known local beauty spot. 
A <tag>wooden</> gate which prevents vehicles driving on to the common was vandalised.   

700020
Five years ago the village, which has around 120 inhabitants, raised over #40,000 for repairs to St Mary's church, parts of which date from the 1180. 
Mrs Joy Timms, a member of the Five Parish Ringers which includes Chastleton, said restoring the bells, which date from 1696, would cost #28,000 and work on replacing the rotten <tag>wooden</> bell frame was due to start next January.   

700021
As the train in question is one of the last allowed out from Budapest to Vienna in 1956, Sandor's film has taken on an unexpected topicality. 
Cineastes and Eastern bloc watchers alike should make their way to the Barbican's Cinema Two at 3.00pm this Sunday, 5 November (Box office: 01 638 8891). 
JOINING the already substantial ranks of film directors who have chosen to do a little moonlighting in the world of theatre is Ermanno Olmi, best known in this country for his vision of a rural community in 1900s Lombardy, The Tree of <tag>Wooden</> Clogs (1978).   

700022
Often three different types of roof &dash. pyramid, hip, and gable &dash. were included together with a wide variety of dormers in the upper storey. 
Most of them had shingled awnings borne on prominent brackets projecting over their simple <tag>wooden</> platforms.   

700023
To complete your evening, why not adjourn to the oak-panelled luxury of the STUDY. 
Here you can browse through the book-lined shelves, catch up with the day's papers, or simply relax with an after-dinner liqueur by the roaring log fire. 
A pleasant stroll through gently <tag>wooden</> slopes brings you to a small clearing of luxury homes &ellip  

700024
Rhubarb with either mint or lemon balm makes a tart, savoury jelly to serve with lamb. 
Put 450g/1lb rhubarb in a pan with a little water and cook slowly until soft and pulpy. 
Break up the chunks with a <tag>wooden</> spoon as it cooks, then strain the pulp through a jelly bag. 

700025
I used to commute regularly across the Bay Bridge between San Francisco and Berkeley, where I was a student. 
Now I tried to picture those beautiful old <tag>wooden</> houses, crowding close to one another along the crazily steep hills thrown up by some earlier geological trauma.   

700026
LUANDA &dash. A small crowd rocks with laughter as a uniformed soldier, his eyes nearly closed in a drunken Saturday afternoon stupor, writhes body to body in a snake-like dance with a plump young woman in a tight blue dress. 
Smoke from a row of barbecues mixes with the dust of perhaps 15,000 people shuffling along the <tag>wooden</> stalls to shop for meat, antibiotics, the latest fashions, even, it is said, used cars. 

700027
APPROX 14ft 8ins &times. 11ft 7ins max Velux window, eaves storage, built-in single wardrobes, power points. 
Rear window, part tiled walls, panelled bath, shower cubicle, vanitory unit, low level WC, radiator, stripped <tag>wooden</> floor.

On a stretcher in the centre of the vehicle lay a boy of about twelve. 
His legs were taped with bandages to makeshift <tag>wooden</> splints. 

700029
On a journey across the Trans-Siberian in 1977, Eric Newby found many of the old stations still surviving. 
Near Sverdlovsk (formerly Ekaterinburg) he saw an extravagantly castellated little <tag>wooden</> station in the woods.   

700030
Avoid non-browed condiments, which are diluted acetic acid coloured with caramel and without the rounded acidity of a true vinegar. 
Very popular in the USA, this vinegar is produced by the acetification of grape must (new wine not properly fermented for drinking), which is concentrated and then aged in <tag>wooden</> barrels.   

700031
Mercifully, Ishimure leaves to our imagination most of the physical horrors. 
The little details she slips in become almost unbearable: a teenage boy who weighs no more than a <tag>wooden</> Buddha; a fisherwoman raging at the routine indignities of being in a hospital bed.   

700032
The impact of tourism stops pretty soon outside the medieval walls of the town, and the dwellings are like those of any impoverished fishing village in Cornwall, Sicily or Provence: low, simple buildings containing no more than the most primitive necessities, but opening on to the turquoise bay, with the Venetian walls on the western side and red cliffs to the east. 
Walk on round to those cliffs and you come to what seem like utterly derelict sheds hanging on the edge of the precipice, stinking of goat: these are stacked with piles of skins for tanning, which goes on below in Brobdingnagian <tag>wooden</> barrels and enormous concrete troughs.   

700033
Daniel listened, head on one side, tongue slowly coming out. 
Before the song had finished he pushed over the pile of <tag>wooden</> bricks, violently.   

700034
Negotiations are continuing over a Hindu's application to use an outhouse at his North Oxfordshire home as a family temple. 
again decided to defer the retrospective application by Mr Sandra Kumar Vadivale to regularise the use of a <tag>wooden</> shed to the rear of The Old Rectory, Middleton Stoney, as a family temple.   

700035
Opposite the front door a notice warns `No food, alcohol or cameras." 
Inside is a long, uncarpeted prison-like corridor with bedrooms on either side of it, a television lounge which is furnished in the drabbest possible manner and a recreation room which contains nothing but a few <tag>wooden</> chairs and tables.  

700036
As he skirted the room to avoid the dogs, Rosie leaped against her chain and Lady hauled herself to her feet to join in the excitement. 
The outside door opened and a man entered the house just as Frankie slipped through the other door into the dark corridor beyond. 
He had taken only a few hasty steps when he heard the tread of feet on the <tag>wooden</> steps above his head.   

700037
The clubface effortlessly squares up to the ball-to-target line for a straight ball flight. 
The clubhead returns to brush the ground, therefore striking the back of the ball solidly. 
Lastly, the quality strike and good downswing sequence combine to create maximum distance, which is most clearly seen in the <tag>wooden</> club shots.   

700038
In a heavy-bottomed pan put the onion, pancetta or bacon, oil and 1 1/2 oz of the butter. 
Cook at medium high, stirring frequently, until the onion becomes light gold coloured. 
Add the shredded cabbage and a little salt, turn with a <tag>wooden</> spoon two or three times, cover the pan and lower the heat to medium. 

700039
As it drew closer to six the minutes seemed to race. 
The hearse was coming, turning at the <tag>wooden</> gate.

`Some people just cannot bear to come in second," he said loudly enough to be heard before getting into the car, reversing it round and driving away. 
Moran stood holding the edge of the door until the headlights disappeared and he closed the door without shutting the iron gate at the road or the small <tag>wooden</> gate leaning against the boxwood.   

700041
Instead, Mr Gorbachev sat on a red armchair and read what seemed to be an undigested version of his House of Europe speeches, in which he claimed that the inspiration for the Atlantic to the Urals message was invented by Charles de Gaulle. 
There was not a stir on the hard <tag>wooden</> benches on which the assembled company listened to the instantaneous translation, even though they had been kept waiting for an hour. 

700042
Observation of the range of products being made in the late 1980s by Nairobi's jua kali artisans &dash. those who work under the `hot sun" &dash. confirm that Mutang'ang'i's story is far from unique. 
Product differentiation and improvement has been occurring steadily over the years and now includes metal and <tag>wooden</> window frames, doors, storage tanks, household furniture, beds, as well as a much improved range of braziers, and tin trunks. 

700043
On the leeward side an elderly gardener was watering a smooth sweep of green lawn edged with a row of topiary conifers. 
Paths of the same simple, earth-red tiles used for the terrace led to the swimming pool and the white <tag>wooden</> staircase down the cliffside to the sea.   

700044
He was sitting in the middle between Toby and Catherine, his arms spread out along the back of the seat so that he embraced the boy and his sister. 
As in a dream Michael went to the big <tag>wooden</> gates and dragged them open. 

700045
His possessions had been sparse. 
A table with an old typewriter on it, three ill-matched <tag>wooden</> chairs (one overturned in the centre of the room), a sofa and bookshelves, and that was all.   

700046
Square-plan kilns were not used in the South until shortly before World War I. 
The kilns had brick walls; inside, at ground level, there was an open brick box to contain the fire, the draught being controlled by the entrance door. 
The drying floor was sited about 3m (10ft) above the furnace and was of slatted <tag>wooden</> construction, being made of laths or battens set fairly close together.   

700047
We had pine long before it was fashionable, and we painted it brown. 
But in the main the kitchen was tiled, like the Home and Colonial or a toilet. 
On the wall was a calendar from the makers of Biro flour, featuring a sallow girl, in sepia and a chef's hat, about to do something with a <tag>wooden</> spoon.   

700048
They were pale and unkempt. 
They wore T-shirts, and swapped jokes about the task in hand: banging <tag>wooden</> stakes into the ground to support steps they were carving in the soil.   

700049
But while Mr Dinkins has had death threats made against him for condemning the anti-Semitic black Muslim leader, Louis Farrakhan, his eloquent defence of Jewish issues appears to be counting for less and less in the ever tightening race. 
Until this week Mr Dinkins was considered a certainty with a 19-point lead over his opponent at the polls and it seemed that by early next year the first black mayor in the history of New York would be inaugurated. 
All that was before Roger Ailes, the media consultant credited with putting George Bush in the White House, got down to work improving the rather <tag>wooden</> image of Mr Giuliani.   

700050
Such a track record suggests they are past masters of styling; in fact, their previous company was called Theme Holdings. 
Inside Cafe Rouge there is glowing <tag>wooden</> panelling, cane chairs in warm tones, French posters, and original pictures, and a collection of art deco and nouveau light fittings just motley enough to look as if they all arrived there by accident over the years.   

700051
The leaded lights excluded every gasp of Solent breeze. 
The interior doors were solid dark oak with <tag>wooden</> latches that owed much to the arts and crafts movement.   

700052
It would also catch grain bounding off the floor with the force of flail threshing. 
The second most characteristic external feature of many barns is the pitching hole, a window-like opening, covered by a <tag>wooden</> shutter, several of which might be provided in the side and end walls in order to pitch corn or hay into the barn from a cart standing outside.   

700053
Flush fitting sides mean you get the look of a built in cooker is so desired. 
So as you can see not only have we designed a gas cooker which looks impressive in the most modern of kitchens or traditional <tag>wooden</> cabinetry. 

700054
Most styles of furniture can be made up in any one of over 6000 different fabrics, giving the customer great freedom of choice. 
All of the upholstered furniture is built onto a durable wooden frame and, in keeping with environmental, guidelines, no CFCs are used in the production of the foam. 
The <tag>wooden</> furniture on show includes dining tables and chairs, display cabinets, sideboards and bookcases. 

700055
Constructed from wood on a circular base, this type of mill was usually eight-sided, although six-, ten- and twelve-sided mills were also built. 
In this type, only the cap of the mill and sails rotate to work the grinding stones, so the wooden walls are either sloped or battered to allow free movement of these elements. 
These mills, which sometimes have a tarred brickwork plinth with the <tag>wooden</> structure painted white, are more frequently converted into houses than the less enduring post mills. 

700056
Pretty front garden, mainly laid to lawn, with an interesting variety of flowers and shrubs, shared side access to 
Easily maintained paved patio garden, bounded on all sides by <tag>wooden</> fencing and with trees and shrubs, affording a high degree of privacy and seclusion.

The maki sushi was delicate and light, containing cooked peeled prawns, enhanced by wasabi &dash. green horseradish paste. 
Our main course choices were chicken kyoto and tempura. 
The chicken came in a tasty dry coating in bitesized pieces, ready to be dunked in its own dip with the short Japanese <tag>wooden</> chopsticks. 

700059
The style was reminiscent of that of Ceylon, where the Crown Agents had also had a hand in station-building. 
At Iddo Island a long wooden building with a central gable and flanking verandas dominated the station complex, while on the northern extension the stations were all squat rectangular stone structures with a round-arched loggia on all four sides and with the name of the station sculpted on an entablature rising from the middle. 
This was the style, not unlike that of the state of Hyderabad in India, at Jebba, Zaria, and Abo, while other towns had quite different multi-gabled <tag>wooden</> structures with long verandas.   

700060
The failure of the hands to unfold downward enough causes a succession of topped or thinly contacted shots. 
Finally, poor release dissipates clubhead speed because the downswing sequence is not correctly completed, resulting in short tee shots with the <tag>wooden</> clubs.   

700061
This particular store in Clapham's Abbeville Road used to be an ordinary branch of Thresher. 
It metamorphosed to Wine Rack after its conversion to wine merchant lookalike with bottle green colour, smart <tag>wooden</> shelves, wine casks and wicker baskets on the floor for added ambience, and bottles labelled by country of origin with tasting notes attached.   

700062
He lives at The Old Glebe, Tadmorton, Banbury, with his wife, Susan, and four-year-old daughter, Laura. 
Thieves prised a <tag>wooden</> frame from a garage door in order to steal a car at Bicester.

This way." 
Beeswax was the smell Margaret had always heard that convents smelled of. 
She saw that the <tag>wooden</> banisters and the stairs were brightly polished and felt that the rather musky fragrance in the air must be beeswax.   

700064
It was common for the storage building to be accompanied by a pair of kilns and a complete range of such structures might be erected adjacent to a very long storage building on a site where the cultivation of hops was undertaken intensively (eg, at the hop farm of a brewery.) 
This oast-house conversion is rather unusual in that four kilns or `roundels" are attached to the central storage shed, a pair being placed on both sides of this building, giving a symmetrical composition. 
The shed itself was largely of <tag>wooden</> construction, and as the photograph of its pre-conversion condition indicates (Plate 15), it was in a very ramshackle state. 

700065
The Morris dancers, walking gingerly two by two, had by now left the shore, and the little girls were following, looking very cold in their white satin dresses. 
The bell was moving very slowly indeed and had almost reached the middle of the causeway where the <tag>wooden</> section was set in, commemorating the brave nuns of the sixteenth century.   

700066
Despite the great romance and drama of the building of the East African `Uganda" railway, none of the stations was particularly grand. 
Only at Nairobi, where the station created the city, was there a handsome building with a deep, shady, <tag>wooden</> valance along the platform side and a fine tapering clock-tower in the middle. 

700067
But in the streets, opposition supporters celebrated victory, as the party's early and unofficial returns showed their candidate leading by a wide margin. 
After the polls closed, on a day of uneventful balloting, the more spirited contest between opposing parties began. 
Election workers rushed <tag>wooden</> balloting boxes past rows of soldiers and police at electoral committee headquarters to be stored until the results are officially tabulated next Sunday. 

700068
He threw himself vigorously into the work in hand, and presented the aspect of one who did not know when to stop. 
Up to his last days, he regularly walked his dogs, and was on the point of doing so on his usual route from his home &dash. the oldest lived-in <tag>wooden</> house in London, built in 1483 &dash. when he had his fatal fall.   

700069
`I've never eaten them," Richard gazed up at the man, his clear chestnut eyes, starry with their thick lashes, open wide as he judged the amount of pathos necessary to achieve his aim. 
`Have ye not," the young man's voice was noncommittal as he straightened his back and wound up the spare netting on a <tag>wooden</> stake.   

700070
It too has eccentricities (a laboriously skew-whiff set to match the out-of-joint times; a Polonius who hides under Gertrude's bed rather than behind the arras just so that Hamlet can have the thrill of bloodying the incestuous sheets) and, like Lyubimov's production, it takes liberties with the text. 
But whereas in the Lyubimov version, the acting is largely coarse and the interplay between the characters generalised and <tag>wooden</>, the performances from Daniels' cast are, even when controversial, subtly thought-through and fleshed-out. 

700071
So one by one, the children &dash. girls as well as boys &dash. appeared in the yard, each dressed in little khaki uniforms. 
They formed up on three sides of the square, at the fourth side of which was a low <tag>wooden</> bar suspended a foot from the ground by two vertical metal supports. 

700072
It's real cosy, specially if he's got the fire on. 
He's got loads of interesting things like <tag>wooden</> masks and a big metal pipe for smoking and a little brass bell.

Seven humanly-worked spherical stones &dash. one of which was decorated &dash. and a stone chipped into the shape of rough pyramid have been found. 
The excavations &dash. directed by Ian Armit, of Edinburgh University, and funded by the National Museums of Scotland &dash. have also revealed parts of the timber uprights, wattle work internal walls, floors covered with straw and heather, hearths, box beds and stonewall footings. 
The stone slabs and post holes of the defended island perimeter, as well as traces of the <tag>wooden</> foundations of a 40-yard bridge to the mainland, have been unearthed.   

700074
`Show me." 
He pushed past Sharpe into the map room where he threw back the heavy <tag>wooden</> shutters to flood the tables with sunlight.  

700075
Now then!" shouted John Fitzsimmons, from the greengrocers, and looked embarrassed. 
But the little <tag>wooden</> balls went home, one, two, three, cans clattered down, to the surprise and applause of the crowd.   

700076
It is the little brother of Gilbert's Eros at Piccadilly Circus, and also made of aluminium. 
The winged figure, carrying a palm frond and a trumpet, is balanced by one delicate toe on an onyx sphere and mounted on a <tag>wooden</> pedestal (10 1/2 in in all).

Don't expect perfection in a second-hand boat, but distinguish between minor blemishes and major faults. 
In a <tag>wooden</> boat, look for rot or soft patches, especially in odd corners and around the waterline.

He may have meant that but that was before the Prime Minister and Mr Forsyth got to him." 
THE ADORERS of the Sacred Heart of Jesus of Montmartre played out their first Nuns' World Snooker Championship yesterday, overlooked by a <tag>wooden</> crucifix, a beige madonna and a host of press photographers, television cameramen and reporters.   

700079
Nearly 200 additional police and correction services officers were engaged in the operation at the Phoenix House detention centre, a closed camp on the Kowloon peninsula which holds about 60 boat people. 
Camp members earlier had hoisted <tag>wooden</> planks out of the windows painted with slogans against forced repatriation.   

700080
Dora saw now that the high wall, which had seemed to rise directly out of the lake, was in fact set back more than fifty yards from the edge of the water. 
From the lake shore there ran two roughly pebbled paths, one up to the great gateway, whose immense <tag>wooden</> door stood firmly shut, and the other away to the left alongside the Abbey wall. 

700081
When the University founded two graduate colleges (Linacre and St Cross) to alleviate the problem, van Heyningen became first Master of St Cross. 
Although the College was housed in temporary accommodation for its first 16 years, van Heyningen's Mastership ensured that there was a genuine sense of collegiate personality even in the <tag>wooden</> pavilion of its early days.   

700082
Two button-back Chesterfield-style settees &dash. ever-fresh classics are upholstered in a print with a cool, restrained palate. 
Windows are draped with matching curtains, simply suspended on plain <tag>wooden</> poles. 

700083
I had a couple of cadavers to tend, and I learned more about structure and the interrelationships of function and form than in any other way I can conceive. 
I also apprenticed myself to Jim House, who was working on a large <tag>wooden</> sculpture, and I worked with him on that through most of the year.   

700084
The day ended with a gentler visit, by car, to Crarae Gardens, some ten miles from Inveraray. 
Every <tag>wooden</> bridge, brook and waterfall seemed to have been borrowed from a musical.   

700085
Meanwhile, plant ivy at 2ft intervals along the chain link fence. 
It will gradually climb and cover the fence and make a handsome green backdrop for foreground planting. 
When the fence is fully covered, you can snip off any growths that start questing sideways towards the <tag>wooden</> poles. 

700086
I did buy them plastic swords and there were good reasons for that. 
One was that every chop stick in the house had disappeared, along with every ruler, every decent-sized <tag>wooden</> spoon, and most of my garden canes. 

700087
To slow down the galloping commode and prevent a nasty accident, and because I was alarmed at her vehemence, I agreed. 
I nodded vigorously, saying that bourgeois democracy was something I just couldn't stand, never could, as she well knew. 
The commode slowed, but she was silent now as if regretting the outburst, staring straight ahead at the Biro calendar, at the girl with the <tag>wooden</> spoon.   

700088
The Hanged Man was exactly what one would have expected, a typical English village pub. 
The floor was stone flagged, there was a log fire on an open hearth, iron-work tables which had seen years of use, high-backed <tag>wooden</> benches. 

700089
There can be few places featured in our brochure which are more lazy and laid back than Ortakent. 
One long sandy beach surrounds a huge calm bay with crystal clear green water near the shore changing to blue as the sky deepens. 
If you really want to be energetic, there's windsurfing and waterskiing here or you can stroll along the beach to where they still make <tag>wooden</> Turkish boats by hand.   

700090
If you are not careful, you can end up giving a rave review to the Polish spirit rather than a sceptical review to the piece itself. 
Propping up a <tag>wooden</> gate, their feet chattering like nervous or frozen teeth, a group of actors mimes a cattle truck bound for a concentration camp. 

700092
Very little work has been done in this country on the effects of  vegetation on channel capacity, and the roughness caused by trees has been the  least studied of all. 
One study in 1982 found that trailing tree branches accounted  for only 23 per cent of channel roughness, compared to <tag>wooden</> piling protecting  a bank, which increased the roughness by 50 per cent.

In Sheffield, until the 1930s, power from a waterwheel was even used to grind cutlery. 
When the mills of the North of England are referred to, we think immediately of the nineteenth-century factories which were built for the purpose of manufacturing yarn and textiles, rather than buildings containing corn-grinding machinery. 
The earliest textile mills were similar to the traditional water-powered flour mills because they consisted of load-bearing masonry external walls and <tag>wooden</> floors held up by timber posts or cast-iron columns and often occupied equally remote rural locations in order to exploit fully the power provided by the rushing streams of narrow Pennine valleys.

Neilson was involved in a six-week trial, charged with a series of murders culminating in the kidnap and killing of 16-year-old heiress, Lesley Whittle. 
The trial was the scene of frenzied media attention and public interest, and still bears a grim reminder of the proceedings &dash. a cut made in the <tag>wooden</> surround by Neilson to demonstrate a point to the judge.

700109
He has got to be very knowledgeable about toys in order to take in what children are asking him for. 
This year's Father Christmas cannot rely on last year's craze for My Little Pony: he has to understand that when a four-year-old mutters about little furry animals which live in little <tag>wooden</> houses, she is talking about the latest craze: Sylvanian Families.

Dr Malcolm Graham, Oxford's local history librarian, wrote a detailed account of The Building of Oxford Covered Market for Oxoniensia in 1979, and he describes what the early market was like: `From the south or High Street front, three avenues beneath the Parade led into the market. 
The forty butchers' shops, built in groups of ten and dissected by open avenues, stood immediately to the north. 
The shops, on Townsend's stone foundations, were of <tag>wooden</> construction with lath and plaster between the timber framing.

Later, a great step came when we started making films. 
We had to change the design of the orchestra's stage seating so that the cameras could get the proper angles on the players, and the new <tag>wooden</> structure made a great difference to the sound we were able to get in the hall.

Kamal Jumblatt lived &dash. and Walid still lives &dash. in a magnificent palace of dressed stone at Mukhtara, its courtyards alive with fountains and artificial waterfalls and green-uniformed gunmen. 
When his militiamen had stormed onto the Jiyeh coast road and killed the remaining Phalangist defenders there in 1985, I found Walid leaning back in an old <tag>wooden</> chair in one of his palace reception rooms, swigging from a bottle of frozen Czech lager and lamenting the moral improprieties of war.

To take up the language of freedom is very difficult."

700124
Apart from a pile of fading wreaths and evidence of recent digging, the grave of Ireland's most revered poet, spoken of today in the same bated breath as W. B. Yeats, is unmarked. 
The second grave is behind a roadside fence in the garden of the poet's pebble-dashed birth-place in Mucker a mile away. 
It has the <tag>wooden</> cross and deck of old stepping stones which, until six weeks ago, identified Kavanagh's final berth in Inniskeen.

The boy amid the ruins could have been no more than 12 years old and he looked at us with genuine disinterest, sitting on a broken office swivel chair in the middle of rue Trablos, scruffy brown hair on top of a tired, old face. 
He was wearing khaki dungarees about three sizes too big for him and a boy's shirt with pictures of Mickey Mouse printed across the front. 
In his right hand he held the barrel of a Kalashnikov rifle, its <tag>wooden</> butt resting on the roadway.

The style was reminiscent of that of Ceylon, where the Crown Agents had also had a hand in station-building. 
At Iddo Island a long <tag>wooden</> building with a central gable and flanking verandas dominated the station complex, while on the northern extension the stations were all squat rectangular stone structures with a round-arched loggia on all four sides and with the name of the station sculpted on an entablature rising from the middle. 

700128
Outside, on a corner of the building, is a statue of a San Pedro de Alcantara, the bronze toes of which worshippers kiss.

700136
`The H-bomb looms ahead," remarked the critic William Whitebait, `and we daren't look at it, we creep back to the lacerating comfort of `last time"". 
From the demonstrations of British pluck and enterprise in The <tag>Wooden</> Horse (1950), the first of a series of escape pictures, and the celebration of one woman's heroism in the Anna Neagle-starring Odette (1950), through action films such as The Dam Busters (1955), The Battle of the River Plate (1956, Pursuit of the Graf Spee in US) and Sink the Bismark (1960), there is a sense of well-known events being played out for an audience that already knew about them. 

700137
I reckon you'd be like one of them statues &dash. all hard and cold, sort of stuck in one shape. 
I try it for a bit &dash. you know, pretending that I'm all frozen, but someone on a bike comes down the path and I got to move to get out the way. 
There's a <tag>wooden</> bench by the side of the path, so I sit down and stretch my legs out.

The huge sequoia and hemlock trees have stood through centuries of earthquakes.

Leon Milburn shows off the front room of his prized 1911 <tag>wooden</> bungalow, built virtually astride the San Andreas fault. 

700139
Only occasionally was a churchless station built with its own elaboration. 
At Oyash, 50 miles north-east of Novosibirsk, a small <tag>wooden</> station with a distinctly Orientalist feel to its carved wooden decoration was dominated by a water tower, similarly decorated, which provided the upward thrust so common in Western stations in the nineteenth century and so lacking on the Trans-Siberian.

Several called upon God to destroy the city in which he had met his death. 
On the edge of Moawad's home town of Zghorta, a crowd of screaming women heaved the coffins from the ambulances, tore aside the flags that covered them and began kissing the <tag>wooden</> caskets beneath.

He left from a mean <tag>wooden</> structure at Parel, near Government House.   

700146
LET'S be quite clear on one thing: the problem at Chez Bernard, an 18-month-old restaurant in Crystal Palace, south London, is not the food. 
Chef-proprietor Bernard Petit can cook, as evidenced by a rough and robust salad of haricot beans, good bouillabaisse and delicate orange-filled crepes. 
Nor is it the decor, which is at least honest in its plainness, well-lit with <tag>wooden</> floorboards and two tidy lines of tables.   

700147
And Robina didn't like that at all. 
The inevitable subject of the local rapist having come up (the four women were sitting together, now, since Monica Purves's offer to open the side window at the rear end of the room, with its pitch black view of boarding and sodden shrub, had brought them all to the garden end of the room) it soon led on to the topic of women in general; and the change (if any) in society's attitude to physical violence and social discrimination against them. 
Monica Purves, still puffing on her cigar, put her legs in pinstriped trousers up on the brass fender (another of Tilda's polishing tasks) that guarded the fine old <tag>wooden</> fireplace at the garden end of the room. 

700148
AGAIN it is time for the annual flood of silly-sounding, brightly coloured plastic board games. 
But for people who appreciate craftsmanship and like a challenge, Maison has five <tag>wooden</> mini-games, delightfully packaged in small boxes easy to fit in a pocket and ideal to play when travelling, to entertain flu victims in bed or as stocking fillers.   

700149
Towards the centre of that area were roses and rhododendrons that had been left to grow like weeds, and a willow tree whose branches reached right to the ground to create a shady den around its trunk. 
Beyond the willow and the blackberry hedges was an untidy collection of huts and tin-roofed chicken-pens that Buddie had erected against the far wall. 
As always, the big <tag>wooden</> gate in the distance was locked.

It went some way to repairing their damaged pride after their defeat by Swindon Town at the weekend, Mickey Inotta was there; Mickey it must have cheered you up a bit. 
It did, what didn't cheer me up though Jane was the Press Box facilities. 
In the second division in this day and age, I had to climb a <tag>wooden</> ladder, I had to go all the way to the very top of the main stand and there was a shed, and at the end of the match, surface water forced me to dry my socks off in the radiator in the dressing rooms afterwards.

Nicholson especially won some excellent notices although Fonda reckoned that Dennis Hopper's performance had been the best of the three. 
Fonda himself once again suffered the attribution of the word `<tag>wooden</>".   

700158
One day somebody has the bright idea of pegging the logs in place so they will run along with the sledge. 
Then somebody else suggests that if they trim the bit off the log that goes under the sledge to form an axle, it won't be so hard to pull. 
Finally, it dawns that if they dispense with logs altogether and replace them with slim <tag>wooden</> sections or discs pinned to the sides of the sledge, the whole operation will become a great deal easier.

At Gran's house, a back-to-back in Easton with an outside toilet, you didn't go unless you really had to, especially in the winter. 
Their own house in those days, a step up the social ladder from Gran's, had its own indoor toilet, a dark narrow room off the half-landing that always niffed a bit, however much Sanilav and Dettol his mother poured into the bowl. 
He remembered vividly that yellowish ceramic bowl with the trademark `Challenger", the big varnished <tag>wooden</> seat that was always pleasantly warm to the bum, and a long chain dangling from the high cistern with a sponge-rubber ball, slightly perished, on the end of it.   

700166
It seemed to be a regular feature of visits this, a trip way out into the country to witness the stark frontier running blindly through the landscape. 
Not the Great Wall of China, but the Great Barbed Wire of Germany. 
A large observation post had been built for tourists, a wide <tag>wooden</> platform at the top of 20 steps from which you could stare into an East German village 200 yards away. 

700167
`The other half of the room," she said, `on the other side, is within the enclosure."

In four years he had become a walking encyclopaedia on all aspects of the `<tag>wooden</> walls".   

700169
As Michael walked back to the lake side he saw Toby running down the grassy slope from the house. 
He jumped into the boat, almost sinking it, propelled it across as fast as its sluggish weight would allow, and arrived breathless on the <tag>wooden</> landing-stage where Michael was now standing. 

700170
This happened in Santa Cruz during the Loma Prieta quake, where many adjoining buildings were of different heights. 
How buildings fare in an earthquake can depend on design and materials. 
<tag>Wooden</> frames are better able to flex and, in effect, have longer periods than stiffer, brick or stone constructions of the same height.   

700171
The leisure centre was closed for several months during the winter to allow sound-proofing of the sports hall and swimming pool to take place. 
The improvements, costing around #300,000, involved erecting scaffolding so workmen could put acoustic tiles under the <tag>wooden</> ceiling slats. 

700172
The court was told on Monday that Black and his brother Rudolfo set up the cocaine processing factory in Cranleigh and rented a warehouse near Heathrow Airport.

He and the Vice-Master, Alan Jones, created an instant Oxford Common Room with all the usual intellectual cross-fertilisation and rivalries. 
Perhaps the most innovative feature of this new college, furnished with elegance &dash. although, until its recent move to Pusey House, housed in a <tag>wooden</> hut &dash. was its direct connection to the University Computer.   

700176
Synthetic frames with a range of body widths and head sizes have enabled club players to enliven their matches, but there is genuine concern that power is being allowed to overwhelm skill. 
John McEnroe is among those who advocate a return to <tag>wooden</> rackets, which encouraged `touch" play without precluding aces. 

700177
They were sentenced to read the book. 
Perhaps compelling 12 people to read the book together while sitting round a table on hard <tag>wooden</> seats was the court's way of recognising the fact that Lady Chatterley's Lover is a book that can be read on compulsion and only on compulsion.   

700178
An example of such a conversion, in which the former windmill is only partly recognisable, has recently been completed at Ramsey, Cambridgeshire (Fig 54). 
However, it is only fair to add that, in this case, the surviving windmill structure was little more than a ruinous stone stump before conversion work began (Plate 41). 
Most owners of `recycled" windmills are also naturally disinclined to reinstate the <tag>wooden</> sail structures of their mills because of the considerable maintenance liability which is imposed by restoration of these complex and highly exposed features. 

700179
But within a month of its first public performance, John had another premiere, admittedly in the modest circumstances of an experimental matine&acute.e, presented by the Royal Academy of Dancing Production Club at the New Theatre on Sunday 15 June. 
For this, he used Debussy's piano suite, `Morceaux enfantins", as the inspiration of dances whimsically reflecting both memories and fantasies of childhood. 
The cast was drawn from the Sadler's Wells School, with Stella Claire as the heroine, a <tag>wooden</> doll, and Poole as a golliwog (complete with cakewalk, of course).

A continuation of the Tokyo conurbation, Kanagawa displays the same amazing urban landscape, a marriage of the massive and the minuscule, with giant office buildings flanking <tag>wooden</> tea houses, and of high-tech and low-tech, with electronic hoardings flashing and science-fiction lifts rising in transparent tubes half a mile from buildings without sewerage or drainage.
