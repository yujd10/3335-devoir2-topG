What I'm saying is that a believer like myself needs, has, and doesn't resent an element of unbelief, which enables him to understand what disbelief feels like. 
It's because, within the hearts of enormous numbers of people, there are all sorts of <tag>scraps</> of belief, and one doesn't want to say, `Oh, put it away.

The on-off collection of paper for recycling organised by Cholsey School Parent-Teacher Asdociation is on again.

A number of very relevant points were raised about the proximity of the school, the nature reserve and the recreation ground. 
These facilities represent a masterly piece of planning, since the scrapyard existed before any of them. 
Presumably the planners, like some nearby property owners, simply failed to notice the `mountains of <tag>scrap</>" referred to so often, when making their arrangements.

What impresses is a combination of wit and technical ingenuity that established him in the early 1980s as a frontiersman of what was then called `The New British Sculpture."

A recent enquirer wanted to know how you build an arch to span two existing wall sections without the whole lot collapsing.

Notice that there is no seismic zone  along the east coast of South America, the continental crust merely sits  passively on top of the mantle. 
The East Pacific (or Nazca) Plate, between the East Pacific Rise and the  west coast of South America, consists entirely of oceanic crust, but the  other plate consists of both continental crust (South America) and oceanic  crust (the bit of the South Atlantic Ocean floor between South America and  the Mid-Atlantic ridge).

A LATE rally by Cheetahs pulled off a fine victory in their Sunbrite League speedway clash at Saddlebow Road on Saturday. 
And once again it was dynamic Martin Dugard who was the star of the show with some brilliant speedway, none more so than the last heat victory that settled the issue for Oxford.

With proper management, Hatfield Chase and the neighbouring  and even larger Thorne Waste (currently threatened with destruction for peat  extraction, except for 200 acres bought at great public expense by the Nature  Conservancy Council) could also be the jewels in the crown of what is a  potentially exciting tourist area, already used for cycling holidays and badly in  need of an injection of capital, which the tourist industry would bring.

Since the introduction of A levels, English, Welsh, and Northern Irish schools, unlike schools in Scotland, Europe, or America, have expected pupils to study at most three examinable subjects in their years in the sixth form, these three being generally either all arts or all science subjects, though mathematics has been found commonly on either side of the divide.

I would out-page- and out-scroll-flip Accursius, who, hearing that a rival scholar, Odofred, was occupied with a redaction of the extant versions of the Code of Justinian that would overlap the huge Glossa Ordinaria on which he, Accursius, was at work, feigned illness, turned away his students, and in a cackling seclusion completed his massive task in `barbarous Latin"! 
I'd charge past Porson, who, raised in a remote cottage with only three or four books to consult, supplemented with random volumes of Chamber's Cyclopaedia washed ashore from a shipwreck, developed himself into an effortlessly erudite drunk, able to shoot off a four-hundred-page proslogium defending Gibbon's assertion that a certain verse in St. John's First Epistle was spurious, against the counterattack of an unsuspecting archdeacon!

Every morning Vic drives over the flattened site of his Gran's house and passes at chimney-pot level the one in which he himself grew up, where his widower father still stubbornly lives on in spite of all Vic's efforts to persuade him to move, like a sailor clinging to the rigging of a sinking ship &dash. buffeted, deafened and choked by the thundering torrent of traffic thirty yards from his bedroom window.

But I somehow contrived to lose my clubs, an early example of an absent-mindedness that has since cost me three overcoats, a scarf, several handsome walking-sticks, and about a score of umbrellas. 
These scattered <tag>scraps</> of memories of Oxford, and of some later events they recall, might have been ampler and more coherent if I had been able to check with the numerous letters I wrote home.

Pure art was abstract art: `Content," Greenberg wrote laconically, was `something to be avoided like the plague." 
Caro met Greenberg in 1959 and took the critic's advice &dash. `If you want to change your art, change your habits" &dash. immediately to heart. 
Having been a modeller of somewhat unprepossessing, lumpish nudes, Caro abandoned the traditional methods of the sculptor and became a welder and bolter and riveter of found <tag>scrap</>, sheet steel and girders and what-have-you.

But the four breathtakingly gifted singers and sound engineer of Electric Phoenix did just that at Abingdon School on Thursday. 
Most of the fun came in Cage's Solos for Voice, Dadaist collages in which <tag>scraps</> of popular song, seriously declaimed nonsense and a passionate drama consisting entirely of oohs and ahs are accompanied by determinedly silly events: one singer lets off a party popper as another puts on a toucan's beak, times himself carefully and takes it off.

They are involved in a county-wide scheme to save and collect as many aluminium cans as possible. 
Cans collected in the Witney area are taken to the Guide HQ in the High Street where the girls sort and store them They are sold to a <tag>scrap</> dealer in Oxford for a penny a can with the profits going towards the provision of a wet weather shelter at the county camping ground.

As luxury goods suddenly flood in, and incite the conspicuous display of the fat cats, the price of meat, vegetables, rents and spare parts soar for everyone else.

It is Vices impression that English wildlife is getting streetwise, moving from the country into the city where the living is easier &dash. where there are no traps, pesticides, hunters and sportsmen, but plenty of well-stocked garbage bins, and housewives like Marjorie, softhearted or softheaded enough to throw their <tag>scraps</> into the garden, creating animal soup-kitchens.

It was through the church that he rose to prominence when, in 1981, he led the formation of the Alliance of Black Reformed Christians in Southern Africa. 
The Alliance rejected racial and cultural interpretations of the word of God, accepted the religious involvement in politics, and put obedience to God above loyalty to the governmental authority.

The Satie fan knows none the less that the early piano pieces &dash. the Sarabandes, Gymnopedies and Gnossiennes &dash. eternally retain the solipsistic radiance with which they first sprang, totally unheralded, out of music history. 
The best of the later piano pieces somehow capture in their fugitive interweaving of melodic <tag>scraps</> and mechanical patterns a Haiku-like resonance far beyond their means.

The outer door was set into the lower corner of the left-hand wall. 
It opened on to a flagged walled yard that sloped steeply upward to where steps and a battered gate gave access to the rear driveway, with its ramshackle collection of goat- and poultry-pens.

Other minus points include being near a flyover, motorway, factory, sewage or gas works, pylons or <tag>scrap</> merchants.

Most of the increase was due to sales by central banks and communist-block (some ex-) governments; altogether they sold 521 tonnes of gold in 1989. 
But a fall in net disinvestment (ie, an increase in gold hoarding, and forward trading of gold) of 222 tonnes and a cutback in gold <tag>scrap</> of 24 tonnes cushioned the gold price.

To wit: there is nothing to worry about, stop moaning. 
However, I noted there are moves afoot to protect our huge numbers of unintentional offal-eaters, those who munch their way through meat products full of a charnel-house assortment of mechanically recovered <tag>scraps</> of spleen and colon, but would run a mile if Raymond Blanc turned up on their doorsteps proposing to cook his wonderful plate of pig oddments, the assiette aux saveurs de mon terroir, for them.

Some of these problems can at least be narrowed to a matter of probability or a choice of possibilities. 
The natural range of voices and length of breathing at least helps to focus the likely pitch or pacing of phrases; only plain chant seems to have been sung with more than one voice to a part and only the organ and chime bells are actually documented in church use at this time &dash. and so on. 
Yet the merest ambiguous <tag>scraps</> of evidence survive as to manner of performance.

There must, of course, be money-making enterprises as well to buy those necessities that cannot be grown on the farm, but these will be looked upon as secondary calls on the agricultural operations in which farm surpluses are sold to supplement the cash income from non-farming sources. 
Depending upon the size of your holding, you will keep one or two house cows or goats, turning their milk into butter, cheese, and yoghurt, and possibly a few beef cattle as money-spinners.

The Royal Society in Britain also set up a committee to investigate  the scientific aspects of the eruption and published a weighty tome  containing the committee's findings in 1888. 
These two reports remain the source of almost all the information about the  eruption; the Royal Society in particular went to great lengths to amass  every possible <tag>scrap</> of information and even inserted a notice in The Times  requesting anyone who had seen or heard anything to come forward.

Take, for example, the famous sequence in Jason and The Argonauts (1963) in which his hero fights a terrible duel with a gang of skeletons. 
Lasting less than five minutes on screen, this <tag>scrap</> took four and a half months of painstaking work, using the `Dynamation" technique which Harryhausen invented.

Traditional drainage has accelerated this problem in  two ways: by promoting farming methods which require high levels of fertilizer,  and by stripping out the buffer of vegetation between the riverside and the fields. 
It is not uncommon for tractors to slide into a stream as they attempt to cultivate  every last <tag>scrap</> of land beside a watercourse.

Since joined by such groups as Granada and First Leisure, it now looks as if tenpin bowling centres are set for a new wave of popularity. 
But what is the sport's fascination?

Reilly's plan presumably involves holding the Kiwi forwards and moving the ball out to the wing, where the uncatchable Martin Offiah represents Britain's best chance of tries, though this has not happened so far. 
At Old Trafford Britain's forwards were knocked over and Offiah was fed <tag>scraps</>, at Elland Road the forwards found the route through the middle so profitable the wings were again neglected.   

700403
The fact that Schubert was reworking a model from his own lifetime while Brahms was recalling a source of over a century before, tells us something of the development of historical consciousness in the nineteenth century; Charles Rosen has suggested that Brahms made music `out of his openly expressed regret that he had been born too late." 
With the progressive rediscovery of the pre-Bach past on the one hand and the hardening of the cult of originality into a doctrine of modernism on the other, it had come to seem to many by the first half of our own century that the gap could be bridged neither by parody techniques nor the use of models, only exploited through the assembly of disparate stylistic fragments or pastiche at its most ironic. 
A parallel might indeed be drawn between Stravinsky's `cubist" conflation of Baroque and Classical <tag>scraps</> in his Piano Sonata of 1924 &dash. Prokofiev called it `Bach with pock-marks" &dash. and Picasso's aggressive variations on old masters of which Andrew Graham-Dixon says: `He coped with the breakdown of tradition by remaking the whole of art history in his own image".

Local people say the yard is a health hazard, an eyesore, and a noisy nuisance. 
Authorisation for the yard's owners to continue storing <tag>scrap</> metal on the southern half of the site ran out last year, but the company is now appealing against a decision by the city council not to extend permission. 

700409
The furniture here is brown, the counter traced again and again with the circle of the glasses, circles that loop into one another like the circles in the core of a tree. 
The loaves of bread that have been snapped up are devoured by housewives at home who lather them with jam or pickles or whatever, anything to give the morning a bit of zest, and soon it's time to put on the dinner and women hurry into their back gardens to cut a head or two of cabbage, then wash it to free it of clay and slugs and put it on to boil for the dinner, which is served midday, usually with bacon. 
Nice big greasy dinners for some, for others, <tag>scraps</>.

An MG body-making project would save many MGB's and provide the Trust with much-needed income. 
Bishop and his colleagues sorted out no less than 1,200 tons of old tooling left to rust at the back of various Austin-Rover premises &dash. 750 press dies for the MGB body alone, others for the GT body and the Midget, and virtually all the original jigs for the whole range.

So, being a nosey bugger, which I am, I went into David's room and looked around for some {typo bad="evedence",good="evidence"} of what actually might have happened that weekend because I was {typo bad="competely",good="completely"} stunned.

As the academic year drew to its end the bright fragments of his ideas fell for the first time into a pattern as if someone had placed them behind a kaleidoscope lens. 
He emerged from months of intensive of his country's past with a radiant, inspiring sense of what it was to be English. 
Generations had toiled under the vile climate of this tiny <tag>scrap</> of land to create a prosperous and well-ordered society in which each man considered himself to be a monarch.   

700426
There is a limit as to how many crossings one person can cope with, and the computer monitoring could dramatically increase the efficiency. 
The experiment also acts as a tough test for computer vision, because it has to cope with variable lighting and weather, and to decide whether a <tag>scrap</> of paper or rubbish on the track constititutes a serious obstruction.   

700427
One scar, on her arm, would never heal, he said. 
He said that other servants at the house were forced to scavenge for food among the garbage thrown out by the princesses, or to beg for <tag>scraps</> from shopkeepers, because the kitchens at the house were padlocked.   

700428
He was lucky. 
There were plenty of crumbs to be gathered from around the cheese and <tag>scraps</> of meat and tasty skin to be picked from the carcass of a cooked chicken.   

700431
Then he was ready to carry his stolen feast back to his room. 
As he re-entered the main kitchen the dogs leaped to their feet, sniffing the air. 
On one of his recent trips they had frightened him so much that he dropped his food and had to watch helplessly while they devoured every last <tag>scrap</> of it. 

700432
The rest may be light and movable. 
If you take over a farm with poor fences, you will probably feel obliged to stock it before your fencing programme is anywhere near complete. 
It may well be necessary to `botch up" repairs using hurdles, bedsteads, corrugated iron sheets, <tag>scraps</> of wire netting, and baler twine. 

700434
Increased opportunities for European travel have produced a subtle re-ordering of England's traditional terrace hierarchies. 
The rise of the `casual" &dash. the smartly-dressed stand supporter with a penchant for calling cards, <tag>scrap</> books and well-organised mega-violence spiced with more than a hint of racist overtones &dash. seems a perfect symbol for the times. 

700436
Not the right note. 
Not the way to treat an audience who must have picked up intriguing <tag>scraps</> at least about someone's kitchen floor and the police and Dobermann pinschers.   

700437
What are the links between such informals and modern industry &dash. not only in Kenya but elsewhere in Africa? 
First, many of the materials with which they work, such as <tag>scrap</> metal, textile waste, and timber, are recycled, often illicitly, from large scale industry.   

700440
Many a time he was excluded for boring, a term never used these days. 
`I could never stand any rider being in front of me, if there wasn't a gap to go through, I made one." he added. 
He also recalled the experiences with his team mate Eric Irons, whose equipment was so bad it looked as if it had come off the <tag>scrap</> heap.
