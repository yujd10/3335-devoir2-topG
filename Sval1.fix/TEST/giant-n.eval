The other six chapters discuss the social and personal fall-out from Silicon Valley's recycled American Dreams. 
By 1987, US chip manufacturers had only one-third of their fabrication facilities in the Valley; the rest had followed lower rents and wages into the Third World. 
Having made these moves for profit's sake, the industry's <tag>giants</> then began a scare campaign, claiming that the US had lost its commanding position in electronics and that national security was at stake.

In 1808 the elder Burn sent William, at the age of 17, to the office of Sir Robert Smirke, then only three years in the business and already being offered more business than he could safely undertake. 
There Burn worked on the drawings of Lowther Castle and was entrusted with the task of supervising the building of Covent Garden Theatre, an arduous nine-month feat of office and site organisation in which he was hard put to maintain a working relationship between his 27-year-old employer and the contractor, Alexander Copeland, one of the <tag>giants</> of the London building world.

Dave Henderson got on base with a walk, and scored the A's first run via singles from Terry Steinbach and Tony Phillips.

COPIOUS helpings of greens were available but Nescafe was off the menu on Wednesday at the first Caroline Walker awards ceremony, in memory of the campaigning nutritionist who died aged 38 last year. 
The guests, who consisted mostly of green types and sensible eaters, were lectured by Jonathon Porritt, director of Friends of the Earth and very important Green Party spokesman, on his concern for the ill effects of Western food on the health of Europeans, and for the devasting results of exporting processed food to developing countries.

After Sunday's 5-1 defeat, the Giants may have a fading cause, but there are a couple of factors that may swing the balance of power a little towards them in windswept Candlestick tonight. 
National League rules apply for the next three games, and that means that Oakland must leave Dave Parker, their designated hitter &dash. who bats in place of the pitcher under American League rules &dash. on the bench.

BBS cannot often benefit from local fund-raising, and finds increasing difficulty in raising funds nationally in competition with the big league charities.

A flawless sergeant-major, the very model of a non-commissioned officer, entered the room. 
He had the instinctive grace and training to project awe at being admitted to the presence of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, yet he was also able to provide a sense of equality-through-utility as if rank were co-equal with function, that Chay might be the Army, but he and other non-coms made the Army possible.

They got this far with a strong defense and mirrors, but this did not suffice against the Los Angeles Rams, the only team to beat the 49ers, and now the second team to defeat the <tag>Giants</>.
