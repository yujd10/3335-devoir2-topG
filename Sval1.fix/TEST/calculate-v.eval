All prisoners seemed to be Hungarians, and all guards Romanian. 
A research fellow at the Open University, Dr Ormerod was astonished by the breathtaking cynicism of negotiations about what his freedom was worth: `I had the impression that once you were in prison any court case was really a question of working out how long you were going to stay there, rather than a means of determining your guilt or innocence." 
His ransom appeared to be <tag>calculated</> on the basis of a day rate of dollars 20 and an estimate of the probable sentence, with the cost of the investigation and prosecution thrown in.

What that means is that there's a whole new way of thinking about what sorts of tasks can people actually use computers to do so the offices of the future may well have no typewriters, but just micro computers tied into an information system, and that presents, I think, great problems for people. 
Yes, I think people think of computers as being devices that <tag>calculate</> things essentially.

Another is that of maintaining production stability, because, for example, a hold-up at one work station may stop the whole line. 
SAAB had estimated the costs and benefits of the line-out system and had <tag>calculated</> that the system would pay for itself within four years, with more than half of the savings coming from the increased production flexibility of the system and another 25 per cent coming from reduced labour turnover and absenteeism.

To understand why this should be, we need to look in some detail at the various components of housing costs. 
If we do, we will find an interesting message in the Autumn Statement numbers: either interest rates are officially expected to rise (rather unlikely); or the retail price index, as currently <tag>calculated</>, is giving misleading signals about inflation.

Although E. coli has enzymes which detect and repair such faults, a minority escape repair and produce true mutants. 
For the last 20 years researchers have been able to <tag>calculate</> genome sizes and mutation rates.

The IOR rule gives a benefit to larger mainsail areas versus adding sail area to the foretriangle. 
The rule used <tag>calculated</> sail area as one factor in determining a rating, which typically indicated a larger sail area on a masthead boat of similar rating, while the fractional rig actually had more sail area.

Again it is found that the ratio 2:1 is particularly significant to mankind. 
Beyond it the Pythagorean harmonic joins the Gods. 
Pythagorean harmonic triads are laborious to <tag>calculate</> and few develop into an integer series.

Enlightened home computer buffs could run off by design what the Old Masters had struggled for lifetimes to produce by conjecture. 
A few highly coherent mass-produced designs made fortunes, and there followed a spate of piracy and lawsuits over copyright. 
It was soon discovered that the monetary value of Pippaladean art, directly related to its coherence value, could also be <tag>calculated</> by computer.

It is impossible to prepare a site for building and development without coming across so-called Roman remains or old Elizabethan theatres. 
Some of them may well have been left by the Romans, but if all the relics described as Greek and Roman were really occupied by Greeks and Romans, then I have <tag>calculated</> that the population of the ancient world was larger than it is today.

The report's appendices showed that more than half of all graduates would be deferring or defaulting on their loans by 1995, he said. 
The department <tag>calculates</> that the average number of defaulters would be 41,600 by 1995 but insists this is out of a total of 1.15 million students and/or graduates covered by then.

When challenged by Mr Singh, Mr Maclean obliged the Janata Dal leader's enemies by suggesting that Ajeya Singh was a liar. 
Mr Maclean's reliability as a bank manager can be judged from his admission that he was not very good at mathematics, hence the mistakes in <tag>calculating</> interest on Mr Singh's alleged account.

There was no true analogy with a plaintiff having to give credit for supplementary benefit in a personal injuries case. 
As to the method of calculation of future loss, his Lordship adopted the multiplier/multiplicand approach rather that an actuarial approach. 
The approach for <tag>calculating</> the lost maintenance to the date of trial was to take one-third of the husband's gross income for the 10-year period, add what should have paid for normal maintenance payments, and then make a deduction of 10 per cent to take into account any delay in the making of variation applications.

While  some holes, especially near cities, are in great demand for fill, there has been a  reduction of available non-polluting fill material, especially pulverized fuel ash,  due to the scaling-down of coal-fired power-stations. 
In the case of open-cast  mining, it is generally difficult to <tag>calculate</> the exact balance of fill required until late in restoration, and this can lead to the costly importing of spoil.

However, the Institute of Fiscal Studies provided support yesterday for the Government's view that mortgage payments and the poll tax are distorting the inflation figures. 
Adopting an alternative method to <tag>calculate</> the Retail Prices Index &dash. using rents to calculate housing costs &dash. the IFS said the current rate of inflation was 6.4 per cent, compared to the official figure of 9.4 per cent.

Administrative support is inadequate, so that inspectors spend too much time on routine, low-level, clerical tasks. 
The commission <tag>calculates</> that all authorities will need at least 17 inspectors to cover the national curriculum as well as major areas of education such as primary, secondary and special needs.

A danger of a second confusion is bound up with the argument from the possibility of mistake which is implicit in the chain of thought we are examining. 
Mistakes are always possible, as much when one is <tag>calculating</> the risk of a drought, or of future demand for steel, as in determining the requirements of freedom of religion.

Since other groups in the health service have settled for 6.5 per cent, no reason is seen why the ambulance service should get more. 
The objection to the means by which the awards for the police and fire services are <tag>calculated</> is justified.

Because insufficient allowances were allocated, the union argues, the local education authorities used much of the money that should have been paid in incentive allowances to classroom teachers to pay the senior staff their incentive entitlements. 
The union estimates that local education authorities had to find an additional #7m, as well as awarding 8,400 fewer classroom teacher incentive allowances, to meet the cost of incentives for senior teachers. 
It <tag>calculates</> that the Government has underfunded the incentive allowances scheme by some #12m a year.

Practically all programs contain many loops, each of which consists of a series of instructions performed repetitively. 
For example, a financial analysis program might contain a loop to <tag>calculate</> the present value of a cash flow occurring in a future time period, which would be repeated once for each of, say, 36 monthly periods.

Once the 350,000 missing French soldiers have been represented by one, they have been forgotten under cover of remembrance, and physical atrocity has been covered by abstract nouns. 
Dellaplane <tag>calculates</> that the march past at the consecration of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, if it was accurately to represent the numbers of the dead, would have to last 11 days and nights.

All the more reason why the opportunity of the Uruguay Gatt round should be taken to get rid of it once and for all. 
Support for this view came yesterday from a Government-commissioned report by Professor Aubrey Silberston which argues eloquently that the effect on the UK economy of scrapping the MFA would not be nearly as bad as the textile industry sometimes makes out. 
Professor Silberston <tag>calculates</> that at worst it would cost 33,000 jobs.

Friendliness is in the eye of the beholder, to be sure, but the following features are common in languages regarded as friendly: 
Inclusion of high-level built-in functions &dash. language primitives &dash. designed to aid in performing tasks found frequently in the problem context for which the language is targeted, such as the calculation of net present value and days between calendar dates in a language designed for financial analysis  An easy to remember and familiar terminology, such as `NPV" to designate the function that <tag>calculates</> net present value  A familiar language syntax , such as the use of common algebraic notation in a language designed for scientific and engineering applications  Familiar user interface, as in a spreadsheet language that displays information in a tabular format common in many business contexts  Provision for easily linking the output of one part of a computation with other related parts, either by incorporating all parts within a single integrated package (e.g., spreadsheet calculations, data management, graphics, and text processing) or by employing a standard interface to facilitate the exchange of information among separate, more specialized languages  A consistent and intuitive language that presents few `surprises," allowing the user generally to predict what the language will do in a given situation, guided by a general understanding of its logic and syntax rather than a recollection of its detailed features  Intelligent default decisions on the part of the system so that

Mr Kinnock intervened to say the figures he and many others referred to were from a Commons select committee and demonstrated the difference between the Government's expenditure related to the general rate of inflation and the actual rate of cost increases for the NHS to meet the needs of the elderly and development costs. 
The difference is <tag>calculated</> by experts to be running at about #3bn.

Sorry about that, and you may have wondered why Elton came on last &dash. why he came on at all, indeed. 
He's an obligatory element in these affairs, it seems, and I put him on last as a favour to my friend Jonathan Powell, the brilliant young Controller of BBC 1. 
Powell <tag>calculated</> that if Elton came on at precisely 11.24 there would be a massive switchover to the BBC, allowing punters to catch Gore Vidal telling Sue Lawley that Mrs Thatcher had lost her marbles.

Aspiring to remain America's most favoured ally, Mrs Thatcher has to reckon with the Bush administration as the most pro-European in many years in the sense of supporting the further integration of the Community. 
After at first regarding 1992 and the subsequent Delors Plan for economic and monetary union with some suspicion, the US has <tag>calculated</> that the geo-political advantages of deeper integration outweigh whatever commercial disadvantages it may have for the United States.

It would mean a sizeable jump in the ratio of stocks to output in the economy to 95, its highest level since the end of 1986, reversing eight years of decline. 
If this ratio were to revert to its previous downward trend, Goldman Sachs <tag>calculates</>, the level of stocks would need to fall by #8bn in the next two years, a negative shock to GDP worth around #15bn or a hefty 4 per cent of national output.

Paradoxically, however, farmers in most EC member countries have been receiving far more for their produce than those of us in Britain. 
It is all to do with the horrendously complicated system of green currencies used to <tag>calculate</> the tax on UK farm exports and the subsidy on imports, known as monetary compensatory amounts.

That the United States" profligate public spending &dash. propelled by huge defence spending in Ronald Reagan's first term as president &dash. had to be curbed is indisputable. 
That matters have worsened considerably in the last 18 months &dash. as the full costs of the collapse of hundreds of Savings and Loans are <tag>calculated</> &dash. is clearcut, and played an important part in White House thinking.

Last week nearly 100 dockers in Aberdeen lost their jobs when their company ceased trading. 
The employers claimed the dispute was crumbling with 92 dockers returned as expected at Goole, Humberside, and another 22 went back in Hull, most of them at North Sea Ferries, leaving 28 of the 60 ex-scheme ports working to some degree. 
The employers <tag>calculated</> 5,228 former registered dockers were still on strike, 1,841 working normally, while 2,152 had taken redundancy of up to #35,000.

But the security forces have crushed all opposition. 
The alternatives seem to be a popular uprising, or a bid from within ruling circles for personal salvation through the overthrow of the present tyranny: only the reformists, it might be <tag>calculated</>, will escape either trial or lynch law.

Horse-racing, a sport that had largely remained in the hands of the aristocracy and which was the object of criticism from bourgeois ideologues and socialists alike, grew rapidly in popularity. 
Rationality, so dear to the reforming heart, ironically found its fullest expression in the picking of winners after careful perusal of `the sporting intelligence".

Designers of such a language thus face a difficult tradeoff between the generality of the language &dash. the range of problems for which it can effectively be used &dash. and the amount of knowledge that it can incorporate about the tasks for which it is intended. 
Financial analysis, for example, frequently calls for the calculation of the net present value (NPV) of a stream of cash inflows and outflows. 
Accordingly, for the computer to respond successfully to the task description, `<tag>Calculate</> the NPV of the interest receipts from the Series 1998 bond" (suitably stated in the syntax of the language), the translator program must know a number of things about NPV and the bond portfolio.

A parliamentary commission set up last year to examine the effect of the previous government's privatisation policy last week published its highly critical report, the main conclusion of which was that the dozen companies returned to the private sector between 1986 and 1988 had been sold off at a loss to the French state of between Fr8.3bn ( #860m) and Fr19.6bn. 
The loss is <tag>calculated</> by comparing the price at which shares in the newly privatised companies were offered against the share values three months later &dash. before the crash in October 1987 &dash. which in some cases had increased nearly 30 per cent.

The substantial issue concerned the value of the goods. 
It was common ground that the diamonds had decreased in value since their seizure. 
Mr Zollner submitted that was a relevant consideration which the commissioners should have taken into account in <tag>calculating</> the sum they would charge for restoration, yet they had not done so.

Congress was also on the verge of regaining Karnataka from the Janata Dal, and was storming to victory in Tamil Nadu. 
The Communists strengthened their grip on West Bengal, but were losing to Congress in Kerala.

During lunch, Mr Walesa again raised Solidarity's hope of a $10 billion aid package from the West, which Mr Bush chose to interpret as a request for funds from Western banks and private investors, rather than an appeal to the deficit-hit US federal budget. 
President Bush sidestepped the delicate question of aid, but managed to use the word `dreams" 12 times in a speech <tag>calculated</> to touch the heartstrings.

In 1937 they expected an attack continuing for sixty days, with casualties of 600,000 dead and 1,200,000 injured. 
The ministry of health, advised by these experts, <tag>calculated</> in 1939 that from one million to three million hospital beds would be needed immediately after the outbreak of war.

Therefore the court has no power to interfere with his decision. 
Local education authorities which have been capped are not inhibited by any statutory provision from reducing the budgets of schools to whose governors financial management has already been delegated for the current year.

It is advisable to check that your complaint comes within the Ombudsman's Terms of Reference, and that he is therefore able to adjudicate in your case. 
You should also bear in mind that it is only once you have reached the end of the road in trying to obtain satisfaction through the Bank's own complaints system that the Ombudsman will be able to formally consider your complaint.

The Government has been accused by Labour of orchestrating BR strategy at arm's length in its concern to hold down its informal public sector pay norm. 
Mrs Thatcher's emollient stance last night seemed <tag>calculated</> to distance the Government from the BR board if things went wrong, while hoping for a settlement in a dispute where public sentiment has not swung the Government's way.
