My mother cooked the bacon in the morning (it owed its seer-sucker shrivelment, I thought, to the fact that the meaty striations contracted less than the fatty part, or vice versa: the pinpricks of exploding fat on my forearms and face were part of the brave scientific pleasure of studying the way it changed shape), and she laid it out to cool on paper towels; my sister and I had already eaten our share, but four strips remained on the paper towel for my father long after the grease from the pan was poured into a reused medium-size peanut butter jar on the stove &dash. a peanut butter jar that had been run through the dishwasher enough times that the glue under its label had softened: if you unclamped the dishwasher's lid at the right moment (this was a red-hosed top-loading portable whose hermetic clamped seal was almost as perfect as the one on a brand-new jar of Skippy) and, in a cloud of lovely garbagey-smelling steam, removed the freshly dishwashed jar, you could sometimes slip the now paler and mushier label untorn off the glass like one of the water-mobilized decals that came with the plastic models of fighter planes. 
In this clean and label-less peanut butter jar my mother recorded the history of each week in grease: unequal strata, some cloudy, some clear, some yellowish, some with a black crumb of hamburger or a tiny miscellaneous chicken bone suspended in them, some with little sketchy depressions left by a shameless mouse whose even bolder descendants years later used to spend whole nights of debauch in the by this time built-in and front-loading dishwasher, climbing around those rubberized jungle gyms when we forgot to shut the door on the dirty dishes. 
It was obvious to me when I described them to Patty that these sandwiches were called graveyards because the strips of bacon suggested bodies <tag>buried</> in the Nilotic ooze of the peanut butter; but at the time I never speculated on the logic of their name, which, thanks to my father's ability to convey his enthusiasm about everything he ate or did or thought about, I learned early enough for it to seem as perfectly suited to its referent as broom or road or envelope; the exciting thing for me about calling it a graveyard was simply that it was one of the very few sandwiches that wasn't sterilely identified by its principal middle ingredient &dash. the Reuben, the croque-monsieur, and the club sandwich being some other examples of an elect order that borrowed its glamour from the bigger-than-life bar carnage of Bloody Marys and Hurricanes.
