Nothing about Huysmans's portrayal of Marthe's miserable existence is sexually titillating, however. 
The book reads like a kind of inventory of narrative elements <tag>derived</> from the prostitute's realist plot, strung together in rapid-fire order with little concern for psychological motivation or character development.   

700002
We have come full circle to a consideration of the intrinsic value of some collective goods. 
If collective goods such as membership in a society are intrinsically valuable, then it is to be expected that they provide the source both of personal goals and of obligations to others. 
The confrontational view of morality which pitches a person's own interests and goals as not only occasionally in conflict with his obligations to others but as <tag>deriving</> from independent and fundamentally different sources is essentially an individualistic conception. 

700003
Consider the following simplified case adapted from one by Sen: a gang of ten bashers plans to beat up Ali. 
Donna can warn him, but is aware that though his pain will be five time as great as the satisfaction each of them will <tag>derive</> from the attack, given that there are ten bashers and one victim their total satisfaction is greater than his pain.   

700004
Noting that the happiness of another person communicates itself to the company he is with, Hume explains that what has happened is that the idea we have of his feelings, an idea given to us by `external signs in the countenance and conversation", is enlivened and converted into an impression, into the emotion of happiness itself. 
What is the mechanism of this? 
From where is the extra liveliness <tag>derived</>?  

700005
Gassendi thus provides a notable example of the influence of the rediscovery in the sixteenth century of Sextus Empiricus" Outlines of Pyrrhonism, to which reference has already been made. 
The markedly sceptical attitude and arguments which run through his writings are <tag>derived</> from Sextus, and from others, such as Michel Montaigne and Pierre Charron, who were themselves influenced by Sextus.   

700006
Orphic Cubism originated in 1912 to exploit the emotional, musical qualities of colour. 
Cubism was used as a vehicle for the laws of simultaneous contrast of colour, <tag>derived</> from Chevreul via Gauguin, Van Gogh, the Symbolists and the Fauves, by Robert and Sonia Delaunay.

Rainforests give us life in other ways too. 
One in every four purchases from your local chemist contains compounds <tag>derived</> from rainforest species.   

700008
Taking autonomy as the concrete form of freedom (the next chapter will deal with political freedom and will include a further discussion of the relations between freedom and autonomy) the strength of the challenge is all too evident. 
Does not our analysis reinforce the view that freedom is not an independent separate ideal, that freedom consists in the pursuit of valuable forms of life, and that its value <tag>derives</> from the value of that pursuit?   

700009
Millions of readers throughout the world have been thrilled by this moment in C. S. Lewis's story The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and have gone on to read the six other stories which he wrote about that other world behind the wardrobe, the world of Narnia. 
The powerfulness of the stories <tag>derives</> in part from the immediacy of Lewis's rough-hewn style, but more, surely, from the fact that this image touches something so very deep in so many people.  

700010
In argument, discussion, punctuating conversation, and talk in what were until recently largely nonliterate societies, the sacred word was circulated and became part of the fabric of life, as it still continues to be. 
The power of oral culture, the integration or sacred formulas into everyday speech, constantly created and reinforced more general structures of authority in society: the power of the father, the seniority of age, the restrictions on the position of women, the weight of model, right behavior. 
This discourse of authority was shot through with religious reference, and for practical purposes it made Islamic any number of locally <tag>derived</> forms of acts and relations.  

700011
These were Lautrec's only paintings of the year with multiple figures, and they employ the compositional techniques of cropping and asymmetry to convey the sense of a visual field casually glimpsed by the spectator. 
He had recently used these devices of Degas in the ballet paintings and Mirliton panels and once again he complemented them with a caricatural quality <tag>derived</> from popular illustration. 

700012
Lewis hosted this committee on a number of occasions at Magdalene, Cambridge, and he and Eliot dined together sometimes with their wives. 
Both liturgically conservative, they would have been unlikely to have <tag>derived</> much pleasure from the knowledge of how radical liturgical change in their church was destined to be. 

700013
Moreover, modern legislation has made possible (within limits) the creation of an irrevocable power of attorney, so that even knowledge of the principal's death or insanity will not affect the validity of acts done under it. 
An agent must not, without his principal's knowledge and consent, receive any reward or commission from those with whom he deals on his principal's behalf, or <tag>derive</> any profit from transactions entered into on the principal's behalf beyond the remuneration agreed upon.   

700014
However it may be significant that a line of waltz comprises four bars of three beats with heavy emphasis upon beat numbers 1, 4, 7 and 10. 
Its graphic form may be better interpreted by the 12 sided regular duodecagon, <tag>derived</> from a rotating equilateral triangle.   

700015
There can be no Christian blueprint for the `final" form of society, since it is part of its perception of the human condition that all forms of society are provisional, reflecting human sinfulness, though not always to an equal degree. 
It does, however, have a missionary vision of what it means to be truly human, <tag>derived</> partly from rational reflection on human capacities and desires, but supremely from its conviction that we glimpse true humanity in the life, death and teaching of Jesus.   

700016
Lord, he knocked my props from under me unerringly; one shot to a pigeon." 
Evidently, she <tag>derived</> some emotional satisfaction from having the sheer illogicality of her letters exploded by the great man himself.

Jurisdiction of the Divisional Court An appeal lay from a disciplinary tribunal to the Visitors of the Inns of Court, normally comprised of three High Court judges. 
Mr Kentridge submitted that all disciplinary powers <tag>derived</> from the judges so that any complaint about the incorrect or improper exercise of the powers must go to the judges and not to the Divisional Court.   

700018
Clubs did not compete with one another to attract larger crowds by reducing their prices. 
Nor did they make any serious efforts to <tag>derive</> income from a huge fixed asset, which was used for only a few hours a week.

Rathmore could be the site of some such outrage, possibly the extermination of an entire tuath, or minor kingdom, for some reason unexorcised. 
There is more ancient evil about than we are willing to credit. 
A second plausible explanation, more recent, <tag>derives</> from the siting of the gallows which serviced the garrison at Charles Fort.

The other ministers,. for that matter, had little distinctively Conservative. 
Only Halifax had an historic title, and it <tag>derived</> from a nineteenth-century Whig.   

700022
`Ideas" have played a part in philosophy at least as far back as Plato, for whom they had a reality of their own quite apart from any relation they might have to our minds. 
For Locke, however, they are `whatsoever is the object of the understanding when a man thinks"; and his conception of them as essentially mind-dependent things is <tag>derived</> from Descartes.   

700023
Karl Marx, when famously making mock of history's endeavours to repeat itself, described how the players in successive revolutions apishly imitated their predecessors. 
Similarly, folk memories of 1929 <tag>derived</> from flickering Pathe News clips inspire styles of panic on today's trading floors.   

700024
The habit into which the banks had slipped, and which their fresh approach to the business was designed to cure, was quite simple: losing money. 
The largest fixed-rate offering ever witnessed in the Eurobond market, a dollars 1.5bn five-year deal announced on Friday for Italy, which used the new money-making formula, provides disturbing evidence however that excessive competition, born of over-capacity, could yet ruin the latest attempts at restoring profitability to the market. 
The new system for arranging Eurobond issues is <tag>derived</> from the way new issues have been done in the US for many years.   

700025
Such a move might be supported by the claim that my analysis is hanging by a thread. 
It requires that a right be justified by the service it does to the interest of the right-holder but it allows that the value placed on that interest may <tag>derive</> from its usefulness to others.   

700026
For in attempting to provide a normative justification for my rights I have to refer to the individual transactions by which I acquired the houses. 
Therefore my right in the street <tag>derives</> from my rights in the houses and not the other way round.   

700027
In establishing an annual operating budget, management must consider such factors as earnings per share, stability of earnings, market share, long-term programs aimed at product improvements or lower costs, and employee safety. 
These goals generally conflict, and it is rarely possible to establish a formal tradeoff among the goals (between profit and safety, say) to <tag>derive</> a single composite objective function.   

700028
In this case the delights and satisfactions we take in virtue will be a product of deliberation and judgement. 
Hume, therefore, begins by considering `a controversy started of late &ellip. concerning the general foundation of Morals; whether they be derived from Reason, or from Sentiment". 
According to some, the divisions we make between good and bad, virtue and vice, <tag>derive</> from `a chain of argument".   

700030
He held that generalist knowledge must take priority; and Scottish schools at the turn of the century were founded on this principle. 
For it was thought that the generalist could, whenever he wanted to, add a specialist dimension to his knowledge, but general concepts were less easy to <tag>derive</> from the specialist.

It is used by all Common Rooms as well as College staff and its welcoming atmosphere provides a long-needed focus for Magdalen's social life. 
Magdalen has suffered from a reputation for fragmentation and anonymity, <tag>deriving</> largely from it geographical size and its relatively large numbers: 550 students, 44 per cent postgraduate. 

700032
The word is kratos and (with kratein) is commonly used in the trilogy to denote authority, domestic or political. 
Indeed, to revert to the Watchman's speech, it is, in fact, from the verb kratei (10) that the audience <tag>derives</> its first impression of the queen.   

700033
Goldring thought that Pound had succeeded in reducing Yeats from master to disciple. 
Other visitors <tag>derived</> a contrary impression.   

700034
Though Gassendi followed Epicurus in taking sense-experience as the criterion, or measure, of truth, and that on which our judgements should be based, he combines this criterion with its traditional rival, reason. 
Though all our knowledge `is in the senses or <tag>derived</> from them", it is not always simply a matter of sensory information.   

700035
The mouth of Hell often features in the paintings &dash. as in the village churches of Wymington, Bedfordshire, and Great Harrowden, Northamptonshire. 
Some art historians believe the design <tag>derives</> from the mouth of the whale in the story of Jonah.   

700036
British and American capital and technical expertise were dominant almost everywhere, yet seemed anxious to flatter their hosts. 
But the stations do demonstrate that architectural influences flowed north and south through the Americas, bending styles <tag>derived</> from Europe to new ends.

We recall Freud's observation, mentioned earlier in connection with Olympia, that {deadGuys}. while mitigating its horror by replacing the dreaded absence by a plurality of presences. 
Like Nana, Syphilis &dash. who is also identified as `the Flower" &dash. becomes phallic through the power she <tag>derives</> from her violent mutilation.

Act Up produced a long list of potential new drugs and therapies which, it claimed, were not being investigated because companies were investing in drugs like AZT. 
And a patients' group from New York, called Project Inform, released preliminary data suggesting that `Compound Q", a substance <tag>derived</> from a Chinese cucumber, could be effective in helping patients already taking AZT.  

700039
Existing restraints upon anticipation were preserved, but even these were swept away by the Married Women (Restraint upon Anticipation) Act 1964. 
And, by the Married Women's Property Act 1964, any money <tag>derived</> by a wife from an allowance made by her husband for housekeeping purposes, or any property acquired out of it, is deemed, in the absence of any agreement between them to the contrary, to belong in equal shares to the husband and wife.   

700040
As a matter of practice, therefore, either party will usually submit written instructions, carefully drafted with a favourable slant, on which the judge may draw for his final formulation. 
In most jurisdictions, however, instructions are nowadays <tag>derived</> mainly from `patterns" drafted by semi-official sources, such as California's BAJI (Book of Approved Jury Instructions).   

700041
Clearly, the Hitler image, in this fundamentally important area, was again largely detached from reality. 
Though at the very beginning of his political `career", Hitler had emphasized the need for anti-Semitism <tag>derived</> from `reason", not pure `emotion", there were &dash. as is well known &dash. no measures in the `Jewish Question" which were too extreme for him, except on occasions where tactical considerations prevailed.

Meanwhile, the Home Secretary intends to provide for the confiscation of organisers' profits. 
The feeling against acid house parties <tag>derives</> from a mixture of officiousness and puritanism.

Fuel consumption inevitably suffers if this sparkling little engine's potential is exploited. 
One of the Rover's most praiseworthy features is its gearbox.

This book was written 30 years ago, however &dash. would he be so sanguine today? 
NOT NOT WHILE THE GIRO by James Kelman (Minerva #3.99) These pinched vignettes of life on the margins <tag>derive</> their strength from the vivid, earthy idioms of Kelman's Glasgow; it is language that raises his characters above their dismal circumstances.

Having stated the general duty of a doctor towards his terminally ill p it is necessary to examine how this general duty is made more speci applied in the myriad real-life situations which arise. 
Analytically, the is one of <tag>deriving</> more specific principles from more general ones.   

700046
In discussions about the military situation in the east, the SD noted, the question was constantly being raised about how an end to the war against Russia would be possible at all. 
There were complaints when Hitler's speech to the Party `old guard" in Munich on 8 November was not broadcast, for it was said that in the disappointment about the unfulfilled expectations from the Russian campaign many people `had felt the need to hear the voice of the Fu&umlaut.hrer again and to <tag>derive</> new strength from his words".   

700047
In every case it is true that there is already a law applicable to the facts; it is equally true that when the decision has been given, the law is not precisely what it was before. 
The `double language" which Maine refers to as evidence of a deep-seated fiction is really an expression of a fundamental truth. 
The system of Case Law is peculiar to England and the countries which have <tag>derived</> their law from England.

The Lada Samara 1300 Select is priced at #4,444, undercutting rival 1.3 litre hatchbacks by at least #800. 
Both Lada Selects feature the same mechanical and equipment specification as the models from which they are <tag>derived</>, with the exception of a one year / 50,000 mile rather than two year / 50,000 mile manufacturer's warranty.

The presence of a lump of matter has the effect of compressing space and influences the paths of moving bodies. 
A simplistic view of Einstein's work can be <tag>derived</> by consideration of the problem in one dimension only. 

700050
Rawls was, to the best of my knowledge, the first to raise the objection that utilitarianism disregards the separateness of persons. 
The aspect of utilitarianism he seems to object to concerns its balancing feature, i.e. its willingness to take from one person and give to another, depending on who will <tag>derive</> the greater net benefit from the allocation.   

700051
The addition of herbs and spices in many combinations produces a wonderful variety of flavoursome sausages to grace any supper table, but it is really only black pudding, a breakfast sausage made with large pieces of pork back fat and pig's blood, thickened with a cereal (usually oatmeal or barley), that survives as a similar food to the continental salami or saucissons. 
It has been said that it is best not to know too much about salami and other sausages, in the same way that ignorance about haggis aids its enjoyment and easy digestion. 
Sausage-making is recorded in histories of the Roman Empire and the words sausage, salami and saucissons are all <tag>derived</> from the Latin `salsus", meaning `salted". 

700053
Rights ground duties. 
To say this is not to endorse the thesis that all duties <tag>derive</> from rights or that morality is right-based.

His answer is ringingly clear, and firmly places him as an empiricist. 
`I answer, in one word, from Experience: in that, all our knowledge is founded; and from that it ultimately <tag>derives</> itself."   

700055
Mrs Thatcher's only answer, people have been encouraged to believe, is to privatise everything that moves. 
This public backlash against the shoddy, callous and spivvy aspects of Mrs Thatcher's administration does not <tag>derive</> from the sense of chronic economic crisis which infected the politics of the 1970s but, rather, is born of prosperity.   

700056
These are the design clues that spell `Ferrari" to the countless thousands of sports enthusiasts around the world. 
And all are <tag>derived</> from one Paninfarina concept car &dash. the Dino Berlinetta Speciale &dash. which made its debut more than a quarter of a century ago at the 1965 Paris show.   

700057
The socio-economic problems in West Germany as elsewhere have given rise to an inevitable resurgence of hostility towards ethnic and other minorities, and have put some pressure on the political system itself (reflected in the emergence of the part ecological, part anti-nuclear, part general social protest `Green Party"). 
But the specific features and structural characteristics of the German socio-political culture in the short-lived and ill-fated nation-state, which conditioned the manufacture and appeal of the extraordinary `Hitler myth", were largely swept away in the whirlpool of change arising from total defeat, and were completely banished in the process of long-term change <tag>deriving</> from post-war reconstruction.

Their existence is intrinsically valuable inasmuch as the appreciation of art is intrinsically valuable. 
But their value is derivative and not ultimate.

Because the body's immune system has collapsed it is vulnerable to a host of infections which used to be encountered only as rare cases in obscure text-books. 
Many of the infections <tag>derive</> from the animal and bird world, and humans usually shrug them off.

His first step has been the mass production of prime cattle embryos. 
This allows a livestock farmer to order the foetus of his choice &dash. <tag>derived</> from, say, parents of high-quality beef stock &dash. and grow it in a low-grade surrogate.

`I hope so," said Agnes, without expressing the large doubt in her mind, knowing the kind of family from which young Bobbie Wilmore came. 
But his was one of the many families in the streets that ran off the main road at the bottom of the hill and from whom this shop and the tobacconist's <tag>derived</> most of their regular custom.

It does, however, exclude the use of coercion to discourage non-harmful opportunities. 
Can that exclusion be <tag>derived</> from the principle of autonomy?   

700064
Although Salvarsan was a considerable advance on previous treatments, it was not itself without risks and side-effects, and it was considered important to ensure that the `C/T" ratio was `propitious". 
This ratio was <tag>derived</> by dividing the `dose sufficient to destroy all parasites" by the `maximum dose which will not kill the patient"! 

700065
The ownership split will be transposed so that Scholes will hold the controlling stake. 
The Dorman Smith group's 1988 operating profit was #1.1m, <tag>derived</> from turnover of #23m, and BICC has guaranteed that current year profits will be not less than #1.7m.   

700066
The 1960 were, as we can see now, in some ways rightly to be thought of as a time of indulgence. 
Rhetorically, it was the time of the great horticultural images of education, <tag>derived</> perhaps first from Rousseau and reinforced by Froebel, for whom the child was the tender plant growing in the garden, the kindergarten.

Broken down by the war, he `walked with death, as if death were a companion", presiding over the loss of India, which, as Attlee said `a lesser man might have felt difficult to surrender".

If he wants to avoid the political, economic and social ramifications that letting hundreds of thousands of East Germans loose on the West German labour market would cause, then Bonn must help improve the living standards of those in the East. 
The second consideration <tag>derives</> from the fact that in accepting certain concessions, Mr Krenz has exposed the weaknesses of the East German government.

In a period of rapid change in the First Division, United have time to climb: they are nine points behind Liverpool with a match in hand &dash. hardly a crisis &dash. and another solid performance from Gary Pallister in central defence was encouraging. 
But the service coming through to Mark Hughes and Brian McClair, and the little they make of such scraps on offer, must concern their followers. 
They lacked the width Arsenal <tag>derived</> from Nigel Winterburn's support of Brian Marwood until the winger was supplanted by Paul Merson towards the end.   

700071
In the Enquiry, the principle that humans are capable of such disinterested feelings is left as a basic feature of their nature. 
The Treatise, however, <tag>derives</> it, in terms of the notion of `sympathy", from other, previously discovered, principles such as those of association.   

700072
Therefore in a sense one may speak of the Common Law as unwritten law in contrast with Statute Law, which is written law. 
Nevertheless, the sources from which we <tag>derive</> our knowledge of the Common Law are in writing or print.   

700073
Right from the beginning the dieter  should be learning to eat according to internal hunger cues  and not to binge. 
If the dieter feels she needs extra guidance  or added structure to meal planning, she can always refer  back to the suggested meals for good nutrition that we gave  at the end of Chapter 4. 
It is necessary for you to take this  kind of positive approach; think in terms of maximizing the  number of nutrients that you <tag>derive</> from food by eating the  right kind of balance of different foods during meals.

MGJ. 
Jefferson's `original Rough draught" of the Declaration of Independence, for July 4, 1776: When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for a people to advance from that subordination in which they have hitherto remained, &and. to assume among the powers of the earth the equal and independant station to which the laws of nature &and. of nature's god entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the change. 
We hold these truths to be sacred &and. undeniable; that all men are created equal &and. independant, that from that equal creation they <tag>derive</> rights inherent &and. inalienable, among which are the preservation of life &and. liberty, &and. the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these ends, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government shall become detructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, &and. to institute new governments, laying it's foundation on such principles &and. organising it's powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety &and. happiness &ellip

The special commissioners held that the reimbursement to two partners of the costs of moving home so they could work in the firm's offices in different parts of the country had one purpose only, namely the furtherance of the interests of the partnership practice and were, accordingly, wholly and exclusively laid out for the purposes of the profession. 
The partners moved, they held, purely for business reasons and <tag>derived</> no personal benefit from the move, which in each case proved financially disadvantageous.   

700076
And this self, in the introductory chapter, is surely right to suggest that moral sense and a sense of the numinous do not come naturally &dash. as some anthropological dismissals of religion might suggest &dash. from some crude pre-scientific attempt to explain the universe. 
The universe, viewed in those pre-chloroform days, was dark and painful and horrible, and wherever else the human race <tag>derived</> its image of a loving, moral creator, it was not from a simple contemplation of nature.   

700077
In addition, a stock farmer under such circumstances will be faced with less water in his ditches, so his cattle may escape into his neighbours' fields; it will also be more difficult for them to find clean ditch-water to drink. 
On coastal marshes, arterial drainage may encourage salt water to penetrate the ditch system, and on some of the peatlands, ochre released into the ditch system through deep drainage compounds the problems. 
When a grazing farmer takes his stock off the land to be housed indoors for the winter, as is normal, he <tag>derives</>  no benefit from the expensive pumping which keeps his neighbours' ploughland dry through the winter months.

It was like a car that was not going in the direction the driver desired, but in the direction someone else desired; as if it were driven by some mysterious, lawless hand, God knows whose, perhaps of a profiteer, or of a private capitalist, or both. 
Short of a transformation of the context from which the competitive necessities <tag>derived</>, the process of national centralization had to continue.

He's a great horseman and also a hell of a nice guy and that counts for a lot in this business." 
McGaughey, the university graduate from a well-to-do Kentucky background, seems more stand-offish, even haughty, and is clearly sensitive about his nickname `Shug" which was <tag>derived</> from his mother calling him `Sugar".   

700080
But his response is to reject the dichotomy which the objection presupposes: that such knowledge is either learnt from experience, or is innate. 
He reiterates that all knowledge is `ultimately" <tag>derived</> from the senses, but explains that this does not mean that it directly comes from it.   

700081
It was appropriate that, given India had no indigenous language accessible to all Indians, English should be used for the solemn and archaic style of this speech. 
Once awakened, as in religious conversion or falling in love, the nationalist finds a new family from which he or she <tag>derives</> pride, dignity, the opportunity for unimagined courage, contact with a supposed eternity, and `humanity" (as opposed to the mechanical arrangements of an alien bureaucracy and the market).

Hitler's next words, `I know", were followed by applause lasting minutes. 
A few months later, on 30 January 1937, he referred briefly to the beneficial effects for German culture which had been <tag>derived</> from the removal of Jewish influence, and at the opening of the `House of German Art" in Munich the following July he again scorned the Jewish contribution to the arts.

At 7 per cent higher than a year ago the altitude of the plateau may be greater than Mr Lawson would prefer, but the rarified atmosphere is slowing activity down. 
Mr Lawson can also <tag>derive</> comfort from the industrial production figures, which showed manufacturing still growing strongly.

Indeed, it seemed probable that it was the public element in the relevant body's decision, rather than the source of its powers, which was likely to provide the surest answer to the question whether the decisions of that body could be judicially reviewed. 
In the present case, his Lordship was not persuaded that the source of the Jockey Club's powers could properly be regarded as <tag>derived</> from the prerogative even though it had been set up under a Royal Charter.

Observation of the range of products being made in the late 1980s by Nairobi's jua kali artisans &dash. those who work under the `hot sun" &dash. confirm that Mutang'ang'i's story is far from unique. 
Product differentiation and improvement has been occurring steadily over the years and now includes metal and wooden window frames, doors, storage tanks, household furniture, beds, as well as a much improved range of braziers, and tin trunks. 
A good third of the stock of any hardware retail shop in Nairobi is now <tag>derived</> from this source.

Le Corbusier's opinion that a house is a machine to live in is no longer disputed; just as planners now regard a town as a machine to live in. 
Failures in the application of Functionalism have <tag>derived</> from an incorrect definition of `live in".   

700087
These are responsible for both the `power and status" motivation ascribed to Nigerian entrepreneurs, and for the centralizing tendency of governments which until recently have frequently been hostile to the informals. 
Among the many constraints on Africa's attempts at industrialization, the factors <tag>deriving</> from Africa's pre-colonial social structure must be deemed among the most important.

Precise terms of the deal were unclear last night, but some analysts suggested a share swap of six shares in Lyonaise des Eaux for five in Dumez. 
Lyonaise has interests in waste management, health care, energy and leisure, although it still <tag>derives</> 50 per cent of its profits, at FFr726 million (#73 million) in 1989, from its water activities.

The audience have heard his story; it will give them satisfaction to see him and hear what he has to say and what the Chorus have to say to him. 
Dramatic genius has taken a forward step; here is the suggestion of a new technique: the telling of one man's story for the dramatic values to be <tag>derived</> from the man himself, as well as those arising from the story and from the reactions of the Chorus.

Mr Dua's latest plans include setting up a Celtic Society in India, establishing a language school and a museum displaying relics from the history of famous Celtic rulers alongside books, arts, crafts and Celtic products. 
His interest in the Celtic `nations" <tag>derives</> from his father, who was educated at Glasgow University, and his uncle, who was a GP in Edinburgh.   

700092
The black inhabitants of Haiti speak French, as do the Indians of Mauritius. 
The French speak a language <tag>derived</> from that small group of speakers of Latin who conquered Gaul at the beginning of the first millennium AD, although they suppose they are descended more from the Gauls than the Romans.  

700093
`The problem is that the group has to try and grow what have been static businesses", according to Mr David Lang, food analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite, the stockbroker. 
Only 10-12 per cent of Marmite/Bovril's approximately #35m in annual sales is <tag>derived</> from UK markets, according to CPC. 

700094
How you deal with soil and leaf pests in general depends on whether you are a chemical or a `green" gardener. 
Chemical gardeners rely on strong chemical poisons to zap pests, and in doing so run the risk of harming beneficial garden creatures. 
`Green" gardeners are concerned with preventing damage to the environment, so they use less powerful deterrents, many <tag>derived</> from plants.   

700095
This famous and much-discussed distinction between primary and secondary qualities has historical antecedents in Galileo, Descartes, and Hobbes. 
Since it was generally associated with the corpuscular theory of matter it was a common idea in Locke's time, though its details, and the arguments from which it was <tag>derived</>, were not always the same.   

700096
[it] either comes through the senses, or is formed from those which come through the senses." 
All our ideas are <tag>derived</> from experience, and he argues, against Descartes, that there are no innate ideas which are with us at birth. 

700097
The observation of a particular instance of a cause and its effect gives us no impression of `any power or necessary connection; any quality, which binds the effect to the cause, and renders the one an infallible consequence of the other". 
Perhaps, then, the idea is <tag>derived</> from the consciousness we have of our power over our own bodies?   

700098
For Norman Lewis this experience illustrates his conviction that writers should enjoy their craft, for the result of not doing so is to end up like Hemingway. 
Lewis is modest and self-effacing, reluctant to catapult his achievements at you, rather preferring to work unseen, offering finished works from which an observer or narrator seems absent. 
`I feel that I am doing a job as well as I can, and I also feel that I am capable of <tag>deriving</> pleasure from it.

In responding to Mr Bryan Armitage's letter I will use his figures to demonstrate the true state of affairs. 
It will not be disputed that about half the money to be spent by the county council is in future to be <tag>derived</> directly from central government and about a quarter from the proceeds of the uniform business rate. 

700102
Others are denied one so that one will improve one's options in the future. 
In judging the value of negative freedom one should never forget that it <tag>derives</> from its contribution to autonomy.

(A, 334). 
Far from being an emblem of wholeness, this woman is fragmented, lacking, and she <tag>derives</> from her lack the nervous energy of desire.   

700106
Yet the dream had a certain ambivalence after all. 
Liberating while attempting to control all the resentment and sense of oppression of the lower strata was notoriously liable to backfire on those confident enough to undertake the task, even if such resentment was couched in cultural terms from which such leaders also <tag>derived</> their legitimacy.   

700107
He was 76, and had succeeded to the Presidency three years ago on the retirement of Count Edward Raczynski (the Polish ambassador to the Court of St James from 1934 to 1945). 
Before that, he had been for ten years Prime Minister of the Council of Ministers in London, not so much a shadow cabinet as a cabinet of political ghosts whose dogged persistence over nearly half a century and apparent constitutional legitimacy once more haunts the Warsaw government <tag>deriving</> its legitimacy chiefly from the Realpolitik of Yalta. 

700108
I spoke to David on the phone yesterday and he, too, has been able to do very little because of not being able to get into Tim's program, like everybody else. 
I have, as a result of the new storyboard, got a detailed list of proposals and suggestions from the new programmer which I am faxing to you (eight pages to follow), and which will form the basis of formal discussions between the programmer and myself and possibly David, and from which we have to <tag>derive</> a proper technical specification.   

700109
Epicurus taught, therefore, a thoroughgoing materialism according to which our world is simply the chance production of atoms coming together in their fall through an infinite void. 
There are gods, but they too are only material combinations of atoms, and our own consciousness ceases at death on the disintegration of our material bodies. 
Such a picture &dash. <tag>derived</> essentially from the earlier atomist Democritus &dash. may seem bleak to some, but to Epicurus and his followers it was productive of the calm ataraxia he valued.   

700110
It may be claimed that by defining rights as based on the well-being of individuals I have ruled out of court the view that morality is rights-based. 
By definition rights are not fundamental but <tag>derive</> from interests.

He was used to advertise Players' cigarettes but was not even paid a proper fee. 
`Dixie' &dash. a nickname said to <tag>derive</> from his swarthy complexion and curly black hair &dash. preferred to augment his income by making bets with bookmakers on the basis of the number of goals he could score in a game (one goal was evens, two goals 5-2, and three 10- 1), Sportsmen, especially footballers, had since the 1880s been used on cigarette cards as free advertising for a brand.   

700112
The enormous coverage given to the New York election reflects the importance of that metropolis both to its people and as a command post of the world economy. 
Fascination with the city undoubtedly also <tag>derives</> in part from its condition as `a carnival on the edge of frenzy" (Professor Ronald Dworkin; quoted in `Calcutta of the Western World", 7 November).   

700113
On the medical front, he points to a project being undertaken by the Agricultural and Food Research Council in Edinburgh, which has gone some way towards producing the clotting protein Factor Nine, the lack of which causes profuse bleeding in haemophiliacs. 
Until now, Factor Nine has been <tag>derived</> from pooled blood transfusions, a system which permitted the transmission of the HIV virus before the introduction of screening and heat inactivation.   

700114
Third, the incompatible virtues exemplify diverse fundamental concerns. 
They do not <tag>derive</> from a common source, or from common ultimate principles.  

700115
The various issues raised here will receive closer attention as we work our way in greater detail through the law. 
The criticisms that we make <tag>derive</> strength from an analysis of other jurisdictions with similar common-law backgrounds and the same liberal democratic traditions as the United Kingdom. 

700116
The second (the interest of persons that others will be free to communicate with them) and third (the interest of people to live in a society in which communication is free &dash. even if they personally do not wish to communicate with others) are interests of people other than the right-holder in his right. 
In the Common Law freedom of expression is regularly defended, where it is defended, on grounds of the public interest, that is on the interests of third parties. 
The right-holder's interest itself, conceived independently of its contribution to the public interest, is deemed insufficient to justify holding others to be subject to the extensive duties and disabilities commonly <tag>derived</> from the right of free speech.   

700117
However, both expect the amendments to pass. 
One of the amendments would tax a foreign investor on gains <tag>derived</> from the sale of shares in a US company in which the investor owned 10 per cent or more of the outstanding shares.   

700118
There may be a certain sadness in her facial expression but there is also great dignity in her upright posture and undaunted gaze. 
Mireille's pose is more relaxed, her flesh more apparent under her gown, but her sensuous embodiement is not offered to the spectator's voyeurism as much as it is turned away from him, as if her stretched-out arm were barring the way to a more immediate apprehension. 
The woman standing on the far right of the picture <tag>derives</> from a series of images Lautrec painted of prostitutes waiting for their periodic medical exam. 

700119
Thus, according to Bacon, 
that wisdom which we have <tag>derived</> principally from the Greeks is but like the boyhood of knowledge, and has the characteristic property of boys: it can talk, but it cannot generate; for it is fruitful of controversies but barren of works. &ellip. If sciences of this kind had any life in them, that could never come to pass which has been the case now for many ages &dash. that they stand almost at a stay, without receiving any augmentations worthy of the human race; insomuch that many times &ellip. what was asserted once is asserted still &ellip. and instead of being resolved by discussion is only fixed and fed". 

700120
In these cases, as at Keewenaw, the copper is  concentrated in the vesicular, scoriaceous tops of the lava flows, where  it often fills in the open spaces completely. 
Most of the individual bits of copper metal are quite small, but some  larger lumps have been found &dash. the biggest of them a 230 kilogram mass. 
The tops of the Keewenaw lavas are all reddened and oxidized, a fairly  common condition for basalts, and it has been suggested that oxygen  <tag>derived</> from iron oxides in the basalt combined with the sulphur from earlier copper sulphide minerals, effectively `reducing" them to native  copper. 

700121
By that is meant not the preoccupations of the individual with material possessions but philosophical materialism. 
It is the depiction of men and women as creatures of their context, their sensations ultimately <tag>derived</> from the involuntary conditions of circumstance, their transcendence denied.   

700122
Another, who did not pass by on the hour, might think, not of Death, but of the astrolabe showing the positions of the planets. 
Though different in detail, these ideas are similar, in that they both <tag>derive</> from the clock's observable characteristics and behaviour.   

700123
After the war he became an art student, but gave up in 1949 to study for four years at the National Film School in Lodz. 
His 1958 film Ashes and Diamonds put Polish cinema on the international map. 
Set on the last day of the war and the first day of the peace, the story <tag>derives</> much of its power from the tension between intense Polishness and impassioned scepticism about the national tradition of romantic heroism.   

700124
Last season they surrendered six points to Derby, and on Saturday they handed over two more after creating enough opportunities &dash. manager George Graham counted nine &dash. to massage the meekest of egos. 
Few Arsenal players will <tag>derive</> much pleasure from pondering their performances, but if anyone is waking up at night screaming it will be Niall Quinn. 

700125
In addition to the actual inventory balance for each category, the report also gives a standard, or target, that provides a basis for judging how well inventory is being controlled. 
The standard for dryers, for example, is $243 thousand, which is <tag>derived</> by aggregating the standard inventory level for each of the individual dryer SKUs.   

700127
There was a fair deal of Oxbridge waffle around about history being `a training of the mind", a means of understanding the other chap's point of view. 
From Dutch historian Gustav Renier I <tag>derived</> the formulation that history is a social necessity: in face of government philistinism and the fantasies of cultural theory, this, I believe, is the bedrock upon which claims for a proper respect for historical study should be founded.   

700128
To simplify I shall not dwell specifically on rights as the grounds of powers. 
Some rights <tag>derive</> from others.   

700129
Idomeneo opens at the ROH on Mon. 
Since it was in the interests of justice that the owner of a stolen confidential file should have a civil remedy against the person who had stolen the file, a journalist was required to disclose his source of information which had been <tag>derived</> from the stolen file in order that the owner could bring civil proceedings to recover the file.  

700130
Political artists count for little; instead, the forms and conventions of mainstream entertainment are simply applied to the great offices of state. 
Like Bob Hope but unlike Constantin Chernenko, Mr. Reagan felt the need for catchphrases, usually showbiz <tag>derived</>: `Let's make it one more for the Gipper" is a line he said in a biopic of the baseball player George Gipp; `You ain't seen nothin' yet" is the merest amendment of Al Jolson's standard intro. But not even the Great Communicator can match the synthesis of life and art achieved by the Kennedy Presidency. 

700131
There are other ways of making agreements but their analysis does not matter for our purpose. 
So far we have discussed the right to promise. 
The right which the promise confers on the promisee does not <tag>derive</> from the right to promise which is a right of the promisor. 

700132
Also, with no common denominator for fixing rates, different criteria were used for measuring performance &dash. tonnage, yardage, cubic measures, number of operations completed, etc. &dash. and so contradictory interests developed. 
In response to these difficulties a different form of work organisation, <tag>deriving</> from the single-place tradition, was developed.   

700133
The eccentricities of the judges have the same stupefying unfunniness &dash. however witty &dash. as those of a schoolteacher. 
The courtrooms themselves are much smaller than one would imagine, from the size of the issues dealt with in them, while the great hall of the courts, which would, in a palace, be impressive, has red benches all around its edges, on which hurried sandwich lunches are consumed, the wrappers stuffed into ashtrays afterwards. 
The majesty of the law does not <tag>derive</> from pomp, but from fear. 

700136
This is how her sexual organ manages to detach itself from the body of a `bonne fille toujours," sacrificial scapegoat of the circulus, and to rise in triumph above its death-driven victims. 
The poison she brings with her, which causes the varnished surface of society to crack and decompose, may derive its venom less from repressed libidinal instincts than it does from the ferment of representation itself, undermining natural reference, hystericizing its body, and infecting its vital circulus with a corrosive morbidity. 
I have argued that the originality and force of Nana <tag>derives</> from the way it simultaneously generates two conflicting interpretive networks for male fantasmatic apprehension of female sexuality.   

700137
Likewise, the partnership's executive committee, in paying the expenses, had been motivated solely by the consideration that it would benefit the partnership to have these two partners living near their new offices. 
In so holding, the commissioners clearly regarded the firm as an entity quite separate from the partners whose expenses were being repaid, and looked not at all at the immediate purpose of those expenses, namely the establishment of personal residences for themselves and their families, but solely at the advantages the firm would <tag>derive</> from having those partners residing in their new locations.   

700138
The basalts  collected at each individual landing site tended to be similar to one  another, but there were significant differences between the rocks from  different sites. 
This indicates that the basalts were <tag>derived</> from more  than one primary source, rather than from a single common `pool" of magma  as some earlier speculations had suggested.   

700139
Ought interviewers to be retaliating by demanding new forms of training for themselves? 
Or is there a case for devising new forms of more explicitly adversarial programmes, perhaps <tag>derived</> from the model of the courtroom, where the normal constraints against tough lines of questioning are relaxed?   

700140
By that time the Everyman's new artistic director, John Doyle, and his permanent company will have worked their way through an ambitious and unusually schematic programme culminating in two works of twentieth-century apocalypse: a Solzhenitsyn piece from the Gulag, and the Chernobyl play Sarcophagus. 
But they begin at the beginning, with three works <tag>derived</> from the Greeks; the first is Euripides's dramatised cantata of desolation, The Trojan Women.   

700141
Less well-known dissenters have, according to their families, simply disappeared. 
A feature of the Timisoara demonstration, and of the last major protest against the regime in Romania's second largest city of Brasov in November 1987, was its spontaneity, one <tag>derived</> from the sheer despair of its inhabitants. 

700142
The big city stations of the nineteenth century reflected to the full the Victorians' unashamed belief in monumentality. 
In the case of the railway companies, it was a belief <tag>derived</> from a number of sources.   

700143
However, I find it very hard to imagine how society can be said to benefit in any way at all from the continuance of such a barbaric activity. 
Those who engage in what is inaptly referred to as the `sport" may well argue that they <tag>derive</> some enjoyment from hunting.   

700144
With pleasure. 
The same cannot be said of Tour de France 1990 (C4), which spoils a lot of nice views of French countryside by intruding an unaesthetic snake of bicyclists into the picture at all times, but the coverage included an interesting item about the Caravan Publicitaire, a procession of cars and vans and novelty vehicles which covers the route ahead of the racers and distributes plastic carrier bags and similar tat to the over-excited populace and <tag>derives</> much publicity and goodwill for the commercial sponsors. 

700145
Another, more general, prima facie argument will have to wait till later in the book. 
Even though deontological and teleological considerations are distinct they <tag>derive</> from a common moral core.   

700146
The rapid changes in the membership and electoral fortunes of Scots, Welsh, Quebecois and no doubt other nationalist parties of the past 20 years illustrate this instability. 
Such parties, as always, like to equate themselves with the sense of collective separateness, hostility to `them" and the `imagined community" which may be almost universally flet in their `nation", but they are very unlikely to be the only expression of such a national consensus. 
The declining historical significance of nationalism is today concealed not only by the visible spread of ethnic / linguistic agitations, but also by the semantic illusion which <tag>derives</> from the fact that all states are today officially `nations", though many of them patently have nothing in common with what the term `nation-state" is commonly held to mean; that therefore all movements seeking to win independence think of themselves as establishing nations even when they are patently not doing so; and that centralisation and state bureaucracy will, if they possibly can, put on the fashionable national costume.   

700147
His ideas and his pursuit of them were often unorthodox and only slowly accepted by the established medical-scientific community. 
It was Hugh Sinclair who postulated that the low incidence of heart disease and strokes in Greenland eskimos might be a consequence of eating large amounts of oily fish and seal meat. 
From this concept, which he proposed 40 years ago, much of the current interest in fish oils and vegetable oils has been <tag>derived</>. 

700148
However, our council has declared firmly that Diwali is the Indian Christmas, so our borough has two Diwalis. 
There is the mysterious Indian D, with customs that may <tag>derive</> from fire worship.   

700149
War service as an officer in the Royal Artillery helped to broaden his horizons, develop his capacity for leadership and on his return compelled him to re-examine some of the traditional practices in the service. 
His experience was further enhanced by serving with the police and prison mission to Greece to advise on the penal system before returning to the original Borstal, named after the village of Borstal near Rochester, as deputy governor in 1948. 
He was a big man in every sense of that word, paternalistic without being condescending, and <tag>derived</> as much pleasure if not more from having a game of table-tennis or chatting with the lads as having a convivial social evening outside.   

700154
His latest novel, The Dark Half, just published by Hodder and Stoughton ( #12.95), also looks set to be a best-seller. 
His success <tag>derives</> partly from his shrewd understanding that fantasy needs to be built on a solid base of prosaic reality. 

700155
Is this your concept of the dignity of the profession? 
Cannot you entertain the notion that people (and not only academics!) take pride in what they do, <tag>derive</> satisfaction from doing it well?   

700156
In this case the delights and satisfactions we take in virtue will be a product of deliberation and judgement. 
Hume, therefore, begins by considering `a controversy started of late &ellip. concerning the general foundation of Morals; whether they be <tag>derived</> from Reason, or from Sentiment". 

700157
Thus at a time when Africa needs to industrialize, to create both exports and jobs, a review of the last thirty years shows how difficult this task has been and will be. 
A good part of the difficulty is <tag>derived</> directly from the structure of social and cultural values discussed earlier in this book.  

700158
The Labour College movement originated with a students' strike at Ruskin College in 1909. 
Alienated by the attempts of Oxford University to gain control of the education offered at the College, an autonomous institution linked with the labour movement, the strikers set up the `Plebs League" which, through its journal Plebs Magazine (as it was originally called), encouraged the formation of schools and classes based on the principle of `Independent Working Class Education" (IWCE). 
From this initiative <tag>derived</> a number of Labour Colleges in the coalfields, industrial cities, and especially in South Wales and Scotland.   

700159
The original Los Desamperados (`the abandoned ones") was burnt down earlier this century and was replaced by an earthquake-proof Italianate structure clad in cream-coloured stucco. 
Its name is a curious comment since it is situated beside the back garden of the Presidential palace, and boasts only one train a day. 
Most of the Andean stations have an abandoned air and see few trains, although those in the capital cities <tag>derive</> a certain faded grandeur from the fact that their buildings often incorporate the headquarters of the railway companies. 

700160
LORD JUSTICE NEILL said that as the case had been heard by the judge alone, it was open to the Court of Appeal to deal with his finding on the ordinary principles on which the court reconsidered a judge's findings of fact. 
From these, his Lordship <tag>derived</> the following guidelines.

`We see North America as our home base," says Mr Al Flood, president of CIBC's corporate banking division. 
Bank of Montreal has set itself a target of <tag>deriving</> half its profits from US operations, up from about 26 per cent last year.   

700164
The achievement of a new State transforms a national liberation movement into something quite different, necessitating quite often a change of leadership, of support groups, of style and programme. 
This is because the central disciplines over a new State <tag>derive</> from the world system of competitive and unequal States and the continuing struggle to preserve national independence.   

700165
But Poland's people, as usual, have a way of coping with their troubles: they turn to romance. 
Though it is a country where most material things are squalidly measured in dollars rather than the national zloties, it is also one where men still routinely kiss women's hands in greeting &dash. and at farewell &dash. even when they hardly know each other and where women do not hide the pleasure they <tag>derive</> from such old-fashioned niceties.  

700166
There is little to suggest any aesthetic vulgarity or antipathy to culture on their part. 
The contemporary defamation of their name manifestly <tag>derives</> from Jewish (and thereby Christian) hostility and prejudice. 

700168
Even he should respect them. 
Some will say that that requirement of respect is <tag>derived</> from the requirement to respect other persons, some of whom have an interest in art.   

700169
Thus he limits his hypothesis of a correspondence between ideas and impressions to the case of simples. 
In support of this more limited claim he points out that blind men, incapable of colour impressions, have no colour ideas, and suggests that we perform the experiment of analysing our thoughts or ideas to test their reducibility to simple ideas, which are copied from experienced impressions. 
`Those who would assert that this position is not universally true &ellip. have only one, and that an easy method of refuting it; by producing that idea, which, in their opinion, is not <tag>derived</> from this source."   

700170
Those are agent-relative reasons. 
A person who made a promise has an agent-relative reason to keep it, even though it may <tag>derive</> from an agent-neutral reason to keep one's promises.   

700171
Let us assume that I own a whole street because I bought (in separate transactions) all its houses. 
My ownership of a house in the street does not <tag>derive</> from my ownership of the street as a whole, even though the statement that I own a house in the street is entailed by the statement that I own the street.   

700172
At this point, as Carr observes, `the dividing line between Bukharin's thesis of `self-determination for the workers" and the Polish thesis (of Rosa Luxemburg) of `no self-determination for nations" was tenuous and tended to vanish". 
Stalin's argument was part of a broader one that he <tag>derived</> from Lenin: the right of national self-determination was valid only where countries were passing from feudalism to capitalism. 

700173
United have lost only one of their last six games, with Hughes contributing six of their 13 goals, while Lineker has claimed seven out of 15 during the same period. 
FOLLOWERS of football on North Humberside, deprived of success by their ailing professional club, can <tag>derive</> much satisfaction from the form of the city's schoolboy team.   

700174
Each manufacturer approached the task in a slightly different way, but basically each product endeavours to provide the epidermal cells with the nutrients needed to mimic the performance of younger, more efficient skin. 
Kanebo's La Creme, for instance, uses bio-technology &dash. which encompasses such processes as cell fusion, tissue culture and gene manipulation &dash. to bring together some of the most important anti-ageing ingredients from the natural world and the research laboratory. 
Other interesting youth-preserving ingredients which work together to promote cell rejuvenation and boost capillary circulations (functions that grow sluggish with time) are apricot essence B15, and a form of vitamin E called Tocopherol nicotinate, <tag>derived</> from polished rice.   

700175
Hence his existence is intrinsically but derivatively valuable. 
Some people are willing to go further and to hold that the value of the relationship between the man and the dog <tag>derives</> equally from its contribution to the well-being of the dog and that the dog's well-being is not merely derivatively important because of its contribution to the man's well-being.   

700176
Huysmans's fictions open most transparently onto the stage of the fantasmatic in the many remarkable dream narratives interspersed throughout their representational space. 
These accounts are, on the one hand, carefully controlled literary structures, whose themes and images <tag>derive</> from and elaborate material already presented in the text, and whose artistic purpose is to give the reader the illusion of actual oneiric experience.   

700178
I don't want to be critical, sir, but your advice is useless. 
I've been following it for years, and have never <tag>derived</> any practical advantage from any of your books.   

700179
An explanation is required of my reported comment (9 December) that Sir Winston Churchill would not like what is going on today in Parliament. 
Such displeasure does not <tag>derive</> from the increase in pensions for war widows, although it may perhaps apply to the long delay in this being granted, but rather to the abandonment by increasing numbers among all the main parties of Parliament's prime constitutional role of keeping a check upon the Executive. 

700180
Organization in our world refers to rational organization, but artistic organization is associative and emotional rather than rational. 
Rank explains it in terms of the male female dichotomy: `Since modern psychology is not only masculine but <tag>derived</> from our neurotic type of man, a great deal of its terminology originated from a misinterpretation of woman in terms of man's sexual ideology."   

700181
There is also a more precise way in which we use this distinction between law and laws. 
Some laws are presented to us as having from the beginning a separate and independent existence; they are not <tag>derived</> by any process of analysis or development from the law as a whole.   

700182
One of the most striking of all the mission stations was opened by the Santa Fe at Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1910. 
It was a vast complex of buildings, a mission in the fullest sense with several towers surmounted by triple crowns. 
The buildings <tag>derived</> their interest from these towers and from the complex interrelationship of the elements.  

700183
The case against Beesley was adjourned until April 2 for the preparation of social inquiry reports. 
The permancy of bricks and mortar from which the Nationwide Anglia Building Society <tag>derived</> its strength is denied to its Wallingford office right now.   

700184
The sporty 1.5-litre twin-cam coupe, known on the home market as the Cynos, is gunning straight for the Honda CRX and Nissan NX coupe &dash. but not in the UK, because exports to this country aren't planned. 
Overlook the oddball Cynos badge on the back (Cynos is <tag>derived</> from cynosure, or centre of attention) and the cute rear-drive Toyota coupe has plenty going for it.

All the time, we have to trade off greed and prudence." 
Another reason analysts are sceptical about Hammerson <tag>derives</> from the extent to which John Parry is seen not as a substitute for Mr Mason &dash. particularly in view of the extent to which Mr Mason continues to play an active part in running the company.

Hungarian brigades were accused of perpetrating atrocities in Transylvania during the Second World War. 
The Ceausescu version of Transylvanian history relied heavily on an extreme school of Romanian nationalist writing fashionable during the inter-war period, and which <tag>derived</> from prejudice rather than rational investigation.

He hints that it would be wrong to `persist in regarding knowledge as the certain and evident cognition of a thing, obtained through an acquaintance with its necessary cause, or by a proof", for then `knowledge through experience or appearances would not merit the name of knowledge". 
Perhaps one should `allow that a certain knowledge <tag>derived</> from our experience of the appearances of things should be termed genuine knowledge".   

700192
Some have suggested that rights are distinctive in that, while being based on individual interests, they are given greater weight than is due to that interest. 
But if rights are given greater weight than is warranted by the interest they protect considered in itself, this is presumably due to considerations which do not <tag>derive</> from concern for the well-being of the right-holder.   

700193
The record has a certain gloomy power, but you can't help feeling that by trying to be Bruce Mellencamp, Earle is ignoring his real strengths. 
But Earle can <tag>derive</> comfort from the fact that it is impossible to sink as low as Crosby Stills &and. Nash, whose Live It Up sounds like a fifth-rate Bee Gees auditioning for the job of house band at a tacky Atlantic City slot-machine joint. 

700194
All innocence, he calls out `Good old England. 
Up the Empire!" to a group of communist students from the UK gathered at the bar of his hotel, promises to do something about the `blooming awful" state of Soviet plumbing and ends up making a deal with Stalin with the insouciance of George Formby addressing himself to Hitler. 
Later in the same decade, when British filmmakers had lost their interest in international affairs, the same actor, George Cole, plays the inadequate gang-leader in Too Many Crooks (1959), a film whose insights into the cold realities of contemporary marriage <tag>derives</> from the story of a kidnapped wife who plots revenge when her husband shows himself less than interested in paying over her ransom.   

700195
Tradition: 
that which we have always done and believed and from which we have <tag>derived</> our social forms.   

700196
Besides explaining the formation of our `matter of fact" beliefs by reference to the associative principles of `cause and effect", Hume also looks closely at the idea of `cause". 
Involved in it, he finds, is the idea of `succession", for effects follow their causes; the idea of `contiguity" in time and space, for unless `linked by a chain of causes", effects are not distant from their causes; and finally, since causes are taken to produce their effects, the idea of some `necessary connection" between the two. 
This last idea is certainly not the least important for Hume, and, putting the others aside, he tries to locate the impression from which it is <tag>derived</>.   

700197
Try digesting this morsel with your Christmas lunch. 
`The report suggests that rational credit use occurs when the utility <tag>derived</> from the immediate consumption outweighs the disutility of consumption foregone in the future.   

700198
There is something verging on the farcical about reading such sad stuff in such a setting, where the figures revered seem so much at variance with the evidence contained in the sanctum. 
It produces the same feeling of shock that one <tag>derives</> from attending Walter Hooper's meetings of the C. S. Lewis Society in Oxford, where a High Church, celibate C. S. Lewis is reverenced.   

700199
It is just like the kind of X-ray you might have &dash. you don't go away radioactive afterwards." 
`The irradiation process uses either electron beam machines or gamma radiation which is <tag>derived</> from cobalt 60, a radio isotope also used in medical therapy. 

700200
When that school closed after the 1982 season, and a committee was formed to attempt to found a replacement, she shouldered the administrative burden involved. 
After a long search for a suitable venue, negotiations were concluded with the Royal National College for the Blind in Hereford, where the school has been held since 1986. 
The concept of an integrated school combining courses for solo and choral singers, and for solo pianists and accompanists, is characteristic of Hereford, and <tag>derives</> largely from Suzanne Judelson's conviction that musicians of all standards and disciplines should have the opportunity to meet and learn from each other.   

700201
Moreover, the record shows a strong negative correlation between delay and the amount recovered (and, presumably, claimed). 
Insurance companies have been accused of systematically exploiting the vulnerability of the more seriously injured claimants by artificial delays, from which the companies <tag>derive</> the added advantage of earning income on their invested funds in the meantime and of seeing claimants become increasingly less able to sustain a successful trial with the flux of time.   

700202
THERE IS still a 100 per cent record in the First Division. 
Sadly for Barrow, it is comprised of defeats, although they could <tag>derive</> a scrap of satisfaction from yesterday's 62-6 reverse at Wigan.   

700203
It's possible that the longest-lasting effects may have been due to  chemical precipitation of sulphates on the tiny condensation nuclei that  are always present in the atmosphere. 
The sulphates, of course, would  have been <tag>derived</> from the copious volumes of sulphur dioxide carried up  into the atmosphere during the eruption.   

700204
It is a consequence of the preceding observations that people's well-being is to a considerable extent a function of their non-biologically determined goals: goals which they have but could have avoided. 
To the extent that every person has reason to act in the interest of others his reasons <tag>derive</> from their goals.   

700205
Frequently difficulties are of a sexual nature. 
Finding out that a husband is not only dressing up as a woman but <tag>deriving</> sexual pleasure from it, perhaps masturbating whilst dressed in front of a mirror, can threaten her own sexuality.   

700206
The Hayes Society claimed to admit butlers of `only the very first rank". 
Much of the power and prestige it went on to gain <tag>derived</> from the fact that unlike other such organizations which have come and gone, it managed to keep its numbers extremely low, thus giving this claim some credibility. 

700207
This made it fun to guess the images that the music suggested: which was easiest in the concluding movement, where the four players took it in turns to sustain a high E, while the rest swished their bows at each other as if in mortal combat. 
Steve Reich's Different Trains took us into the realms of documentary: its basic melodic ideas <tag>derived</> from speech samples taken from recordings of the composer's governess, three holocaust survivors and a retired Pullman porter, all recollecting wartime train journeys. 

700209
The film feels like one of those movies carved out of a television mini-series, where every scene makes you aware of the lack of information necessary to empathize with the people on the screen and grasp the significance of their actions. 
But the main problem <tag>derives</> from Joffe&acute.'s decision to try and make the audience identify with two characters, a penitent slave trader and a Jesuit priest, as they take their individual routes to confront the armies sent in to break up the Jesuit missions and massacre the converted Indians.   

700210
So does Felipe. 
Their magic over the Spanish masses <tag>derives</> from their remoteness."   

700211
According to Levi, this simply showed a disrespect for the reader. 
Perhaps Levi's impatience with obscurity, his desire to communicate at all costs, <tag>derived</> from the absolute lack of communication at Auschwitz, where there was only, as he said, a debased vocabulary full of savage imperatives, insults, blasphemies and imprecations.   

700212
My fantasy life had not been anaesthetised. 
I believe staff anxieties about me watching the procedure <tag>derived</> from an assumption that if I watched the horror film of my own mutilation I would suffer.   

700213
One thing that appears in his discussion of them is a preparedness to say that a `simple" idea may not be absolutely, and in all contexts, simple. 
Evidently he thinks of the distinction as being no more than a useful device for developing and explaining his claim, that all ideas <tag>derive</> from experience.  

700214
All that emerges from it is the sheer nastiness of a group of homosexual writers for whom the working classes were not much more than a floating brothel. 
It is not pleasant to read the account of the plot got up to entice Forster's boyfriend Bob Buckingham away from his wife, and not difficult to agree with PC Daley's description of the Forster circle as `pimps". 
If Ackerley <tag>derived</> any satisfaction from this rough, rackety, frustrated life it was in his work at The Listener, where his enlightened editorial policies make him sound like a reviewer's dream (he telephoned contributors at midnight to query the removal of a comma).   

700215
You could say that it's deconstruction's favourite trope. 
Hillis Miller compares it to following a mountain path and then finding that it gives out, leaving you stranded on a ledge, unable to go back or forwards. 
It actually <tag>derives</> from a Greek word meaning `a pathless path".   

700216
But for the moment Cooke is content that England have the player to succeed Paul Rendall. 
Cooke can also <tag>derive</> satisfaction from the welcome return to form of Nigel Redman at lock, from the possible emergence of Dean Ryan and Tim Rodber in the back row, from the enterprising Nigel Heslop on the wing and, despite his hesitation last Saturday against Buenos Aires, from the promise of Gavin Thompson.   

700217
We are to envisage a moral theory the fundamental principles of which state that certain individuals have certain rights. 
They are its fundamental principles for, first, their justification does not presuppose any other moral principles, and, secondly, all valid moral views <tag>derive</> from them (with the addition of premisses which do not by themselves yield any moral conclusions).  

700218
There is, I know, a belief that it sucks a tree dry, but this is a misconception. 
It <tag>derives</> its sustenance from the ground, through its roots, and clings to its host only for support.   

700219
Sources comprised 21 transcripts of interviews with women of that time and womens" magazines of the period. 
Ultimately inspiration for her doctorate <tag>derived</> from personal circumstances.   

700220
Nevertheless, even though having angles equal to two right angles is not part of a triangle's essence, it is because it is a three-sided plane figure that it has them. 
Properties of this sort were supposed to `flow", `derive", or `emanate" from the form. 
As Aquinas says, `a thing's characteristic operations <tag>derive</> from its substantial form".   

700221
Sir: 
A painting by Rembrandt, or anybody else, <tag>derives</> a significant proportion of its potency from its relationship with other works by that artist and, consequently, a deattribution robs it of all the richness of association ('Experts cast doubt on 20 `Rembrandts" ', 8 December).   

700222
Zola had requested). 
He did, however, send the master a weighty scientific volume, P. Toussaint Barthe&acute.lemy's Recherches sur la variole, from which Zola <tag>derived</> his clinical picture.   

700223
In responding to Mr Bryan Armitage's letter I will use his figures to demonstrate the true state of affairs. 
It will not be disputed that about half the money to be spent by the county council is in future to be derived directly from central government and about a quarter from the proceeds of the uniform business rate. 
For each authority, this is to be a fixed sum and expenditure above that level is to be <tag>derived</> from the community charge.   

700224
Is personal autonomy valuable? 
Its description in the first two sections above may make it appear an appealing ideal. 
But does its value <tag>derive</> from the fact that many people desire to be autonomous?  

700225
Market sources said that the Ivory Coast seems again to be selling cocoa, and perhaps 200,000 tonnes of Ivorian material will be available. 
Some comfort has also been <tag>derived</> from the price of the December contract, which fell from #753 a tonne a week ago to #741 a tonne on Friday.   

700226
Unity is the geometric mean in the series 0.618, 1, 1.618 and, therefore, is known as the golden mean. 
This ratio can also be <tag>derived</> algebraically by dividing a line, length b + 1, at a point where the ratio of the parts is equal to the ratio of the larger part to the sum. 

700228
There was no express statutory power which entitled the council to enter into the transactions. 
If authority existed, it <tag>derived</> from section 111(1) of the Local Government Act 1972, which provided that local authorities should have power to do anything which was `calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge of any of their functions". 

700229
Consider the argument of Nicos Foulantzas who asserts that nations are as old as or older than class society (as if the two modes of analysis are not mutually reinforcing), will persist after the State disappears, and possess a `transhistorical irreducibility". 
Nations are, he says, the basis of the State, and national struggles <tag>derive</> not from social classes but from historical entities called nations.   

700231
One of the first was from the Borovansky Ballet in Australia to mount Poll for them. 
Thus it happened that he went off to work iii another new continent at just about the time Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet visited South Africa with three of his ballets (Pineapple Poll, The Lady and the Fool, Beauty and the Beast) in their programmes, giving John's former colleagues there a chance to assess his development since leaving Cape Town. 
The Australian production of Poll was given during a long season by the Borovansky company in Melbourne, and proved a popular addition to a repertory that <tag>derived</> heavily (in its creations as well is its revivals) from Edouard Borovansky's origins in the Ballets Russes. 

700232
What had she expected? 
Nothing, certainly, so like the satanic mills of the early Industrial Revolution. 
Robyn's mental image of a modern factory had <tag>derived</> mainly from TV commercials and documentaries: deftly edited footage of brightly coloured machines and smoothly moving assembly lines, manned by brisk operators in clean overalls, turning out motor cars or transistor radios to the accompaniment of Mozart on the sound track.   

700233
Such an interest would not, of course justify holding me to have the right. 
A right is a morally fundamental right if it is justified on the ground that it serves the right-holder's interest in having that right inasmuch as that interest is considered to be of ultimate value, i.e. inasmuch as the value of that interest does not <tag>derive</> from some other interest of the right-holder or of other persons.   

700234
His conclusion was that his data `provided support for neither Mallet nor Blauner" (Gallie 1978, 298). 
Their view that the main traditional sources of grievance in industry &dash. salaries, and problems <tag>deriving</> from the nature of the work task and of work organisation &dash. would cease to be of importance as a focus of grievance in continuous-process industries turned out to be unsupported.   

700235
If the parent intrusive body was poor in ore minerals, then  the hydrothermal solutions from it will also be poor, and the only  minerals that result will be unimportant, unusable things like quartz  and calcite (calcium carbonate). 
But if the intrusive rock was <tag>derived</> from a particularly metal-rich bit  of oceanic crust, then not only will it have a high content of ore  metals itself, but the hydrothermal solutions derived from it will tend  to concentrate the ore metals, so that the ore bodies that are finally  deposited in the volcanic rocks may have such a high proportion of  useful metals that they are economically workable. 

700237
We must discuss it. 
The party should not <tag>derive</> its authority from a paragraph of text; it must prove it every day."

Sir: 
C. E. Cassell (letter, 1 December) suggests that Mrs Thatcher's saying `I am what I am" may <tag>derive</> from god-like pretensions. 

700239
So an ignimbrite can be likened to a sort of continually-expanding rock  froth which floods out of a vent. 
The fragments of pumice which make up  the magmatic component of the ignimbrite are themselves solid, but the  copious volumes of gas that are continually exsolved from the pumice  fragments mobilize the whole into a cloud of low density and viscosity,  which travels over the ground surface at high speed and spreads over a  great area. 
So the mechanism of travel is like that of a nuee ardente, except that  in some nuees the gas that cushions the flow may be air entrapped by the  onrushing mass of debris, while in an ignimbrite the gas is <tag>derived</> from  within the flow itself.   

700240
The stations were to be vast in size but unexciting in form. 
The first Sealdah station of 1862 <tag>derived</> its prime grandeur from its engineering works: a six-mile embankment had to be built to bring the railway into the centre of Calcutta.
