Right, no, I think there's definitely some work that needs to be done on the attitude of women. 
I mean I mentioned earlier the fact that it might be that people perceive sexual harassment, where in fact the <tag>behaviour</> has been perfectly appropriate and it's just that the person perceiving it is unused to it, but I think that's the minority of cases, incidentally.

Firstly, a child's personality and behaviour changes little in the pre-school years. 
For instance, difficult toddlers were found to have more behavioural problems when they went to primary school; unsociable toddlers were found to have poor social skills later and had difficulty in adjusting to school; and toddlers with good language development showed above-average ability in language at the age of six. 
It also seems that the mothers involved were usually very good judges of their own child's character, and were often able to make accurate predictions concerning future <tag>behaviour</>.

Mynes admitted assaulting Mr Gary Naylor on July 29 last year. 
He also pleaded guilty to assaulting MoD PC Michael Goodwin and using threatening behaviour within the sight and hearing of PC Goodwin at RAF Upper Heyford on August 12 last year. 
Mynes pleaded guilty to using disorderly <tag>behaviour</> within the hearing and sight of WPC Alison Kennett on September 24 last year.

Only if the social costs of such a strategy, in terms of mental illness, vandalism, etc., were deemed to be high enough, might it be economically efficient to subsidise firms to take on such labour. 
Despite these various arguments suggesting high unemployment from rapid technical change which are based on the foundation laid by him, Leontief has himself, with a colleague (Leontief and Duchin 1983), recently published the results of a survey of the likely effects of new technology on the US economy up to the year 2000 which concludes that, far from there being net job losses, there will be a substantial rise in the aggregate labour force over this period due to the rapid take-up of the technology. 
Another major theoretical objection to compensation theory concerns the investment <tag>behaviour</> of firms.

The Secretary of State said that despite repeated and specific assurances from Moscow of a cut-off, the arms were still flowing from Cuba and Nicaragua to the rebels in El Salvador. 
`It appears that old thinking, or old <tag>behaviour</> more appropriate to Brezhnev than Gorbachev guide Soviet policy toward some important regional conflicts," he said.

I haven't spoken to anybody who wouldn't say that there is a problem with drunkenness and I mean this is very, very common <tag>behaviour</> and it's alcohol related behaviour.

Not only would it be more pleasant but it might be more productive. 
Many of the things that are most wrong with British working attitudes are rooted in the mores of establishment cliques: the deviousness and duplicity of boys schools' codes of <tag>behaviour</>.

The Hibs supporters stayed on for more than 30 minutes after the final whistle. 
Their exemplary <tag>behaviour</>, which was praised by the Belgian police, was rewarded when the track-suited Hibs players trotted out to wave a final farewell.   

700011
The association of skins and blacks in a common form of music had come to an end. 
At a time when middle class hippies, flower power, student mysticism and love-ins were getting the attention of the media, the working class youths of the skinhead movement adopted an aggressive form of <tag>behaviour</>, in keeping with the tough uniforms of their boots and braces.  

700012
Their true love affairs were with the camera and with those flickering images of themselves which turned on the rest of the public as well. 
Their lack of involvement on any deep level with men was, in its way, a liberation and perhaps explains why so many women, too, admired them, copied their looks and envied their freedom of <tag>behaviour</>.   

700013
Rees-Mogg `proved" the point by showing that during 1965-73 the growth of M3 (in excess of output growth) averaged 9.4 per cent per annum, exactly equal to the average inflation rate two years later, that is between 1967 and 1975. 
But a similar comparison for the early Thatcher years shows that, whereas the average rate of growth of M3 (in excess of output growth) was about 14 per cent in the four years ending 1983, the average inflation rate was only about 6 per cent in the four years ending 1985. 
While the monetary targets were exceeded, the deceleration of inflation was far greater than can be accounted for by the <tag>behaviour</> of M3 and must have another cause.

Thailand is an ideal place for the virus to spread.

However, the cynicism and poor morale portrayed in Platoon are more typical of post-1968 attitudes after the Tet Offensive, rather than 1967 when the film was set. 
Stone also came dangerously close to giving the false impression that the GIs' <tag>behaviour</> in the film was typical.   

700017
Down through history, `knights of the realm" have lost their titles for much less than collaboration in the overthrow of a legitimate government. 
It seems that just as Queen Elizabeth has chosen to ignore the plight of commoner Timoci Bavadra, equally she is ignoring the <tag>behaviour</> of those of her knights in Fiji who are now pandering to the dictates of an unelected military strongman.

In October, at the annual party Conference, Harold Wilson unsuccessfully challenged Hugh Gaitskell for the leadership of the party.

`Plymouth, 5th July 1825. 
This is to certify that Color Serjeant Nicholl served in the Grenadier Company of the King's Regiment for twenty one years, and being myself one of the Officers of the Company during the greatest part of that period, I have consequently had an opportunity for closely observing his character and conduct, therefore it is but doing him that justice which his uniformly good <tag>behaviour</> merits, to state that I have never (in his station in life) met with a more truly steady or strictly honest a man.

Trinidadians, more than any other West Indian nation, love to `party", and the match has become an excuse for a second Carnival. 
It is already `Winners" Week' and security forces are preparing for a night of frenzy if the steel bands come out to celebrate. 
Thirty thousand tickets were sold in an hour, and printing presses have apparently been smuggled in from Miami, prompting the authorities to call for `common sense and good <tag>behaviour</>".

This makes it more difficult for the client's `adult" self to emerge and start to exert some control over his or her life. 
At Blagdon, staff are trying to communicate with the adult aspects of their clients, so that after decades of using self-destructive or child-like <tag>behaviour</> to manipulate their `parent" figures, they finally learn how to ask in a mature way for the help they need.

I would have trusted him to be here at this discussion and say much the same things other people here would be saying. 
I mean I think I'd like to comment on the way some of the discussion was going earlier, because although it's true that it's largely men who are seen as creating the problem, there are certainly large numbers of men in positions of authority in the university who are very concerned about it, and who have been led to re-examine their own <tag>behaviour</>, and who now comment on how uncomfortable and constrained they themselves feel. 

700024
In the early sixties, the teddy boys were succeeded by the mods, and their counterparts the rockers. 
Skinheads could be identified as a separate group in 1968 because of their distinctive dress and appearance, the type of music which they liked and the tough, aggressive <tag>behaviour</> which they displayed.

They fall into several major categories. 
Obviously, there's the area of aggression, which can be split into various sub-sections; fear aggression, dominance aggression, territorial <tag>behaviour</>, livestock chasing, aggression towards other dogs.

As many as to 50 per cent of patients operated on for lung cancer start smoking again within a year, and 38 per cent of smokers who have heart attacks resume smoking in hospital, Dr Michael Russell, honorary director of the Health <tag>Behaviour</> Unit at the Institute of Psychiatry London, told a symposium on nicotine addiction.

Today, her party 10 points behind in the polls, her own approval ratings lagging behind her opponent's, Labour for the first time feels confident enough to play the woman. 
It did so yesterday, at Question Time on her <tag>behaviour</> at the Commonwealth conference, in the economic debate which followed making capital out of the differences between Numbers 10 and 11 Downing Street over exchange rate policy.

As with Farquhar's Mrs Sullen in The Beaux Stratagem, these comedies suggest that women's desires must at least be accommodated. 
That aspect of comedy which deals in correction has the women adjust male <tag>behaviour</>, and that aspect which is wishful thinking would have the audience believe that they will then live happily ever after.

This is compatible with widespread incommensurability. 
While the agent's reasoning figures in many explanations of <tag>behaviour</> there are other factors which also play a part.

Yes, I wanted to make a point on the disciplinary side, which is as senior proctor the side of things I find myself thinking most about, and this is going back to the question of policing and whether it's appropriate to talk in those terms. 
I'm quite keen to make a distinction between what you might call victimless crimes and crimes with victims, and that it is, it seems to me, we want to move away from an older pattern in which the university had its ideas of how people should behave and tried to make them conform to those ideas, towards a much more complaint activated system of response, so that it's the kind of <tag>behaviour</> find objectionable that the authorities may get drawn into looking at.

It is the first time professional clubs have been held responsible for employees' conduct in this way. 
Apart from having to answer a charge of bringing the game into disrepute, Arsenal and Norwich must defend themselves under the FA's rule 24 (i) (a), which is generally applied in cases of hooliganism by spectators but states that players and officials, too, must `refrain from violent, threatening, abusive, obscene or provocative <tag>behaviour</>".

Ethnic minorities, according to Marie Staunton, head of the organisation's British section, are treated as `less equal" than other people and as a result their rights and their lives are seen as `more expendable."

But of course I wasn't. 
Like every other young person born circa 1952 I saw, over the following decades, a steady casting away of most of the economic, religious and social pressures against separation that had induced my Auntie Marjorie and so many of her generation to make a go of their marriages, despite their incompatibilities, and to rationalise this as staying together for the sake of the children. 
We have our own set of rationalisations for our <tag>behaviour</> now.

Some horses indulge in this self-orientated activity by biting their own sides or legs, even to the extent of tearing their own flesh so that they bleed. 
Other repetitive abnormal <tag>behaviour</> exhibited by deprived horses includes swinging the head and neck up and down, or from side to side, and the extension of this habit into the stable vice of weaving.

Jane Goodall's findings have helped to transform conventional scientific thinking about animals &dash. which, of course, is used to rationalise how they are treated. 
When she started publishing her work, animal behaviour research was dominated by theorists who contended more or less literally that to find out how a creature worked, you took it to bits. 
I have good reason to remember a booklength early monograph of hers, published in the British journal of Animal <tag>Behaviour</>: it was almost the first text I ever read as an apprentice sub-editor.

Each user should normally bear the costs of the information services provided  Costs charged to users should generally be based on long-term marginal costs &dash. that is, they should exclude costs that will not change significantly over any plausible range of activity, such as the cost of the core management team for the data center  A small portion of the total central MIS budget &dash. in the range of perhaps 5 to 10% &dash. should be made available for innovative and possibly risky projects that no user department is willing to fund completely on its own  Revenue received from users by the data center should become discretionary `revolving" funds available to support the operation without further budgetary approva  Costs not controlled through user charges &dash. that is, the fixed cost component of the data center budget plus centrally-funded exploratory projects &dash. should be controlled directly at the corporate level  Standard rates, rather than `actual" (retrospective) costs, should be used as the basis for charging users; these rates should be based on expected volumes and an acceptable level of efficiency over the forthcoming accounting period (a year, say)  Any variance at the end of the accounting period should normally be absorbed at the data center level, with due management attention paid to the source of 
the variance  Variances stemming from multiperiod effects (e.g., start-up of a new computer having excess initial capacity) can be carried over to the following period in setting the new rates  Users should be charged for any resource dedicated to their specific use (such as a disk drive devoted solely to a nonshared database); multiyear contracts with users of such resources often make particularly good sense  Unbundle charges &dash. providing a separate `a la carte" price for each individual resource &dash. so that users pay for the services they actually consume rather than on the basis of an average mix of resources  Use price differentials to motivate desirable user <tag>behavior</> (such as discounting nighttime prices to shift work to a time when idle capacity is available)  Employ output-related charges when a reasonably standard measure of output exists (e.g., number of credit accounts maintained or invoices issued) rather than input-related charges (e.g., CPU seconds, input/output volume)  Charge fixed prices for services that have a relatively small (or predictable) demand for resources, such as a fixed monthly price for dedicated workstation and electronic mail services  Use a fixed-price contract for each stage of a software development project, possibly with a fixed upper limit on the project as a whole  For large development

For, besides the materialist qualities, the spiritual quality of commitment and feeling is as present between homosexual as between heterosexual partners. 
Equally, I am prepared to advocate that, in historical terms, the time has arrived, in the absence of other viable legal institutions, to forsake the requirement of bisexuality and thus abandon the negative definitive criterion of homosexuality, if indeed it is such a criterion. 
Another argument I must meet is that while it is one thing to tolerate <tag>behaviour</> and remove criminal sanctions, in this case concerning homosexual activities, it is quite another thing to facilitate and give recognition to unions built on such activities.

The presidents of seven Latin American contries (Peru, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia and Mexico) gather on Wednesday in Ica, an oasis in the desert south of Lima, for two days of talks focusing on the foreign debt and drug trafficking. 
Panama's President Francisco Rodriguez should have been there, too (it is a Group of Eight meeting, after all), but his country is in the doghouse because of the controversial <tag>behaviour</> of his boss, General Manuel Noriega.

Put shortly, they urge that sexuality is a combination of sex and gender.

WHILE a hail of insults bore down upon Margaret Thatcher yesterday in her latest skirmish with fellow Commonwealth leaders, the Speaker of the Commons, for one, was quick to defend her honour. 
Bernard Weatherill upset some Labour MPs by ruling that whatever disparaging remarks were being made about the Prime Minister elsewhere, she could not be accused in the House of `deceitful" <tag>behaviour</>.

Pulling was associated with expectation of speed: if his expectation of speed was reduced, so was the pulling.

Clearly the most ghastly image is that of the badger, at bay in its subterranean home. 
Some fear lurks within; butchery in tunnels &dash. a nightmare terror of entrapment, claustrophobia, premature burial, which, at the same time, evokes a contradictory appeal of the underground as a womb-like refuge or a clandestine network of opportunities for proscribed <tag>behaviour</>.

Wilander lost the tie-break after having had set point at 6-5 and, having won the second set from 1-2, lost the last two after leading in each by 2-0.

Moreover, the influence of genes upon stone properties seems especially indirect.

Furthermore, not all perfectionist action is a coercive imposition of a style of life. 
Much of it could be encouraging and facilitating action of the desired kind, or discouraging undesired modes of <tag>behaviour</>.

I think, though, what's very important in that as well is that I know that there are young men in the colleges who are really ashamed of the sort of picture that's increasingly being presented. 
Whether that shame is yet moving them to have an impact on the men who they see perpetrating this sort of <tag>behaviour</> in colleges I don't know, but certainly some of the undergraduates I have spoken to feel very embarrassed that this is the portrait of male behaviour that's being perpetrated.

Tydeus sets the tone of violence, defiance, and animality, which threatens the city. 
This is elaborated in the next five attackers and negated in the defenders, and above all in Amphiaraus. 
In Capaneus, Eteoclus, Hippomedon, Parthenopaeus, these qualities are conveyed not only by words, appearance, <tag>behavior</>, but by the shield devices which grow progressively more threatening &dash. a naked man carrying a torch and shouting `I shall burn the city," a hoplite carrying a ladder with which to scale the walls, Typhon wreathed in snakes and breathing smoke, the man-eating sphinx with a dead Theban in her claws.

Whether a woman succeeds in her struggle to integrate different roles is determined by her relationship with him.

It is hardly reasonable to reproach him with his coldness to his wife; it seems clear that rumours of what is going on at home have found their way to him. 
Nor is his <tag>behaviour</> at any point undignified; here we must contrast him with Aegisthus, whom the poet has portrayed in a most unsympathetic fashion.

Typically a person is tolerant if and only if he suppresses a desire to cause to another a harm or hurt which he thinks the other deserves. 
The clearest case of toleration, whether justified or not, is where a person restrains his indignation at the sight of injustice or some other moral evil, or rather at the sight of <tag>behaviour</> which he takes to be of this character.

It is grounded in the employer's right to instruct his employees. 
But it is a conditional duty, i.e. a duty (in matters connected with one's employment) to perform an action if instructed by the employer to do so. 
When the condition which activates the duty is an action of some person, and when the duty is conditional on it because it is in the right-holder's interest to make that person able to activate the duty at will, then the right confers a power on the person on whose <tag>behaviour</> the duty depends.

Asked whether Mr Honecker now felt that his life's work had been destroyed, Mr Krenz replied: `We didn't discuss that specifically, but I can imagine he might well."

It would be utterly wrong to comment at this stage on the actions of the individuals &dash. and corporations, for they are also charged &dash. in what has come to be known as the Blue Arrow affair.

The danger from our point of view is not only that these people are degrading hypnosis. 
`Their <tag>behaviour</> is such that some day some doctor or politician is going to bring in an Act of Parliament and they'll have a bloody good case for stopping stage hypnotism for good."

I am not going to trot out the catalogue, but will mention just a few suggestions. 
In the course of this I shall return to the remaining examples of apparently altruistic <tag>behaviour</> that I gave in Chapter 1, and which I promised to explain.

On the same page appeared a sharp rebuke to Ken Brown, an idiosyncratic professional golfer, who had committed the unforgivable sin of refusing to give interviews to the press or television and making good his escape from a crowd of journalists by vaulting over a barrier. 
`We view Brown's <tag>behaviour</> very seriously," said the presiding official, `he is doing a disservice to the PGA [Professional Golfers' Association] and to everyone concerned with the game."

Speakers will be Dr James Serpell who will talk about the relationship between dogs and people, and Dr John Bradshaw who will discuss the communication which takes place between dogs. 
Other topics will feature the development of individuality in dogs, discussed by Dr Helen Nott, and Dr Roger Mugford, the animal psychologist, will be talking about <tag>behaviour</> therapy for problem dogs.

Much of the interest that people have in goals of these kinds is available to them because of the existence of suitable social forms. 
These comments explain why I prefer the phrase `social forms" to the more familiar ones, such as `social practices" or `conventions". 
These appear to be concerned exclusively with <tag>behaviour</>, and attitudes to behaviour.

Today the theatre of war is Rover, and Smith looks like a man on the defensive again. 
He is unlikely to use such vivid language next month, when he appears before the Commons Trade and Industry Select Committee to give evidence on his role in the take-over of the car company by British Aerospace, of which he is chairman, but his recent uncharacteristic <tag>behaviour</> suggests that he might dearly like to.

And without being alarmist, most of us would like to know more about the effect of years of chemical bombardment on our bodies. 
It's not so long since we learned the link between eating certain `E" numbers and the <tag>behaviour</> of highly disruptive children.

I hasten to say that this artistic failure should not deter anybody from reading Nyiri's novel. 
It is a forceful study of human <tag>behaviour</> under inhuman stress, and also offers clues for understanding some of the stormy developments in present-day Hungary.

VIRGO (Aug 24-Sept 23): You've a sensitive, intuitive insight into the motivations and emotions of others that helps you understand a partner's grouchy grumbles or a colleague's tetchiness.

The significance of a thousand tiny clues of what is known as body language contribute, indeed are often essential, to the success of the developing relationship. 
All these are derived from the common culture, from the shared social forms, and though they receive the individual stamp of each person, their foundation in shared social forms is continuing and lasting. 
Just as the eye continues to guide the hand all the way to its target, and is not limited to determining its original trajectory, so our continued awareness of the common culture continuously nourishes and directs our <tag>behaviour</> in pursuit of our goals.

It makes at the same time a characteristic noise that sounds like a burp. 
The wind-sucker is similar to the crib-biter, but manages to swallow air without latching on to any object so the teeth do not suffer abnormal and excessive wear. 
It has been reported that isolation-reared laboratory animals show abnormal <tag>behaviour</> towards painful sensory stimulation, such as a burning match or pin-prick.

FIVE months after beating up Frank Bruno, the world heavyweight champion defends his title again on Saturday. 
It is doubtful that Mike Tyson's latest opponent, a 29-year-old former sparring partner, Carl `The Truth" Williams, will be the man to wrench the scarily powerful grip the young man has on his championship belt. 
Indeed, you fancy that the one person in the forseeable future who might have the beating of Tyson is the champion himself &dash. when his spectacular and continuing anti-social <tag>behaviour</> outside the ring finally outpaces the ability of his `connections" to cover up.   

700100
These reservations are shared by experts in other countries, particularly in West Germany. 
Our problem, however, is that Mrs Thatcher's <tag>behaviour</> has left the United Kingdom without friends, and we are powerless to influence the debate.

Sometimes forks would appear on the right and knives on the left, sometimes (Henry always felt this was Maisie's way of telling people they were not welcome) two knives or only a spoon.

He had taken the precaution of sinking some stones and gravel at the foot of the ramp in case the bell should catch on the edge of the ramp where it ended under the level of the ooze. 
The danger at this point, apart from the unpredictability of the bell's <tag>behaviour</>, was that the sound of the tractor might be heard; but Toby judged that, with the south-west wind blowing as it had now been for some time, the noise was not likely to be audible at the Court, or if heard would not be recognisable.

Some of the Government's natural supporters, notably those in the CBI, question the conventional wisdom. 
The <tag>behaviour</> of exports since 1986 in response to changes in the exchange rate against the mark supports their case.

I would say a combination of physical complicity and emotional rivalry. 
The sense of a molten family relationship is instantly visible in the way Olga lazily passes her cigarette to the reading Masha or the manner in which Irina tugs at Masha's skirt, as if telling her to be on her best <tag>behaviour</>, when she comments on Vershinin's age.   

700105
She had been left in the care of her mother, Thelma Lewis, who was later found to be a chronic schizophrenic. 
Mrs Lewis's increasingly bizarre and sometimes violent <tag>behaviour</> over a 15-year period had driven Beverley's five able-bodied brothers and sisters from the family home in Stanley Road, Gloucester.

Another columnist's wheeze is the public announcement of one's New Year resolutions. 
Having been in academic life for so long, I still calculate my new years from October. 
For me, the cycle starts with the autumn term and any revolutionary transformations I am inclined to make in my <tag>behaviour</> come at the end of the summer holiday, which still feels like the beginning of a working year.

Two other people in the car were unhurt. 
ARGENTINA'S footballers received a tumultuous welcome yesterday on their return home after finishing runners-up in the World Cup in Italy. 
The team, bitterly criticised in the European press for their <tag>behaviour</> and negative tactics, were hailed as heroes as Argentina turned its fury on the Mexican who refereed the final.   

700108
This has prompted taunts from the British and American press about the unwillingness of European countries to shoulder their responsibilities. 
Indeed, in Britain, the short-lived post-Thatcher pro-Europeanism has been dissipated in a wave of Atlanticism and jingoism &dash. talk of political union now seems to be off the agenda. 
But in other west European countries a different conclusion is being drawn, namely that European political union, perhaps excluding Britain, is all the more important so as to provide a check on American <tag>behaviour</>, to avoid a unipolar world.

A bitter cup of coffee, a rude salesgirl, a failed attempt to get the right ingredients for a vegetable lasagna, are the the signposts of the day, and they are massive. 
The coffee cup is a round white lake, the salesgirl's laughter echoes for miles and for hours, the inadequate lasagna will fall like a ravaged sierra. 
Perspective telescopes: with my nasty coffee, I read a report on race riots in my native city, where family and friends remain, as if it were recounting the <tag>behaviour</> of black and white mice in cramped and stressful lab conditions.

Remember Reagan? 
Anyway, Gene Autry, ever steadfast in his former Hollywood life as a straight-shooting, crooning cowboy, did exhibit curious <tag>behaviour</> even in his screen roles.

It had been my intention to seek out a further interview with Mr Cardinal with minimum delay, but this proved to be impossible, owing largely to the arrival that same afternoon &dash. some two days earlier than expected &dash. of Mr Lewis, the American senator. 
I had been down in my pantry working through the supplies sheets, when I had heard somewhere above my head the unmistakable sounds of motor cars pulling up in the courtyard. 
As I hastened to go upstairs, I happened to encounter Miss Kenton in the back corridor &dash. the scene, of course, of our last disagreement &dash. and it was perhaps this unhappy coincidence that encouraged her to maintain the childish <tag>behaviour</> she had adopted on that previous occasion.

Nothing is gained and nothing is lost during the redistribution. 
The conservation of energy leads to a need for symmetry of <tag>behaviour</> &dash. any positive action shall permit an equal and opposite negative action; left hand spin is balanced by right hand spin; matter requires anti-matter; mirror imagery, requiring a fulcrum, a fold or neutral is necessary to the equilibrium of the system.

No one, however, really expects the deal to fail. 
We are within an ace of the end of one of the least glamorous but most important financial scandals of our age. 
NOT UNLIKE rampaging football hooligans, a small minority of local authorities have managed, through their irresponsible <tag>behaviour</> in the swaps market to create havoc for the peace-loving majority.

The Stamford Bridge regime was annoyed by Joe Lovejoy's report of racism there in The Independent. 
But corroboration has now been given to Chelsea by a supporter who suggests `those in charge" spend match days amid the bad <tag>behaviour</> that should be confronted, `instead of attempting to denigrate responsible journalists".

It would have been much easier still for me to fail back on the shoddy old device of arranging for my fictional character to be a writer of fiction himself: in truth, this mirror-like method (for all its previous misuses) lends itself excellently to some of the central concepts with which I originally embarked upon this present journey. 
But Miller is, to me, such a sick and weak creature, perpetually trying to blame others for his own foul <tag>behaviour</> and mental inadequacies, that I feared he would be left without any redeeming features whatsoever.

The UK is behind the US, France and West Germany in cars owned per head of the population. 
The Government is right to resist the vociferous anti-road lobby and to pay heed to what people show they want by their <tag>behaviour</> and not by what paternalists say they should want.

`Let her get away with more impossible <tag>behaviour</> and talk much more rubbish, you mean.   

700121
Well, perhaps I can say &ellip. pick up on a couple of points in the discussion. 
First of all it's true that the term sexual harassment is used to cover an extraordinarily wide range of forms of behaviour, from behaviour that makes people mildly uncomfortable, to quite violent forms of aggression, and this can be a problem and confuse discussion. 
Two people who think they are disagreeing may, in fact, be talking about different things and wouldn't disagree if they were talking about the same thing, but it's important to recognise that when the university and colleges talk about what they want to do about sexual harassment, they certainly imagine that a range of different forms of response are going to be appropriate to this range of different forms of <tag>behaviour</>, ranging from on the one hand education, encouraging people to think they have a right to protest and answer back, to giving them access to {vocal sound="um"} people who may mediate and persuade another person who they're not making an impact on that their behaviour is unreasonable, to the most extreme disciplinary procedures against someone who's behaving in a way which is generally thought to be unacceptable and who's not prepared to desist.   

700122
The brawl that took place shortly before the final whistle involved a majority of the players of both Arsenal and Norwich, and some could have had no complaints had their collars been felt by the constabulary for conduct that demonstrably breached the peace: at least two Arsenal supporters leapt from the terraces to join the argument. 
Extraordinarily, the referee, George Tyson, took no action. 
More predictably, the managers, who have at least a moral responsibility for the <tag>behaviour</> of their teams, declined to discuss it afterwards, George Graham skirting the subject altogether and David Stringer merely alluding to an explanation with implied criticism of two penalty decisions in Arsenal's favour.   

700123
It has attracted not only widespread condemnation but a fair amount of sociological analysis as well with the result that there is a lively debate taking place about its origins and nature. 
Of particular interest to the historian is the question of continuity or discontinuity in this kind of behaviour. 
Did the 1960s see a sharp break in the form and content of the collective <tag>behaviour</> of young working-class spectators?   

700124
Not only did he believe in morbid heredity, hysteria passed on through the female line from generation to generation, he also believed in dissociating hysteria from sexuality and desire. 
His dream of identifying the precise location in the cerebral cortex of the inherited lesions that cause hysterical <tag>behavior</> was motivated by an imaginary equation of woman with pathology, pathology that, Charcot argued after Briquet, can also be found in male brains.

Her mentally ill mother, Thelma Lewis, was wandering in the road outside. 
Miss Lewis died, weighing only three stones and 13lbs, from pneumonia due to emaciation and a brain disability. 
Clive Lewis told the inquest that, in 1982, he was so worried about his mother's strange <tag>behaviour</> and deteriorating conditions in the house that he contacted the Citizens Advice Bureau.

The Corrado's chassis is first class, but watch it attacking a series of bends and it's hard to understand why. 
It seems incomprehensible that a chassis with such a marked front weight-bias  and an inside-rear tyre that can jump six inches clear of the ground can also provide such superlative <tag>behaviour</>.

The councils had effectively agreed to a ministerial veto in sensitive areas including `matters liable significantly to involve ministers including highly contentious and politically sensitive matters of moment".

A group of 36 children of Asian, West Indian or mixed parentage, placed with white families, was identified in a study by the British Agencies for Fostering and Research, and followed up at various stages. 
Most had no significant signs of disturbed <tag>behaviour</>, and were average or above-average at school.

If  two magmas have identical viscosities, it's the one with the highest gas  content that's erupted most violently. 
In the case of the 1971 Etna eruption, the magma involved was the same  basaltic one throughout, yet its <tag>behaviour</> was quite different in its  de-gassed condition in the second phase from its original state in the  first, when the eruption was mildly explosive.

While the Sports Minister recognised that the overwhelming majority of English supporters in Italy had behaved well during the World Cup he said there was still a tiny minority intent on hooliganism and continuing to cause trouble. 
A report is to be sent to Uefa detailing the <tag>behaviour</> of English fans not only during the World Cup but also throughout the 1989/90 football season before any decision is made on whether English teams should be allowed back into European competitions.

THE POUND came under heavy pressure again yesterday and sterling interest rates slipped as markets oscillated with bewildering speed, leaving traders uncertain as to whether the events of the past four days had helped or hindered the Government's struggle to contain inflation. 
There was no evidence of a significant easing of policy by the authorities in Europe or the US and markets were left with the feeling in Europe that closing prices were insufficiently changed from Friday to warrant an easing of liquidity today unless another collapse occurs. 
At the same time, markets took little notice of official injunctions to good <tag>behaviour</>.   

700143
But through television it projects the image of national football round the world. 
After the appalling damage done to England's footballing reputation by the <tag>behaviour</> of some of its fans in Europe, the performance of England's team last night was something to be proud of.   

700144
The clubs must answer not only the familiar catch-all charge of bringing the game into disrepute, usually applied to players or managers, but also an accusation that they broke the FA's rule 24, which generally applies to cases of hooliganism by spectators. 
It states that `players, officials &ellip. and all persons purporting to be supporters or followers must conduct themselves in an orderly fashion and refrain from violent, threatening, abusive, obscene or provocative <tag>behaviour</>".

This might be the prelude to any adapted stage play, a stimulating montage before the proscenium arch is fitted over the screen. 
But, although most of the rest of the film, until its chase finale, is played out within one house, where the lodger's strange <tag>behaviour</> arouses suspicions of his guilt, Hitchcock's interest in using the details of daily life to build anticipation and stir emotion ensures that the action never seems confined. 

700146
Lennart Johannson, the UEFA president, welcomed back English clubs on a trial period at the congress meeting in Geneva this morning. 
It followed the British Government's approval for ending the exile, which has lasted since the riot at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels in 1985, when 39 people died. 
The relative good <tag>behaviour</> of English fans at the World Cup in Italy played a prominent part in the UEFA decision.

Only in the later decades of the nineteenth century in multi-storey manufacturing and storage buildings which were required to resist very heavy loads did concrete slab or masonry jack-arched floors become common. 
The majority of constructions which survive from ancient times are of stone and because of this it is easy to overlook the equivalent tradition of timber construction. 
The use of timber in buildings has been a continuous process reflecting its availability, the relative costs of material and labour, developments in processing and distribution, and the growth in understanding of its structural <tag>behaviour</> and the problems of rot, insect attack and fire.

They tend to feel they have been blamed for the way they brought the child up.

Queen Victoria did not believe in the existence of lesbianism, and Victorian ladies were able to live together without anyone questioning their sex lives. 
After Freud, we became more knowing and more inquisitive about adult sexual <tag>behaviour</>, and that's how we have to be about sex abuse. 

700152
Psychoanalysis, for example, was indeed associated with the bourgeoisie, since only they could afford it. 
Yet as Sartre and de Beauvoir acknowledged, this did not in itself invalidate its potential for widening our understanding of human nature and behaviour. 
It may have been fashionable, within vanguard circles, to `let go" and lose one's inhibitions, in defiance of conventional <tag>behaviour</>, but such things are easier said than done.

If you think there is anything outlandish about this, Nancy Reagan will set you right. 
After all, if the rising of the sun and the waxing of the moon have such a profound effect on human <tag>behaviour</>, why shouldn't the whereabouts of Pluto matter, too?

It is dangerous enough to express doubts about Mrs Thatcher's suitability for the leadership of the Conservative Party nowadays. 
But in the war, at least, the Peace Pledge Union was allowed to continue its activities, urging a negotiated peace with Hitler and seeking converts to its cause, subject to minor harassment from the security services and occasional imprisonment for <tag>behaviour</> likely to cause a breach of the peace.

In these years business was as brisk as ever in the premises of Edward Shaw, {deadGuys}, but the situation at Plas Wilmot was less happy. 
While Susan Shaw delighted her parents with her painting, her needlework, her accomplished playing of harp and piano, and the general <tag>behaviour</> expected of a dutiful daughter, her brother Edward was beginning to give cause for concern.

She is the widow of a life peer but is referred to throughout as `Lady Julie" &dash. the author indulging here in a little Pom-teasing. 
Lady Julie observes, as Darcy has been observing with increasing awe, the extraordinarily civilised <tag>behaviour</> of the Eritreans; their exemplary treatment of prisoners (`We will insult you with our compassion"); their well-organised aid programmes; their balanced egalitarianism and their passion for educating their children even under the most appallingly adverse conditions.   

700161
Most pervasively it has stimulated the search for `deep pockets" on behalf of claimants victimized by tortfeasors without assets. 
The high percentage of un- or under-insured tortfeasors, even in motor-car accidents, ensures that the accident cost is in practice often met by defendants, such as municipal authorities responsible for street maintenance, whose share of fault may be negligible. 
In addition, it has encouraged a vast extension of `duties of affirmative action" so as to impose responsibility on individuals and entities for mere omissions to prevent the risk of accident-prone <tag>behaviour</> by others; hence the liability visited on owners of commercial and residential premises for robberies and rapes, for failures by public officials, insurance agents, and the like to inspect the work performed by others, for the ubiquitous failures to warn consumers against misuse of products and an unimaginable array of dangers. 

700162
A Home Office spokesman said banks knew which accounts were in question. 
General Maxwell Thurman, head of the US southern command and the de facto military governor of Panama, has been living up to his twin nicknames of `Mad Max" and `the Maxatollah". 
Military commentators in Washington, Panamanian officials and even some US officials in Panama City are disturbed by General Thurman's high-handed <tag>behaviour</> since the US invasion, and his increasingly eccentric handling of the Vatican Nunciature `siege".

For ants, matricide is an act of special genetic madness and formidable indeed must be the drug that drives them to it. 
In the world of the extended phenotype, ask not how an animal's <tag>behaviour</> benefits its genes; ask inst ad whose genes it is benefiting.

She was trapped in Cambridge until the morning. 
The hours gaped in front of her and she found herself running downstairs and darting from room to room as if trying to find a gap through which to escape the black despair ahead. 
All the time her higher consciousness, a bitter, rational voice in the top of her head, observed that her <tag>behaviour</> was crazy.

Our interest is in political theories that require neutrality, i.e., that are followed by acting neutrally in a principled way. 
Some theories may be such that <tag>behaviour</> that follows them is also neutral as a by-product.  

700166
Andrei Sakharov could not accurately be described as a `political animal". 
His approach was unideological, both rational and intuitive and, above all, free of cant to the point of political tactlessness. 
While visiting Canada after the Congress, he made some critical remarks about the Soviet Army's <tag>behaviour</> in Afghanistan which not only did not endear him to many of his fellow citizens, but also disappointed many reform-minded intellectuals who felt he had allowed his moral outrage to overcome his political common sense.

This was classic Vulcanian activity. 
So, not counting the initial Strombolian activity in the North-East  Crater, there were three separate sites of activity during the course of  the eruption, and each showed different <tag>behaviour</>: Strombolian, Hawaiian  and Vulcanian.

But it is in making monotype illustrations in 1880 for his friend Ludovic Hale&acute.vy's book La Famille Cardinal that Degas most clearly shows his interest in the Ope&acute.ra coulisses and foyer as places of erotic commerce. 
Hale&acute.vy's story is a playful satire of the venal <tag>behavior</> of a backstage mother, a breed well known to contemporary chroniclers of the demimonde, who serves as managerial entremetteuse for her delightful daughters.

At least 1,000 people tried to get into the site by crossing the motorway. 
`At one stage over 100 officers were operating on the M25 to prevent accidents," the statement said.

Slowing down the process, as the Law Commission recommends, and getting couples talking to each other across a table, with a neutral mediator, could salvage some rocky unions. 
But the chances are small while the legal system continues to institutionalise the spouses" hostility and connive at laying the blame on one party, by allowing petitions based on intolerable <tag>behaviour</>.

Thirdly, following and extending Leontief's argument, we suggested that the maintenance of full employment may require some degree of job subsidisation by government, a weak version of the Leontief argument suggesting moderate levels of subsidy. 
A strong and extended version, which emphasises the high fixed costs of employing labour which do not arise when capital is substituted for labour, would suggest that the societal optimum might only be achieved if government in some instances subsidised jobs to a level beyond the costs of the individual's direct wage costs. 
Fourthly, the macro-economic argument about the instability of individual firms' investment <tag>behaviour</> was advanced.

Suddenly she caught sight of the child's mother. 
Immediately, her expression and pace of approach changed and instead of the lambasting, or worse, she had seemed about to deliver, she gave the child a tolerant smile and began to pick up the scattered cans. 
Most of us have experienced similar examples of such `audience effects" on <tag>behaviour</>: playing a game to perfection (or otherwise) when the team selector is present, for instance.

This was the paragraph where be had stopped. 
`But a distaste for gossip', he read, glinting with agreement, `should not be construed as a total reluctance to express the truth about another person's <tag>behaviour</> when no possible alternative exists as a way of defending myself.

I was absolutely horrified at the whole scene.

The indoor arena has a much quicker Supreme surface than the clay of Roland Garros, and it houses a crowd that can make Rome's Foro Italico seem like Eastbourne.

The simulacrum, to be effective, must not destroy biological process but rather exhibit it as that which has been denied, controlled, marked, like Des Esseintes's monstrous flowers, with the artist's stamp. {deadGuys}. comments Alain Buisine, {deadGuys}. 
This, of course, is precisely the strategy of the fetishist, and indeed one could argue that Huysmans's entire literary project is generated according to the formula Octave Mannoni considers typical of fetishistic <tag>behavior</>: {foreign language=French} (`I know perfectly well, but just the same").

When she died last February, aged 23, her five-foot frame weighed 3st 13lbs.

The wilder ones were rampant about blackmagic, the gruesome style of the mutilations, of kinky sex videos starring Polanski and his wife found at the house, and of the deep drug involvements of three of the victims. 
Once again, the fiction of Hollywood merged with fact; scenes of fantasy portrayed on celluloid for entertainment &dash. like those in Easy Rider had become, it was said, the acted-out realities of a group of people whose minds had been expanded to breaking point, until they performed deeds so indescribably vile that it barely seemed possible that one human being could inflict such wounds upon another for no apparent reason. 
Did Hollywood and the underground film-makers, in particular, hold any responsibility for such <tag>behaviour</>?

Even the Teddy Boy uniform, which was supposed to be a copy of smart Edwardian gentlemen's wear owed more to the look of Baddies in a Western &dash. especially the sideburns and the bootlace ties &dash. rather than the Knuts of the Gaiety Theatre stage door or the Empire promenade. 
There was nothing gentlemanly about their anti-social <tag>behaviour</>.

Drake seemingly had Nelson's initiative, panache, theatrical cockiness, without his skill in teamwork. 
Tactful, affable, generous with subordinates, he was clumsy with equals and brutal when crossed. 
He personally beheaded the gentlemanly Thomas Doughty for mutinous <tag>behaviour</> and excommunicated the ship's chaplain for mischief.

Robinson was perplexed by Childs's lavish turn on a wearing surface but he drove the seamers smoothly for 47 before he was caught at the wicket. 
Foster registered his fourth wicket, Jarvis's, and his second helmet, Pickles's, but the pitch, when on its best <tag>behaviour</>, lacked pace, and Essex must return today in search of a ninth championship win.

Then, when it is ridden in the  show ring, or it sees something possibly threatening, its anxiety peaks &dash. it promptly stands on its hind legs or pulls its tongue back over the bit. 
So not only the pain has to be removed to cure the habit; but also the fear of pain, and anxiety as well. 
Occasionally a horse starts some form of undesirable <tag>behaviour</>, such as putting its tongue over the bit, due to anxiety alone, and without it having been hurt; but we still have to cure the anxiety to prevent the unwanted  behaviour developing into a habit.   

700188
Aware that many East Germans have been deeply shocked and angered by violence against people arrested during demonstrations earlier this month, Mr Krenz said: `It is regrettable that in some demonstrations it came to blows &ellip. we should try through all forms of dialogue to ensure that it does not happen again." 
He promised that anyone who had been treated unjustly or humiliated could resort to law. 
The justice authorities would `conscientiously examine complaints and &dash. when there is proof &dash. punish wrongful <tag>behaviour</>".

How serious is the alcohol factor? 
Well I think personally I think it's a very serious problem, but it's something that we were talking earlier on and asking ourselves in what way, you know, the college or university authorities can set about policing undergraduate behaviour. 
I mean if one can use a slightly awkward word like `policing", and I think there is a sense that none of us want to be acting as substitute parents and, you know, policing student <tag>behaviour</> in a way that suggests that they're not yet fully mature. 

700191
To suggest a casual relationship, the approach needs to deviate, hesitate and show a certain sensitivity by inflection to minor incidents along the way and a disinterest in the awaiting subject. 
Its <tag>behaviour</> thus offers the subject ample opportunity to assess and accept the amiability of the approach.

The Hillsborough solicitors' group, which represents more than 180 firms acting on behalf of the Liverpool fans, announced in Liverpool yesterday that agreement had been reached with the South Yorkshire police and it was now unlikely that test cases due to be heard in the High Court next June would go ahead. 
Michael Humphries, a member of the steering group, said that the agreement was an admission by Peter Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, that his force was at fault in causing the disaster. 
`I think it will come as a relief to the city of Liverpool that, in doing this, any stories about the <tag>behaviour</> of Liverpool fans on the day must be seen in the light and the size of the payment that the police and their insurers are willing to make," he said.   

700195
Under General Accident's policy, for instance, the permanent disability benefit and the waiver of premium clause are excluded for those diagnosed as having the HIV virus. 
But Mr Johnson said there would be nothing to stop an HIV or Aids sufferer claiming under other parts of the policy if the illness involved some forms of cancer, the need for an organ transplant, or some other complaints. 
Many of the dread disease proposal forms do not include specific questions about sexual <tag>behaviour</>, although the standard inquiry now asked of life policy applicants about whether advice has ever been sought about Aids is included.   

700196
East End working class attitudes have been parodied by Alf Garnett as portrayed by Warren Mitchell, yet his strongly loyalist, anti-socialist, anti-foreigner, anti-intellectual, male chauvinist opinions appear to reflect real attitudes, only exaggerated for the purposes of the comedy. 
Some of these opinions can be seen reflected in the <tag>behaviour</> of skins, but the parallel should not be taken too far.

Italy says the reparation question was resolved by a settlement with King Idris, who was deposed by Colonel Gaddafi in 1969. 
BEIRUT &dash. General Michel Aoun last night accused Christian parliamentarians of `reckless <tag>behaviour</>" in agreeing to the Arab League's peace plan for Lebanon and warned them his Christian government would `use its powers" if they continued to support the accord, writes Robert Fisk.

In the meanwhile, two-party politics have resumed and Labour, for the first time since 1979, can no longer be ruled out as an alternative government. 
The chief causes of the Government's unpopularity are its economic performance and its policies, not Mrs Thatcher's style or <tag>behaviour</>.

As the miners lost their protection, commodity agreements lost much of their value. 
The present handful of commodity pacts has been reduced to its ineffective state partly by the <tag>behaviour</> of the ITC.

Continuing  damage to the moor also meant that conservationists had to act fast. 
In March 1982 the NCC sent all the farmers on West Sedgemoor a memorandum written in the language of an income-tax demand, which certainly gave support to the claim that conservationists might understand everything about the <tag>behaviour</> of  water beetles, but still had a lot to learn about ordinary human beings. 

700201
Mr Kay said his girlfriend referred to him in her police statement as `gentle, staid, thoughtful, polite, sexually perfectly normal and caring. 
`We know from his history and this offence that these are adjectives from which his <tag>behaviour</> departs on occasions."

Moreover, revival is impossible where the context of the original years has disappeared. 
Inevitably, revival means a new style, different dress, <tag>behaviour</>, attitudes and appearance from the beginnings of the skinhead cult.

The same applies to the brakes. 
In normal usage the Dodge stops acceptably, the spongy pedal and `grabbing" only occurring under duress, while the Vauxhall's brakes feel mushy but are stronger and more consistent in their <tag>behaviour</>.

Chris Mullin, Labour MP for Sunderland South who has campaigned on behalf of the Birmingham Six and wrote the book, Error of Judgement, will press the Home Secretary to look again at the case in the light of the Guildford affair.

So far this parallels Chandler, but, whereas Chandler focuses only on the volume of transactions as the determinant of relative efficiency, Williamson introduces wider considerations. 
In particular, he draws attention to a general attribute of human <tag>behaviour</>, that of opportunism. 

700208
`I have raised this issue because there is general concern about the high number of patients who take their own lives within a short time of being treated."

So far as Edward thought at all, he assumed, like many of his generation, that he could keep his private life entirely distinct from his public image. 
Also, like others of his generation, he exaggerated the decline in traditional standards of <tag>behaviour</>.

The Electronic Zoo has received praise and support from many quarters, including the pressure group Zoocheck, which would like all conventional zoos to be closed. 
Zoocheck cites the psychotic <tag>behaviour</> of some caged animals as well as small and badly designed cages in which they are kept, to support their argument. 

700211
Chair, can I suggest that some of the people who are actually involved in this are actually asked themselves rather than agencies that might be working with them, because I think that, that most of the, the sort of people we're talking about are actually very sensitive. 
And they know about what's happening to them, and know that at the end of the day, it doesn't matter about what their <tag>behaviour</> is, it doesn't matter about what happens to them, because nobody cares.   

700212
Will there be more use of peer-group, or clan-type, organisations? 
By extrapolating from present trends, but also from applying the theoretical knowledge we have about typical organisational <tag>behaviour</>, we can engage in some informed speculation.   

700213
Over the years, it became the standard public order offence. 
As amended in 1965, it covered any person who in any public place or at any public meeting used threatening, abusive, or insulting words or <tag>behaviour</> or distributed or displayed any writing, sign, or other visible representation which was threatening, abusive, or insulting.   

700214
It is effectively saying that the OFT will look kindly on anything where no one is kicking up a fuss. 
On past form, there is some empirical evidence to suggest that the OFT and Monopolies and Mergers Commission's <tag>behaviour</> has at least sometimes bolstered this view.

She was knocked down by the 17-year-old near her home in Wandsworth in 1986, and suffered `terrible agony" from the injury, the High Court in London heard. 
But the judge, Mr Justice Schiemann, decided the council, which was trying to teach the girl social <tag>behaviour</>, had not been negligent.

We've tried to abolish stigma. 
When you actually abolish these things, you can't expect <tag>behaviour</> to be totally unchanged.

In Wales there is a nationally agreed pupil profile; and many groups of schools or Local Authorities in England have been working on forms of profiling that would be objective and intelligible. 
In 1987 Neal Ascherson wrote an article in the Observer about `a document circulating in the Department of Education" which suggested a `quite new" way of assessing performance, not by examination results but by <tag>behaviour</>.

SUPERMARKETS, shopping centres and department stores across Brazil are bracing for a possible consumer spending binge this week, as Brazilians begin drawing their salaries. 
Consumer <tag>behaviour</> will be a crucial omen for the government's drastic anti-inflation policy. 

700220
That is a long while. 
There is no evidence of a boredom factor playing an important part in voting <tag>behaviour</>, but `time for a change" is the sort of cliche which springs to voters' lips when they sense it is time to throw one lot of rascals out.

A pity, then, that John Hall should spoil the show just when Bath had reasserted themselves in the league following last month's reversal against Gloucester at Kingsholm. 
Now Bath will have to be on their very best <tag>behaviour</>, let alone best form, if they are to have any chance of retaining the Courage title.   

700222
Why is it that people continue to follow dieting regimes that  do not work? 
They want to be slim of course, yet after months  or years of dieting failure you would think that it was time to  stop trying. 
There is something in this pattern of behaviour  that is very reminiscent of some addictive or compulsive  <tag>behaviours</>.   

700223
UNITED are considering putting in larger plates which will make opening the gates in their perimeter fence less easy and tempting to fans who want to invade the pitch, but still simple enough for supporters who genuinely need to open them in the event of an emergency. 
This follows the disturbing scenes last week when several hundred Leeds fans invaded the pitch after the final whistle. 
The <tag>behaviour</> of the Leeds fans generally was poor and a step back after so many supporters up and down the land have been striving hard to put on a more acceptable face to the rest of society. 

700224
But it would be a mistake to think that men were unaffected. 
In both Brighton and Newham, roughly one in four men avoided certain streets or areas. 
A recent Home Office study into how some kinds of male <tag>behaviour</> can make women feel uncomfortable or frightened discovered that many men shared a surprisingly large number of women's fears about violence and assault.

Cuckoo nestlings don't live inside robins or reed-warblers; they don't suck their blood or devour their tissues, yet we have no hesitation in labelling them as parasites. 
Cuckoo adaptations to manipulate the <tag>behaviour</> of foster-parents can be looked upon as extended phenotypic action at a distance by cuckoo genes.

These were the men who had run the war on the home front, and they provided the only alternative when established political figures were rejected. 
In practice, the new house soon settled down into traditional <tag>behaviour</>.

His influence was consequently much greater than his total of published work would suggest. 
The study of vortices such as those mentioned above was one of Maskell's great interests; after all, in the words of his famous colleague the late Dietrich Kuchemann, they are the `muscles and sinews" of aerodynamics. 
He had a profound understanding of their three-dimensional nature and <tag>behaviour</>, and with typical humour he once demonstrated the `vortex vulgaris" or bathtub vortex on an open day.   

700228
The so-called Keswick affair was something very different, and both Coleridge and Wordsworth had shown themselves to be on good terms with him long after that date. 
But the <tag>behavior</> of the rest of the scurrilous Tory pack had a political derivation.   

700229
It is not only the environment but also the animals and plants that inhabit it that display rhythms. 
This can be seen most clearly when considering their <tag>behaviour</>.   

700230
In fact, the CRC in Harrow (Northwick Park) is the major centre run by the Medical Research Council (MRC), where doctors and research scientists work together in planned groupings on important medical problems, such as schizophrenia. 
The underlying cause is the lack of a public, media or political constituency with a lively concern with education and science, although these are as essential for our national welfare as honest <tag>behaviour</>, rational thinking and human kindness.   

700231
This is what two players would each receive if they both consistently cooperated, scoring 3 points for each of the 200 rounds of the game. 
If one of them succumbed to the temptation to defect, it would very probably end up with fewer points than 600 because of retaliation by the other player (most of the submitted strategies had some kind of retaliatory <tag>behaviour</> built into them). 

700232
Smacking, says Leach, will not help the toddler's anger, frustration and fear, which create tantrums in the first place. 
But Burrows counters: `Children need the security of knowing they have a mother who is bigger and stronger than they are, who is in control." 
Child psychiatrist Dr John Pearce, author of a number of books about the role of parents, including the recently published Bad <tag>Behaviour</>, is one expert who tries to tread the middle ground.

Licensee Mr Allen Dearsley's `robust" reaction to the threats was described to Woodstock magistrates by Ms Cathy Olliver, prosecuting. 
Unemployed Stephen Wilcocks, 23, pleaded guilty to threatening <tag>behaviour</> at The Woodstock Arms on December 28, and having a knife with him in a public place.

It is not only advantageous for us to know which of a horse's emotions are destructive to us having a good working relationship with it; but ideally, if we also consider horse will do more for us and give us greater pleasure. 
Even so, when handling and riding horses, we really need to be able to anticipate their emotions, actions and reactions, rather than simply expecting perfect behaviour and performance from them. 
We can anticipate a horse's <tag>behaviour</> and emotions through knowledge, commonsense, empathy, and perception.  

700235
But at least it was ready for the purpose its makers had in mind. 
It was great to steer, and not just because there was an odds-on chance of arriving at point B instead of expiring a short distance from point A. 
These cars were special enough to bring on irrational <tag>behaviour</>.   

700236
As bombshells went, it outclassed Dr Alfred Kinsey's previous findings about the Human Male. 
The sexual <tag>behaviour</> referred to turned out to be sexual misbehaviour by the standards of the time and on a widespread scale.   

700237
`In support of the American rule, it has been argued that since litigation is at best uncertain one should not be penalized for defending or prosecuting a law suit, and that the poor might be unjustly discouraged from instituting actions to vindicate their rights if the penalty for losing included the fees for their opponents' counsel &ellip. . 
Also, the time, expense, and difficulties of proof inherent in litigating the question of what constitutes reasonable attorney's fees would pose substantial burdens for judicial administration." 
Recent studies, some buttressed by economic analysis, have pursued the effect of alternative fee rules on litigation <tag>behaviour</> with more theoretical rigour.   

700238
His converse with James was easy and laconic, and Michael did his best not to find it pleasing for the wrong reasons. 
James himself was however touched by no such atavistic memories and his simple and open <tag>behaviour</> soon disposed of Michael's problem.   

700239
By contrast, only a quarter of men were worried by this situation. 
Comments such as those above show how awareness of crime is a familiar reality in many people's lives and how, for women especially, a concern for personal safety becomes built into their everyday <tag>behaviour</> in a number of ways.  

700240
They all had intimate knowledge of one another's lives. 
He knew no one at all in the village and was therefore at a total disadvantage when the supposed disciple came forward, since he had no context in which to place him or to interpret his <tag>behavior</> other than at its face value (it is precisely face value that a real sheikh sees behind).

In the morning we slipped it back under the hen, and at once it was part of the family. 
The mother, as I say, may or may not be the hen which hatched the first brood; but from her <tag>behaviour</>, which seems slightly less frenetic, I reckon she is someone else.

It's a substitute for confronting their own inner void.

Moral matters are complicated by the revelation that Yatzek's lovely little sister was killed by a drunk tractor-driving friend, after the two young men had been drinking in secret. 
But sociologists can always find some kind of excuse for anti-social <tag>behavior</>.   

700245
Well clearly &ellip 
And I think that's where the problems emerge, that they're not doing anything, I think, quite often different to the sort of <tag>behaviour</> one might find elsewhere, but there's a question of how, as an institution, you regulate the behaviour that's acceptable within your own walls.

`First we have to break down the stigma that psychiatry still has among the Palestinians, the feeling that lying or stealing can only be a problem of discipline.

Sir: 
Your argument ('Police spies in a free society', 30 November) against the encouragement of members of the public to inform the police of others who drink and drive is misconceived and does little to assist those both within the criminal justice system and in society at large who seek to reduce by various means the incidence of such <tag>behaviour</>.

She saw friends whom she knew he would dislike. 
Among them was Noel Spens, a young reporter, who was in fact a slight acquaintance of Paul's, and whose accurate mockery of her husband Dora accepted with vehement protests, knowing it eased something in her heart. 
Dora did not approve of her <tag>behaviour</>.

The wobbly Sharpless of Mario Basiola is also no match for the splendid Rolando Panerai in the Barbirolli set. 
What the 1939 set offers beyond any rival is the most positive Pinkerton ever in Gigli, again a chubby-sounding, chuckling character, whose caddish <tag>behaviour</> plainly stems from mere thoughtlessness, and who wins us away from condemnation by sheer personality.

It seems, however, to be difficult for educators to strike a balance of informing and yet not frightening their audience. 
Information about the sexually transmitted diseases may well have the effect of putting people off `VD", but does not seem to have any effect on their sexual <tag>behaviour</>.

The Government has said that the purpose of this section is to control conduct like 
` rowdy <tag>behaviour</> in the streets late at night which alarms local residents; someone turning out the lights in a crowded dance hall, in a way likely to cause panic; groups of youths persistently shouting abuse and obscenities or pestering people waiting to catch public transport or to enter a hall or cinema; hooligans on housing estates causing disturbances in the common parts of blocks of flats, blockading entrances, throwing things down the stairs, banging on doors, peering in at windows and knocking over dustbins.

Neither have the comments of Sir Reginald Murley, former president of the Royal College of Surgeons, who stated his belief earlier in November that the caption in the last Aids campaign should have read: `Fortunately this young woman is unlikely to develop Aids unless she becomes a drug addict or allows herself to be buggered". 
Further, the Health Education Authority has disbanded its Aids division, a national survey of sexual <tag>behaviour</> has been cancelled, and a campaign promoting condom use indefinitely postponed.

Interaction within management tends to be vertical, i.e. between superior and subordinate. 
Operations and working <tag>behaviour</> are governed by instructions and decisions issued by superiors.   

700259
There is more ancient evil about than we are willing to credit. 
A second plausible explanation, more recent, derives from the siting of the gallows which serviced the garrison at Charles Fort. 
There were, from time to time, above 12,000 soldiers, many of them unfortunate Englishmen, stationed within the walls of the fort and under canvas without them and it was the policy of successive commanders to discourage licentious <tag>behaviour</>, all too easily learnt from the native Irish, by hanging miscreants in the vicinity of Rathmore. 

700260
Or is it gulped down quickly, before someone comes  in and points an accusing finger?

New powers to end anti-competitive <tag>behaviour</> by local authorities, granted by the Local Government Act 1988, are to be used for the first time by Chris Patten, Secretary of State for the Environment.   

700263
Much of conventional organisation theory is concerned with the exercise of control in this sense. 
This latter sense in which the term `control" is used contains the notion that individuals performing tasks which contribute to some larger end-product or end-service will be prepared to adjust their <tag>behaviour</> in order to enhance their contribution to the overall task.   

700264
The built-in delay would give a couple time to sort out their property and finances and the arrangements for their children, see where they would stand after the divorce, and be sure they really wanted to take the final step. 
At present, the split of money and property comes after the divorce decree, often too late for a change of mind. 
But the Scottish Law Commission has now produced a compromise report, recommending retaining adultery and intolerable <tag>behaviour</> but reducing the separation periods for those choosing this ground to one year with consent and two years without (from the present two and five).

BOLLARDS could be put up at Wolvercote Green in an effort to stop the annual summer invasion of travellers. 
Wolvercote residents submitted a 221-signature petition to the council claiming the presence of the travellers rendered both Wolvercote and Goose Green an `unsafe environment for local residents due to the aggressive and intimidating <tag>behaviour</> of travellers and their dogs".
