Dan looked at his daughter through his dark glasses, as a <tag>rabbit</> might look at a stoat: dismay, fear, despair.   

700007
The film companies believe consumer acceptance is also less. 
For example, Who Framed Roger <tag>Rabbit</> is only going to be available this year for rental.   

700008
The band describe the cover as an anti-sexist statement, concerning itself with male indifference. 
The record shops thought it was plain frightening. 
The group have agreed to compromise by making available a substitute sleeve, done in less controversial taste: the woman's place is taken by a teddy bear, and the man's by a fluffy <tag>rabbit</>. 

700009
Would you like to go and look?" 
Anything Richard could suggest was irresistible and Tory nodded.

What may have been someone's idea of a joke terrified two dogs and left two pet <tag>rabbits</> dead. 

700013
Groans! 
I should think there was a fearful roar, or several, for the moving object turned out to be not a <tag>rabbit</> but two men who had taken to the undergrowth for what might be described as private purposes.   

700014
Fifty yards ahead five fallow deer move slowly, enjoying the morning sun before slipping silently into the hazel thickets. 
A <tag>rabbit</> bolts from under your feet, but you don't fire because you are lighting a cigarette.

Such banks are made from earth with  a clay core. 
They can be fatally weakened by <tag>rabbit</> or mole holes, or by trees  growing in the bank, which, if they blow down, can create a breach.   

700016
Cajuns were originally French/Canadian settlers, driven out by the British in the mid-18th century from what was then called Arcadia, now Nova Scotia. 
Known as Cadians, they founded a new homeland in the backwoods of south Louisiana, where they discovered bountiful supplies of game &dash. <tag>rabbit</>, squirrel, pigeon and deer, and helpful native Indians who taught them how to make the most of local wild produce. 

700017
THE MOST exhaustively studied rabbit warren in Britain may soon disappear under concrete, burying a research programme into the vicious, incestuous and highly-sexed social life of the rabbit before it has the chance to cast new light on evolution. 
Biologists at the University of East Anglia are fighting plans for a residential block for students and conference delegates and a physiotherapy centre to be sited on the warren they have been studying for the past seven years. 
Dr Diana Bell and Dr Nicola Webb have won research grants to `genetically fingerprint" three generations of <tag>rabbits</>, one born each year, using the advanced technique which enables forensic scientists to track down rapists and murderers from small samples of blood, hair and semen. 

700018
A small window on to the yard offered sufficient light for him to make out the cheese and butter and sacks of sugar and rice. 
He moved into the farthest room, which had a tiny square of window set in its far wall and overlooking the rear driveway. 
It was a small dark place with a dank smell, the coolest of the three rooms and often used for stacking the carcasses of <tag>rabbits</>, chickens and turkeys.

Elsewhere in the park, scaled-down Vintage reproduction cars take visitors on a scenic old-time drive through the countryside. 
There'll be a few surprises along the way and perhaps you might even catch a glimpse of <tag>rabbits</> playing or ducks sleeping in the sun.   

700023
At the other extreme, one thinks of rich connoisseurs jetting in for legendary grandes bouffes on the shores of Lake Geneva, and of well-disciplined kitchens where an apprenticeship is the equivalent of a Harvard MBA for Europe's fledgling chefs. 
These kitchens have also been the breeding ground for some of Britain's life-enhancing culinary talents, such as Paul Gayler and Anton Mosimann. 
Mosimann reminisces almost lyrically about the home cooking of his childhood, with its body-and-soul-sustaining soups, fragrant pork and <tag>rabbit</> stews, vivid salads of winter vegetables with aromatic dressings, and such substantial bulwarks against the cold as the Berne platter: a mound of sauerkraut surrounded by a dozen different fresh or smoked meats and sausages.   

700024
They was real interesting though. 
We saw loads of other things too &dash. squirrels and <tag>rabbits</> and that.   

700025
Of the main courses, roast pigeon is delectable, sweetly seared, roast garlic and jus spooned over it. 
<tag>Rabbit</> might be prepared with girolles and tarragon, chicken might be simply roasted. 

700026
Some weeks later, my suspicion that nesting had occurred was pretty well confirmed by the delightful sight of five buzzards &dash. presumably the two parents and three youngsters &dash. circling over the town. 
Now it seems possible that breeding may occur again, for on a recent visit on a glorious sunny day, over a wide ride right in the heart of the forest, a pair of buzzards were performing a mutual display. 
Although <tag>rabbits</> were once considered to be the staple food of buzzards, and a dramatic decline in numbers occurred with the introduction of myxomatosis, this bird has a wide range of diet &dash. its persecution (albeit illegal) by sheep farmers arises from the fact that it may be a carrion-feeder, and haunts lambing flocks both for the afterbirth and the occasional dead lamb. 

700027
Otherwise you would almost certainly crash into a stone wall. 
About half the rabbits are mixy &dash. have myxomatosis &dash. and half healthy, though the ratio varies from year to year. 
This year I would say we have more healthy <tag>rabbits</> than mixy ones. 

700028
I thought of my kids making such a find, and it turned my stomach." 
Louise and her brother Carl picked out a black lop-eared and grey dwarf <tag>rabbit</> from a litter of five.

(By the time she was calling me Horn F. we were already several months into the rival declension of Bug: Big Bug, Bigsy Bug, Biggity Bug, Buggy Doo, Biggy Doo, Biggy Dooley, Biggity Big Bug, Bogo, Biggo, Bugadooley, Boger, Bobey, Little Bober, Bolo, etc.) 
Perhaps I was influenced by memories of the coziness of Bag-End in The Hobbit and of Peter <tag>Rabbit's</> firelit bungalow, and by the cover of Revolver, where a miniature Beatle tries to climb out of Paul's ear canal. 

700034
Even the goods manager at King's Cross station, a salaried employee, left his children no more than some bedroom furniture.` 
With rare exceptions, in working-class families aid from grandparents to their adult children was at best symbolic: a parcel of <tag>rabbits</> from the country, or a turkey sent for Christmas.   

700035
Next door lived a couple in their forties without children. 
They kept <tag>rabbits</> at the bottom of the garden and the man would say to the girl, `Why don't you come in and feed my rabbits?"   

700036
Seemingly, no-one is safe from their remorseless attacks: right-on 11 year-old skatefreaks (`Rad Dude"), Ray Reardon (`Spooky Perv Happenings In The Snooker Hall"), Ozzy Osbourne (`Betty Ford's Clinic").

He found the ageing sybil, with `her eagle look", to be {deadGuys}. 
In the third year of war, the orchards were dug up for beans and potatoes; but there were still the usual numbers of cage birds, to which were added a hysterical parrot, a monkey, a goat, two dogs and seven <tag>rabbits</>.

First it was frost, then came the drought. 
Now Oxfordshire grain growers are facing a new enemy, the Super Rabbit. 
Super <tag>Rabbit</> is different from anything ever seen before in the county because he seems pretty well indestructible.   

700042
The two directors have done their best, speeding the tale along on the wings of Bessie Smith and mouth-organ blues. 
And the actresses themselves are a delight: Josette Bushell-Mingo has an extraordinarily mobile face and an infectiously comic manner, Joy Richardson shows an uncanny ability to get inside a 10-year-old's skin, and Angela Bruce, as the mother, has natural authority. 
The rape scene takes place with breathtaking violence, the fair exudes riotous conviviality, and the Brer <tag>Rabbit</> japes come over with gusto. 

700043
His fingers and eyes stopped moving. 
One long-ago summer evening that had presumably had to be got through somehow, Freddie, Clare, he and no doubt other boring little pre-adolescent creatures had been playing a round game too flat and uninventive to be called anything he could remember, but whose object, he recalled quite well enough, had been to guess the other fellow's favourite possession or thing most valued, understanding this in the broadest sense to include anything from a favourite walk or view to a pet <tag>rabbit</>.   

700044
In as much as the traditional English sitcom has a morality it is to comfort the comfortable, so this departure is worth noting. 
That other Liverpudlian despatch Brookside (Channel 4), always cockily topical, had got the `flu epidemic in but otherwise had much the same message as Bread about the horror of the holiday. 
ITV deserves credit for commissioning an animated film &dash. The BFG (Thames), after Roald Dahl &dash. instead of buying one from Disney, although you wonder whether the thing looked a bit too much like early Walt for the Roger <tag>Rabbit</> generation.   

700045
This year they have been left alone because they moved their kennels from an address known to the `antis".

Then another bus of ga-ga geriatrics rolls up and the fun really starts. 
A story of cold turkey, warm bitter, apes in monkey suits and an IRA gunman in the gents (not forgetting Elvis Costello and the dead <tag>rabbit</>).

At polling booths yesterday, voters grappled with ballot papers the size of this page. 
There were so many candidates that the Election Commission exhausted its list of ballot symbols and had to invent more than 40 more. 
In addition to the Congress (I) hand and the opposition Janata Dal wheel, the Bhiwani ballot paper boasted such unlikely symbols of political ambition as a tap, a canoe, a goat, a boy scout, a <tag>rabbit</>, a turtle, a light bulb and a balloon.   

700049
Unfortunately, there are still performances where you hear Schubert played amiably, and you don't feel endangered by anything. 
There are others where the music sounds like a <tag>rabbit</> that has been hypnotised by a snake, falling into a completely catatonic state &dash. which is also no way to express the anxiety that some of Schubert's music should convey.

700056
Myxomatosis holds no real fears for him, thanks to his secret genetic resistance and immunity to the one-time killer disease. 
But the new healthier breed of rabbit is proving no joke for farmers, and rabbits are now beginning to take a big bite out of cereal profit margins in what is already promising to be a difficult year. 
A Ministry of Agriculture estimate says that the fast-increasing number of <tag>rabbits</> in Britain is causing damage amounting to about #120 million to farmers' crops.   

700057
But the university authorities want building work to begin in the spring of 1991, when Drs Bell and Webb's grants expire. 
The researchers say they must continue beyond then or risk seeing their research invalidated. 
They probably need to study more than three generations to collect a worthwhile amount of data and to follow the lifespans of <tag>rabbits</> who can live for six years or more in the wild.

And yet, if the Japanese designers did get rid of personal air outlets, murmuring contemptuously among themselves about `barbaric holdovers from the infancy of cabin pressurization," I expected to feel, the first time I noticed their absence, the same sort of long-awaited jolt of grief I felt when in the early seventies, intent on being a composer, I came across horrifying articles in the Arts and Leisure section with titles like `Is the Symphony Orchestra Dead?" 
Like a reporter assigned the obituary page, I gathered my envoical emotions together ahead of time to be ready for the loss: I recalled how I once tried to stretch a balloon around an air nozzle but was ordered to sit down before I found out whether it would inflate; and how, while my sister was occupied with a connect-the-dot book, I very stealthily stole her air and aimed it so that I could revel in a twin convergence; and how, pretending to study the stewardess-call button, I pointed my mother's, my sister's, and my own nozzles toward my sister and turned them all on full, so that the corner of her half-connected <tag>rabbit</> page flapped out of control. 

700066
The authors of Blueprint for a Green Economy express the belief that it is possible to put a money value on the benefit of preserving the rare Californian condor, so why not on chalk-hill blue butterflies?

700076
LIFE IN an American orchestra can produce some peculiar contrasts. 
A few weeks ago the Pittsburgh Symphony found itself giving a pair of concerts for the Disney channel with Roger Rabbit (the one who got framed).

700077
It eats the plant that Britain grows best of all &dash. grass; but to be a successful grass-eater an animal has to be big. 
Grass has a low energy and protein content relative to its bulk; big animals use less energy, weight for weight, than small animals; so only big animals &dash. bigger than a grouse, among birds, or a <tag>rabbit</>, among mammals &dash. can subsist on such fare.

So let's go to work, Brer <tag>Rabbit</>.

My daughter said that she'd love to catch it and keep it for a pet but in fact we only admired it for a while as it played, and then we drove on. 
It could be a wild <tag>rabbit</> &dash. or even an escaped pet's progeny. 

700093
This was admirable, though the uncharitable thought occurred that, if you were going to transgress legislation about promoting homosexuality, the ambiguous language of dance was one of the safest ways of going about it. 
In fact DV8's Never Again contained some impressive and chilling images; of bodies hung up like sides of meat; of the messy gestures of a party slowly marshalling themselves to a beat, so that a wave of welcome turned into a fascist salute and a gesture of invitation into a <tag>rabbit</> punch.   

700095
The same was true of the trams and Metro. 
We were particularly taken by the self-starting escalators and the piped music on the stations &dash. Brandenburg concertos must ease the rigour of commuting. 
The great attractions for us were the patisseries, with their marzipan confections that change with the season &dash. cribs at Christmas, bandaged <tag>rabbits</> in the hunting season.

The worst-hit farmers appear to be those growing winter wheat on areas of dry soil.

The result is an abundance of timeless tales which will delight any fisherman. 
The book, published next Thursday, trawls through society and showbiz, literature, politics and the arts to produce free-ranging anthology, and many of the tales are certain to slip into fishing folklore. 
Her contributors include Ted Hughes and George Melley, Tommy Sopwith and Richard Adams (who will enjoy the tale of the swimming <tag>rabbit</>), concert pianist Peter Katin, gynaecologist Roger de Vere, Lord Sieff, Lord Home and Lord Forte, Richie Benaud and the Duke of Wellington.

Weddings were smaller affairs then, more intimate than they tend to be now. 
The feast would have been long saved for, and would have boasted plenty of meats, sweets and intoxicants. 
Rabbit pie or <tag>rabbit</> brawn would be served and one of the pork meat specialities of the region.

One on its own is not a kind thing to contemplate unless it is a buck. 
As to your little girl getting hurt, it sounds as though she has picked the rabbit up in such a way that its powerful hind legs caught her; it did not actually attack her.

The worst-hit farmers appear to be those growing winter wheat on areas of dry soil. 
There is now also concern that many young trees, planted under Government woodland and hedgerow schemes, are being destroyed through rabbits nibbling on saplings and hedge sprigs. 
Adas says it has begun to receive calls from farmers complaining about neighbours failing to prevent <tag>rabbits</> moving on to their land.   

700110
Stacking this week, I thought of the woodland from which these thinnings had come. 
The old forest of beech was felled during the Second World War; someone from the village who walked up the hill as a boy remembers how the work was all done by hand, with cross-cut saws, and how at 4pm every afternoon it was `down saws and down ferrets" as the men went after <tag>rabbits</>.

Charterville sprang from the idea of placing industrial workers back on the land and increasing the numbers of 40 shilling freeholders entitled to vote under the Reform Bill of 1832. 
E Crossing the road the path leads beside an old parish boundary hedge with many species of flowering shrubs. 
Small animals such as <tag>rabbits</>, hares, stoats, weasels and even foxes have riddled the hedge with their runs and holes.

The same race is divided into two today, and the spoils should be split between Adding ((2.15), from the in-form stable of Guy Harwood, and Toucan (5.45), a Luca Cumani runner who finished well when third to stablemate Chirone at Yarmouth last month. 
Also at Haydock, the 5lb claim of talented apprentice jockey Jimmy Fortune eases the burden on topweight NATIVE GEM (4.45) and this filly's consistency should be rewarded. 
Best of a full but not very dis tinguished rental month (the blockbusters are coming in November, leading with Rain Man, Roger <tag>Rabbit</>, Dangerous Liaisons and Mississippi Burning) is Parents (18 Vestron), which is simultaneously both scary and funny. 

700116
But as Steve McIvor from BUAV points out, in commercial terms, companies need to update their products and BWC's policy, though admirable, is restrictive in product development. 
The BUAV awards a white <tag>rabbit</> logo to companies which adhere to the five-year policy.

They will meet the university authorities today in an attempt to find a compromise. 
`Rabbits aren't the Watership Down characters who simply pack their bags and move off to pastures new," Dr Bell said.

The aged negro studied his pleading client in the hallway, in the afternoon shadows. 
`You in good shape, Brer <tag>Rabbit</>?" he asked.

It could be a wild rabbit &dash. or even an escaped pet's progeny. 
It's illegal to capture any of our indigenous species for pets. 
If your little girl wants to keep rabbits, buy a copy of `Care for your <tag>Rabbit</>" by Collins or send a large stamped addressed envelope plus 25p to the RSPCA headquarters at Horsham, West Sussex (RH12 1HG) for their Rabbit booklet.

Now a youthful-looking 55, her dedication to her writing is surpassed only by her continuing devotion to animals. 
She shares her elegant, 400-year-old home on the banks of the River Thames with a menagerie of three dogs, seven cats, two tortoises, two <tag>rabbits</>, three guinea pigs, numerous fish and 60 birds.   

700124
The researchers say they must continue beyond then or risk seeing their research invalidated. 
They probably need to study more than three generations to collect a worthwhile amount of data and to follow the lifespans of rabbits who can live for six years or more in the wild. 
The researchers are asking for another five years beyond 1991; three to complete their studies and another two to move the <tag>rabbits</> gradually into a new warren nearby.   

700125
And she was still turning away, making herself a smaller target. 
Suddenly Gerrard was behind him, head popping out of the cabin like a <tag>rabbit</> from a hole.

The big Irishman had been teasing him all along, just to make him look ridiculous in front of all those other men. 
He had never intended to turn the dog loose, only to scare Frankie into scuttling for safety like a terrified <tag>rabbit</> running ahead of the hounds.   

700129
(One could pause here and raise questions of an ethico-legal kind but so obvious a temptation must be resisted.) 
In short, <tag>rabbits</> dead and alive are part of the landscape.   

700130
It is no cheaper per yard than permanent cattle-mesh fencing, but is so light and easy to erect that its versatility outweighs the cost. 
All electric fencing requires regular attention to ensure the system is `alive" and not earthed out by wet grass touching the wires. 
Netting is particularly prone to such earthing, and the bottom horizontal (which is not electrified) is frequently bitten through by <tag>rabbits</> or badgers, making gaps for lambs to squeeze through. 

700131
No matter that the forester laid in wait for him and remonstrated, pointing out that the gate swung sweetly on its hinges, and that walkers could proceed on their way with the minimum of obstruction. 
No matter that he cogently argued the need to exclude <tag>rabbits</> and hares until the new trees were established.   

700132
Although he knew that they could not reach beyond the full extension of their chains, Frankie was never fully convinced that he was safe from them. 
Two stone steps and a low wide door in the far wall led up to a smaller kitchen, and beyond that was the gloomy pantry where trussed birds and enormous rounds of butter and cheese were stacked on cold stone slabs. 
Drums of powdered milk and dried egg were kept there, and sometimes the walls were hung with dead <tag>rabbits</> and the flagged floor littered with bloody skins.   

700135
That is the only reason for mentioning the matter. 
A few winters ago we had several weeks of freezing weather, but with scarcely a covering of snow to protect the grass. 
As a result the <tag>rabbits</> came out of the frozen fields and down from the hills in their thousands and congregated in gardens and on the roads looking for something to eat.   

700136
Elder and blackthorn bushes offered patches of shade. 
A <tag>rabbit</> thumped the verge in alarm at the horseman's approach, then scurried into the rye stalks. the evening was fragrant, warm and rich, lit by the great wash of gold light that flooded through the cloud chasms in the western skies.

In the country or on the coast they can re-create their routine of earlier days. 
They rise early by the alarm clock, so the husband can go out to work &dash. cultivating vegetables, rearing <tag>rabbits</> and poultry in the garden, and mending things in his shed.

What may have been someone's idea of a joke terrified two dogs and left two pet rabbits dead. 
Now the police at Didcot are hoping to trace the owners of the dogs which were shut up with the rabbits in a hutch at Cholsey. 
The dead victims of the prank &dash. if that's what it was &dash. were Tatty and Oldbit, two four months old <tag>rabbits</> which were the pets of the Bolt family at 44 Crescent Way, Cholsey.

I just stood by him and hung on in there and we eventually got the album finished. 
Another thing was that we were working with a skeleton staff at the studio as a lot of them were on holiday and for the first week we were eating frozen <tag>rabbits</> without any vegetables.

Then to April, `I'll have a word with Parkinson the gamekeeper if there's anything you'd like. 
How about a couple of rabbits?" 
`We haven't had <tag>rabbit</> for a while.

Children are made welcome at The Star Inn with smaller portions available on most main courses as well as a range of children's favourites always being available. 
There are children's rides in the garden as well as a collection of birds and animals including <tag>rabbits</> which are given away free to good homes.

One on its own is not a kind thing to contemplate unless it is a buck. 
As to your little girl getting hurt, it sounds as though she has picked the <tag>rabbit</> up in such a way that its powerful hind legs caught her; it did not actually attack her.

The French invented factory skiing, along with all the checks and balances that implies. 
Alpine France is dominated by new brutalist architecture: stacked <tag>rabbit</> hutches reaching into the sky; chains of pizzerias and hamburger restaurants; cramped supermarkets.

`Beatrix had a love of animals and the countryside as her parents and the family spent three months of the year in the Lake District and Scotland. 
Her animals became characters in her books, her pet <tag>rabbit</> was Peter Rabbit and her hedgehog was Mrs Tiggy-winkle," said Mrs Price.

Biologists at the University of East Anglia are fighting plans for a residential block for students and conference delegates and a physiotherapy centre to be sited on the warren they have been studying for the past seven years. 
Dr Diana Bell and Dr Nicola Webb have won research grants to `genetically fingerprint" three generations of rabbits, one born each year, using the advanced technique which enables forensic scientists to track down rapists and murderers from small samples of blood, hair and semen. 
This DNA fingerprinting should allow them to establish how the <tag>rabbits</> are related and how many children individual males and females have.

Mrs Valerie Bolt said yesterday Tue: `About twenty to nine this morning I sent my eldest son, Roger, who is nearly seven, out to the shed to get his younger brother's bike." 
`He came running in saying `Mummy, Mummy, there's a rabbit on the path and there's two dogs in the hutch."" She found a dead rabbit lying on the path and two dogs, one a Jack Russell and the other cross bred, in the hutch. 
`The other <tag>rabbit</> was in there with them.   

700150
Any attempt here to remove human discretion by expanding on the US Declaration of Independence will yield a nil result. 
For if both the fox and the <tag>rabbit</> are entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, which right shall prevail in the event of conflict between the two?   

700151
An advertisement on a blockbuster video can reach a bigger audience than one shown on network television. 
So not only is McDonald's promoting Roger <tag>Rabbit</>, but on the US version of Batman, due out in early November, there will be an advertisement for Diet Coke.

`I'll have to leave you now I'm afraid, I have matters to attend to," Parkinson said to Charlie and Maggie. 
He then instructed Merryfield to see to their grouse and <tag>rabbits</> `Only halfway through the afternoon and it's like night!"

Mr Elson was the leader of the democrat group on Oxfordshire County Council when he lost his seat to Conservative Mrs Delia Smith at the last election. 
A seven-year-old Oxfordshire schoogirl recoiled in horror when she found the headless bodies of her pet <tag>rabbits</>.   

700156
When you think of what birds have to go through &dash. shooters, hunters, in Malta, Spain, Italy and Cyprus &dash. I'm stunned that anything survives with cats around as well. 
` <tag>Rabbits</> they say, are very scarce today.  

700157
It was against this background that a farmer's daughter called the other evening nursing a young rabbit with an injured leg. 
She had found it on her way home and, in obedience to another instinct which says, wisely or otherwise, that when in doubt consult the post office, she brought it for examination and advice. 
Such veterinary skills as we possess, and they are not great, suggested that the <tag>rabbit</> should be left in a quiet place safe from predators for more detailed examination next morning. 

700158

Through a chink in the cupboard door, Henry observed her pull the lid off the vase and peer down at whatever Rush had put in it. 
If it was <tag>rabbits</> she was presumably looking at a whole colony.   

700162
About half the rabbits are mixy &dash. have myxomatosis &dash. and half healthy, though the ratio varies from year to year. 
This year I would say we have more healthy rabbits than mixy ones. 
The mixy <tag>rabbits</> are a miserable sight.   

700163
`The latch had been on so that the dogs couldn't get out &dash. that was the sickening part of it." 
The dogs were shaking and obviously petrified. 
`The <tag>rabbit</> outside on the path was ruffled and had some blood on its back, but neither had been savaged," she said.   

700164
And it's very hot and not nice for children, so you can stay in England and go to a boarding school like Alex &dash. won't that be fun?"

It is available free from the Countryside Commission Publications, 19-23 Albert Street, Manchester. 
Beatrix Potter's Peter Rabbit is one of Japan's most famous characters: he is often the first Englishman encountered by young readers, and the miniature quality of Potter's stories and illustrations strikes some deep chord in the Japanese heart. 
To tell the story behind The Tale of Peter <tag>Rabbit</>, an exhibition of Beatrix Potter's Lake District will open in Tokyo on 20 September in the presence of HRH the Princess Royal, before moving on to Osaka and Okayama and finishing on 16 October in Kyoto.

Trouble comes from the fact that instinct drives them to supplement their rations with wild prey. 
No matter that they are already stuffed to the eyebrows with Whiskas, Go-Cat, Purrfect, Science Diet or even &dash. Jasper's favourite &dash. fresh deer liver. 
They must also catch mice, rats, shrews, moles, young <tag>rabbits</> and birds.   

700168
Under supervision, the pair should get along fine. 
A female rabbit is preferable, especially a pair who can be full-time companions. 
A male rabbit is best kept on its own, or at least separately from other <tag>rabbits</>.   

700169
The pathological process responsible for the lesions is, as in early syphilis, an inflammation and blocking of the small arteries. 
Treponemes are difficult to find microscopically in these lesions, but if material from a gumma is injected into a <tag>rabbit</>, it will produce a syphilitic infection.  

700170
It is a kind of death of the person, a disappearance of the one who once had been.

And if we can accord rights we can equally exact duties (can't we? &dash. one would seriously like to know). 
Getting down to cases we can therefore say that if it is the right of the injured <tag>rabbit</> to have its leg attended to, then equally it is the duty of the selfsame rabbit not to eat our garden produce or the grazing intended for our neighbour's sheep.

This isn't the home, or indeed the beard, of Edward Lear's famous old man, but Pages Farm in Slaidburn, Lancashire, on the edge of the Forest of Bowland (pronounced `Bolland"). 
The place is a miniature Noah's Ark, with turkeys, ducks, <tag>rabbits</>, chickens and goats all falling over each other, and for some reason, when I stayed, a gaggle of geese eating a duvet on the back lawn.

This is what I meant by `built-in unfairness", and by `asymmetry in the cost of failure".

Sometimes, though, you are not as alone as you think.

I'm no admirer of Penguin's direction at the moment, all this business of its centre going to New York.

And if we can accord rights we can equally exact duties (can't we? &dash. one would seriously like to know). 
Getting down to cases we can therefore say that if it is the right of the injured rabbit to have its leg attended to, then equally it is the duty of the selfsame rabbit not to eat our garden produce or the grazing intended for our neighbour's sheep.

Other additions are green houses and garden sheds. 
If you want the garage to be used for your car, a garden shed would be advantageous while the greenhouse is a godsend for someone keen on flowers and vegetables. 
If you keep animals you can opt for anything from an aviary to <tag>rabbit</> hutches.

It follows research carried out in other countries on Neanderthal material, principally from Israel and Yugoslavia, which reached similar conclusions. 
Preliminary excavations in Gibraltar have revealed large numbers of well-made flint tools, evidence of camp-fires and cooked meals, and the bones of animals which appear to have contributed to Neanderthal cuisine: <tag>rabbits</>, red deer, ibex, and tortoise.

Once even  quite a small hole has been made, flood-water will quickly force its way through  it, causing the whole system to collapse. 
This is called a `bank-blow" and men  of the lowlands have always lived in terror of such blows, which explains why  river engineers are anxious to maintain their raised banks free of shrubs and  trees and close-mown or grazed so that moles and <tag>rabbits</> can be quickly detected.   

700208
Otherwise you would almost certainly crash into a stone wall. 
About half the <tag>rabbits</> are mixy &dash. have myxomatosis &dash. and half healthy, though the ratio varies from year to year. 

700209
Mr Rogich says, unhelpfully: `I look at everything from the historical point of view because I think that gives greater impact to the message." 
Tell that one to the White <tag>Rabbit</>. 

700210
Its service took nearly half the yield from taxation, against 14 per cent. before the war. 
The National Debt had the effect of a snake on a <tag>rabbit</>: it deprived even the most educated of sense.   

700211
`Today has got the whole story." 
I looked out of the window to see Yardies running like <tag>rabbits</> in all directions.   

700212
There's a lovely spring in the turf." 
`Except you have to watch for the <tag>rabbit</> holes. 

700213
Not that he believed that the firing he had heard had been caused by the French. 
They were not expected to advance till July, and were certainly not expected in this part of Belgium, so Sharpe suspected that the musketry had been caused by Prussian troops at firing practice, yet a long acquaintance with war's surprises had spurred Sharpe to investigate the sound. 
His horse put up waterfowl and once disturbed a whole field of <tag>rabbits</> that scampered in panic towards the hedgerows.   

700214
He announced his credo unashamedly in his first editorial: `We believe we are filling a publishing need only slightly less important than the one just taken care of by the Kinsey Report." 
Playboy was described as a pleasure-primer, its symbol was a <tag>rabbit</> and its bait was the Playmate of the month, the girl who was unfolded in the centre wearing a staple through her navel but not much else. 

700216
We dined at three o'clock and were an hour and a half at it. 
`We had <tag>rabbits</> for supper roasted.   

700217
Is it, to enlarge the question, permissible for man to interfere for an animal's benefit but not to its detriment, or should man take no part in the animal scene at all? 
There are dodgy answers to these questions which say, for example, that it is man's fault there are so many <tag>rabbits</> to start with.   

700218
Why give up one's supper-time, disorganise the evening, empty the log basket to provide housing, fetch lettuce and water, and generally cause oneself anxiety, all for the sake of an animal which, given another couple of days, might well have been victim to one of the invited guns &dash. invited, perhaps by the girl's own father, from Keighley ? 
And while we are on the subject, what would the animal rights campaigners have done with the thousands of rabbits during that bleak mid-winter ? 
Did they approve of shooting or would they have let the <tag>rabbits</> starve more slowly to death?  

700219
It would, of course, be very difficult to create a formula. 
A lepidopterist might be able to quote a going price for a preserved chalk-hill blue in good condition, wild <tag>rabbits</> have a price when shot and skinned, but the market price of Twyford Down itself would be low if sold with legal constraints which kept it as an open, public space and high if sold with planning permission for houses or industry (or even a road). 

700220
In the final position, there is no defence to a quick mate, starting with Rh1+. 
Who Framed Roger <tag>Rabbit</>, Rain Man, Working Girl, Dangerous Liaisons, Mississippi Burning: this is the starriest video release month of the year, with blockbusters jostling for space on the shelves as the nights draw in and Christmas slumps the nation into its armchairs. 

700221
How could a few hundred square metres of sterile galvanised steel replace the ever-changing variety and abundance of a tropical forest? 
We condemn millions of animals to death every year, trying to cure diseases that are often self-inflicted &dash. or worse still, to convince ourselves that because it takes pints of shampoo to kill a <tag>rabbit</>, the product must be safe for humans. 

700222
If Vic had been explaining Industry Year to the other three students, he had been very brief, for the room was silent when Robyn returned with Marion Russell. 
Vic was frowning at his copy of Tennyson, and the students were watching him as <tag>rabbits</> watch a stoat.   

700223
At first they stood like statues, face to face, bewitched by the strange power of their own emotions. 
Richard had already been remarked as the kind of small boy enchanted by small girls and deaf to the ridicule of his peers on the matter; on this occasion he watched Victoria twist her curls around her fingers in motionless fascination for ten minutes, then followed her for the rest of the afternoon, fetching drinks and finding seats, carrying her favourite blue <tag>rabbit</> when she dropped it and picking out the choicest pieces of bread and butter for her at tea.   

700224
I would not call it a plague but we are certainly seeing more rabbits around than at any time since the myxomatosis of the 1950s," said Mr Adrian Meyer, wildlife biologist of Adas (Agricultural Development Advisory Service). 
The explosion in the rabbit population has resulted from rabbits becoming increasingly immune to the disease which killed millions of rabbits in the fifties and sixties. 
While the <tag>rabbit</> population appears to have built up a genetic resistance to myxomatosis, strains of the disease in Britain appear to be much less virulent in recent years. 

700225
Hefner himself was soon to develop this idea in his so-called `Playboy Philosophy" at tedious length. 
As the Fifties ended he was on the point of multiplying millions by opening the first Playboy Club, in Chicago, where the girls, not the customers, were dressed as <tag>rabbits</>.   

700227
`Why are you boycotting the Moscow Olympics?" One snowy Christmas Eve my car's starter failed. 
Four or five guards gave me a push-start through Checkpoint Charlie, sending me east with a seasonal cheer. 
Gentle animal-lovers, they would never have dreamed of shooting the <tag>rabbits</> that live in the no man's land along the Wall.   

700228
The farmers are glad to be rid of them. 
However, should anyone be caught poaching <tag>rabbits</> the police are alerted and the villains pursued with 18th Century rigour.   

700229
But next morning (and this, I fear, has now become the long story I was trying to cut short) the rabbit was dead. 
Why give up one's supper-time, disorganise the evening, empty the log basket to provide housing, fetch lettuce and water, and generally cause oneself anxiety, all for the sake of an animal which, given another couple of days, might well have been victim to one of the invited guns &dash. invited, perhaps by the girl's own father, from Keighley ? 
And while we are on the subject, what would the animal rights campaigners have done with the thousands of <tag>rabbits</> during that bleak mid-winter ?

A dog-eared album containing unknown Beatrix Potter drawings has been discovered by Simon Bruton, the Gloucester auctioneer. 
It belongs to a family who knew her at the turn of the century and is to be auctioned at Southam Tythe Barn, near Cheltenham, on 14 December (estimate #2,000). 
It contains three drawings of Cecily Parsley, the <tag>rabbit</> innkeeper, a hand-painted Christmas card and two amateurish Lake District views.  

700231
While a more consistent approach might have been taken to the costumes &dash. some are based far more closely than others on the E.H. Shepard illustrations which provide the prototypes for the characters &dash. the players compensate for this in the quality of their performances. 
Kate Lockey gives a charming account of the honey-guzzling, word-mangling Pooh, while Colin Davidson &dash. if a shade old for the part &dash. suggests the innocent spirit for adventure of Christopher Robin. 
Marie Holmes as the nervy Piglet, John Nolan as the garrulous Owl, and Judy Eden as the troublesome <tag>Rabbit</> all perform competently, and Anne Belton, as Kanga, fusses in matronly fashion over young Roo (Jonathan Eden) and the other animals.   

700232
`There's an outer wall and an inner wall. 
In between there is a little garden, with a pond and guinea-fowl and baby <tag>rabbits</>.   

700233
The day he opened for business a lorry unparked itself, rolled downhill into his office and pinned Ward to the wall. 
Whilst recuperating from two broken legs Ward, sensing the realty world may not be for him, sketched out a character called Crusader <tag>Rabbit</>, a lop-eared super-hero. 

700234
`Some people learn by watching videos of the great players, Borg, McEnroe, Navratilova and Evert. 
I thought it would be fun to make Monica an animated film of a <tag>rabbit</> playing tennis set to music, and this was a success."  

700235
AT CAPE TOWN University Hilliard Festenstein, a distinguished immunologist, was a fairly average student and even today many of his contemporaries are surprised at the heights he reached. 
Shortly after qualifying in Medicine, he came to England to study a Diploma in Bacteriology and returned to the South African Institute of Medical Research where early on he showed his promise. 
He developed a <tag>rabbit</> model for the culture of bacteria that causes syphilis and demonstrated that such rabbits develop the Aids-like syndrome which is now of particular interest.   

700236
The doors open at 7.15 and the show starts at 8 pm. 
What may have been someone's idea of a joke terrified two dogs and left two pet rabbits dead. 
Now the police at Didcot are hoping to trace the owners of the dogs which were shut up with the <tag>rabbits</> in a hutch at Cholsey. 

700237
It treads a fine line between the sublime and an innate ability to offend. 
A myriad of Victorian animal skins and stuffed animals, birds' wings, <tag>rabbit</> jawbones and wax effigies are embellished with gold paint, velvet, lace and jewels and arranged within glass domes, rough wooden boxes and hollowed-out antiquated books telling magical tales of obsessional love, secrets and loss of innocence. 

700238
This has been caused by infected suburban foxes from the east (where until last month there was no vaccination programme) finding their way into the city centre and crossing what was once the border into West Berlin. 
For most people though, the disappearance of the Wall has raised rather more urgent questions questions. 
Property speculators in particular are addressing themselves to the question of what is to be done with the vast stretches of land once occupied by watch towers, border guards, dogs and <tag>rabbits</>.   

700239
The explosion in the rabbit population has resulted from rabbits becoming increasingly immune to the disease which killed millions of rabbits in the fifties and sixties. 
While the rabbit population appears to have built up a genetic resistance to myxomatosis, strains of the disease in Britain appear to be much less virulent in recent years. 
The mild winter weather and early spring together with the increase in winter cropping for <tag>rabbits</> to feed on has also helped to boost the survival rate.   

700240
In Britain we do not like too much death with our dinner. 
We do not buy live poultry from the local market and carry it home squawking and then wring its neck, nor do we insist that the fish we order in a restaurant should have been swimming about only moments before. 
The sight of Peter <tag>Rabbit</> hanging up in an old-fashioned butcher's window brings tears to our eyes, while pretty pink portions prepared and hacked by the supermarket cause no such qualms.
